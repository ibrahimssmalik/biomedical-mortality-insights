Abstract

Perovskite single crystals have attracted tremendous attention owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties and stability compared to typical multicrystal structures. However, the growth of high‐quality perovskite single crystals (PSCs) generally relies on temperature gradients or the introduction of additives to promote crystal growth. In this study, a vacuum evaporation crystallization technique is developed that allows PSCs to be grown under extremely stable conditions at constant temperature and without requiring additives to promote crystal growth. The new method enables the growth of PSCs of unprecedented quality, that is, MAPbBr3 single crystals that exhibit an ultranarrow full width at half maximum of 0.00701°, which surpasses that of all previously reported values. In addition, the MAPbBr3 single crystals deliver exceptional optoelectronic performance, including a long carrier lifetime of 1006 ns, an ultralow trap‐state density of 3.67 × 109 cm−3, and an ultrahigh carrier mobility of 185.86 cm2 V−1 s−1. This method is applicable to various types of PSCs, including organic–inorganic hybrids, fully inorganic structures, and low‐dimensional structures.

A universal and effective vacuum evaporation crystallization (VEC) method is developed for growing high‐quality perovskite single crystals. The method overcomes the adverse effects of temperature fluctuations and auxiliary substances, and is based on the natural volatilization of solvents at chamber pressure lower than the saturated vapor pressure of the solution.

pmc1 Introduction

The rapid development of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) has been a significant driving force behind research into single‐crystal applications, including solar cells,[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] photodetectors,[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] and photomechanical devices.[ 9 , 10 , 11 ] The perovskite single crystals (PSCs) that have been applied in these optoelectronic devices have been grown by various methods, such as solution temperature‐lowering growth (STL),[ 12 ] inverse temperature crystallization (ITC),[ 13 , 14 ] low‐temperature‐gradient crystallization (LTGC),[ 15 ] antisolvent vapor‐assisted crystallization (AVC),[ 16 ] liquid‐diffused separation‐induced crystallization (LDSC),[ 17 , 18 ] and ligand‐assisted growth (LAG).[ 19 , 20 ]

Traditionally, supersaturated MHP solutions have been prepared using methods that involve temperature control or the introduction of new substances (such as antisolvents, silicone oil, or ligands).[ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ] Although these methods have been effective, they introduce certain complexities to the MHP precursors that could potentially affect the quality of the PSCs. For instance, temperature‐controlled crystal growth makes it necessary to maintain a stable temperature gradient and uniform temperature field. This can be challenging because thermal fluctuations and convection in MHP solutions may disrupt the orderly growth of single crystals, which could potentially cause lattice mismatches and dislocations in PSCs.[ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , 22 ] Additionally, the temperature has a limited effect on the solubility of MHPs in solvents.[ 21 ] Other techniques such as AVC, LDGC, and LAG avoid temperature‐related issues, but require the introduction of additional substances into the MHP precursors.[ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ] These substances, although useful in some contexts, can complicate solvent recovery and may influence the quality of PSCs if they become embedded within the cells. An attempt to overcome these problems led to the development of the room‐temperature solvent evaporation‐induced crystallization (RTSEIC) method, a facile approach that relies on the acid‐base reaction between the volatilized solvent and KOH, as well as the hygroscopicity of solid KOH.[ 23 ] Although the RTSEIC method has been successfully applied to grow various perovskite crystals, it is challenging to accurately control the solvent volatilization process determined by the acid‐base reaction and hygroscopicity of KOH. This is largely because the quantity of KOH progressively decreases throughout the reaction, which complicates precise management of the process. Another attempt entailed the development of vacuum‐flash‐assisted solution processing as a technique to grow perovskite films.[ 24 ] However, the quality of the perovskite film was not evidently superior to that of the film prepared with the traditional annealing process. One potential problem with this method is that the solvent is rapidly removed under high‐vacuum conditions. Considering these challenges, the exploration of alternative methods for preparing high‐quality PSCs, which avoid temperature gradients and auxiliary substances, may be worthwhile.

Herein, we report a simple and effective method for growing PSCs using vacuum evaporation crystallization (VEC). The high concentration of the supersaturated MHP solution was well maintained by the extremely low‐pressure solvent evaporation technique, and enabled the growth of single crystals under extremely stable conditions. This approach also obviated the need for a temperature gradient and the use of additives. As a result, we successfully produced a MAPbBr3 single crystal with an ultranarrow rocking curve of 0.00701°. In comparison, the VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystals exhibit a longer fluorescence lifetime, lower trap density, and higher mobility than their counterparts grown at high temperatures (HT‐MAPbBr3). These results encouraged us to explore the VEC method for the growth of all PSC types. Ultimately, we showed that the VEC technique provides a universal strategy for preparing high‐quality PSCs.

2 Results and Discussion

2.1 Nucleation and Growth Mechanism Using VEC

Supersaturation plays a critical role in driving the nucleation and crystal growth of the MHP precursors.[ 15 , 25 ] Consequently, the ability to accurately control precursor supersaturation is an effective strategy for producing high‐quality PSCs. To this effect, we designed a VEC method that does not include the use of temperature gradients and auxiliary substances. The VEC method first entails the preparation of a supersaturated MHP precursor using a low‐pressure solvent evaporation technique under constant temperature conditions. Unlike the traditional processes, which are slower and include steps such as temperature conduction and auxiliary substance diffusion, in the VEC process the pressure can rapidly reach a predetermined value throughout the chamber, enabling more precise control over MHP precursor supersaturation. Rapid and accurate regulation of the system pressure is easily achievable within the confined space and facilitates the fabrication of high‐quality PSCs.

Figure  1a shows a diagram of the experimental setup that was used to grow PSCs using the VEC method. The vacuum pump and pressure controller were used to lower the pressure in the crystal‐growth chamber to the appropriate level. As the chamber pressure decreases, the solvent within the MHP precursor evaporates to accumulate in the space above the solution. To maintain constant pressure throughout the chamber, the vacuum pump continuously removed excess evaporated solvent vapor from the chamber to trigger the spontaneous nucleation of MHP in the supersaturated solution. Under these conditions, the PSCs grew continuously in the consistently supersaturated environment. Throughout the process of growing the PSCs, the sole task for the experimenter was to control the chamber pressure. Additional details regarding the crystal‐growth chamber are provided in the Experimental section.

The impact of the chamber pressure on the solubility of the MAPbBr3 precursor was systematically examined to clarify the effect of the pressure on the crystallization process. When the chamber pressure was lowered to a level below the pressure at which the solvent was saturated, the solvent molecules continually transitioned from the liquid to the gaseous state. Figure 1b shows the phase diagram of the solvent N,N‐dimethylformamide (DMF), which depicts the two phases separated by the pressure–temperature (P–T) curve that was obtained by fitting the saturated pressure data reported for DMF.[ 26 ] The gas (labile) and liquid (stable) phases reside above and below the P–T curves, respectively. Throughout nucleation and crystal growth, controlling the pressure and temperature within the chamber in the area adjacent to the P–T curve (highlighted in blue and representing the metastable region) effectively regulates the thermodynamic solubility of metastable MHP. Measurement of the temperature‐dependent solubility of MAPbBr3 in DMF (Figure S1, Supporting Information) enabled the calculation of its pressure‐dependent solubility, as shown in Figure 1c. The solubility of MAPbBr3 in DMF decreased sharply as the saturated pressure increased from 0.1 to 5 kPa, followed by a slow decline as the saturated pressure further increased to 25 kPa. These results indicate that the MAPbBr3 PSCs grew faster at low rather than at high saturated pressures. According to the Clausius‐Clapeyron law,[ 27 , 28 ] the natural logarithm of the saturated pressure (lnP) is a linear function of the reciprocal of the temperature (1/T). The linear relationship (details described in Equation S1, Supporting Information) can be expressed as ln P =  B(1 − 1/T), where B is a constant characteristic of the substance. Consequently, adjusting the chamber pressure enabled nucleation and crystal growth of the PSCs at lower temperatures.

The solvent evaporation rate significantly influenced the nucleation and crystal growth processes of the PSCs. In our study, the evaporation rate was predominantly influenced by the chamber pressure and temperature. Figure 1d shows a 3D data diagram of the evaporation rate of the MAPbBr3 solution at various temperatures and pressures. Details of the method and the corresponding data that were generated by measuring the evaporation rate are presented in the experimental section and Table S1 (Supporting Information), respectively. Additionally, Figures S2 and S3 (Supporting Information) depict the temperature‐ and pressure‐dependent evaporation rates. Notably, the evaporation rate gradually increased as the pressure decreased from 100 to 5 kPa, followed by a marked increase once the pressure decreased below 5 kPa. At constant chamber pressure, the evaporation rate is known to increase linearly as the temperature rises from 25 °C to 50 °C.[ 29 , 30 ] These results were well aligned with the above pressure‐ and temperature‐dependent solubility data, as shown in Figure 1c and Figure S1 (Supporting Information). The advantages of the VEC method, which requires neither temperature gradients nor the addition of auxiliary substances, is that the method circumvents the problems caused by thermal‐gradient‐induced convection or solvent conversion, which facilitates the control of nucleation and growth. To achieve single crystals of the highest quality, it is imperative to maximize the relative amount of crystal growth while minimizing ancillary nucleation. The crystal growth rate is known to have an important effect on the quality of the resulting single crystals.[ 15 , 18 , 25 ] An in‐depth analysis of the crystallization kinetics and crystal growth rates is provided in the following sections to more clearly understand the practical observations. The evaporation rate derived from the Hertz‐Knudsen equation can be described as[ 31 ] (1) J=aPs−PrM2πRT

where J is the evaporation rate per unit area of the liquid‐vapor interface, a is the fraction of the accessible surface area, Ps is the saturated pressure at a certain temperature, P r is the real chamber pressure, M is the molecular mass of the solvent, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature. By controlling the pressure using the vacuum pump, P r was maintained below P s, which led to continuous evaporation and gradually increased the concentration of the solution. The direct force responsible for driving the interfacial evaporation is the difference between P r and P s, which is the determining step in the crystal growth. The VEC method requires P r to be set to a constant value by using the vacuum pump to adjust the pressure. The evaporation rate is therefore mainly determined by P s. According to Raoult's law[ 32 ] P s of non‐ideal solutions can be described as Ps=xyPs′, where x is the mole fraction of the solvent, y is the activity coefficient of the solvent, and Ps′ is the reference saturated pressure of the solvent in the ideal solution. The evaporation rate varies with the solution concentration because P s is determined by x. Figure 1e shows the change in the volume of the solution (MAPbBr3 in DMF) with evaporation time. Fitting and calculation of the experimental data (Figure 1e) allowed the evaporation rate (dV/dt) of the solvent to be derived (Figure 1f). Continuous evaporation of the solvent caused the concentration of the solution to gradually increase, subsequently resulting in a decrease in the mole fraction of the solvent. Consequently, this led to a reduction in the P s value and a corresponding deceleration of dV/dt. As shown in Figure 1f, the change in dV/dt coincides well with the three stages of the La Mer diagram[ 33 ] similar to those of previous studies.[ 23 ] In the first stage, the dV/dt value of solvent decreased as the concentration of the solution increased. In the second stage, the maximum concentration of the solution C max was reached, accompanied by the corresponding minimum dV/dt. In the third stage, as the concentration of the solution decreased and approached a constant value, C 0, dV/dt initially decreased before gradually stabilizing.

The rate of PSC growth in the MHP solution was determined by the supersaturation of the solution. During the crystal growth stage, the concentration of the solution was kept constant at C 0, that is, the supersaturation of the solution was a stable constant. The volume of the solution decreased as DMF continued to be extracted. Thus, the crystal growth rate (dm/dt) as a function of the volume of the solution can be expressed as (2) dmdt=−C·Mp·ddtVt1−Vt0

where V is the solution volume, C is the molar concentration of the solution, and M p is the molar weight of MAPbBr3, respectively. Equation (1) can also be rewritten as (3) J=ρSM·ddtVt1−Vt0

where S is the effective evaporation area, and ρ is the constant density of the solvent. Substituting Equations (1) and (3) into Equation (2) yields (4) dmdt=−CSMMpρ·J=−Ps−Pr·aCSMMpρ·M2πRT

According to Equation (4), the crystal growth rate is proportional to the evaporation of the solvent and is eventually controlled by the real chamber pressure P r. Therefore, the crystal growth rate can be effectively adjusted by controlling the real chamber pressure to obtain high‐quality single crystals. Based on this theoretical analysis, we effectively controlled the number of grains in each batch (inset of Figure S3, Supporting Information).

The effective use of the VEC method for producing PSCs requires perovskite to be completely absent from the volatile components. This was verified by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to analyze the volatile components (Figure 1g): DMF (pristine DMF), VEC‐MAPbBr3‐DMF (volatiles condensed during the VEC process), MABr‐DMF (MABr dissolved in DMF), and MAPbBr3‐DMF (MAPbBr3 dissolved in DMF). The full FTIR spectrum is shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). Notably, the peak positions of VEC‐MAPbBr3‐DMF were completely aligned with those of pristine DMF.[ 26 ] However, in the case of MABr‐DMF and MAPbBr3‐DMF, the distinct peak in the region 900–1000 cm−1 was ascribed to CH3‐NH3 + (MA+) rocking vibrations.[ 34 , 35 ] This result demonstrates that MA+ did not evaporate with DMF at room temperature, indicating that the composition of the volatiles remained unchanged at low pressure. This implies that the solvent used during the VEC process is easily recoverable for reuse. The results also showed that the solvent in the homogeneous solution evaporated first because of its lower saturation pressure and weaker thermal stability compared to those of the solute, as shown in Figure 1h. Consequently, we selected suitable evaporation rate parameters (temperature and pressure) for the perovskite precursors with specific components to enable nucleation and growth to be more precisely controlled.

Figure  2a shows the three PSCs—MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and MAPbCl3—that were grown using the VEC method. Most PSCs, including mixed organic cations (Cs x FA1‐ x PbI y Br1‐ y , Cs x MA1‐ x PbI y Br1‐ y ), mixed halide anions (MAPbI x Br3‐ x ), fully inorganic compounds (CsPbBr3), and low‐dimensional (BA2PbI2Br2) single crystals, can be grown using the VEC method, as depicted in Figure 2b and Figure S5 (Supporting Information). The sizes of the PSCs are listed in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Their X‐ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, as well as powder diffraction patterns are shown in Figures S6 and S7 (Supporting Information), respectively. The elemental compositions of the PSCs were measured using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS),[ 36 ] as shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). The experimental conditions, including the pressure and temperature, are presented in Table S3 (Supporting Information). The successful growth of a series of PSCs demonstrated the capability, universality, and flexibility of the VEC method.

2.2 Characterization of High‐Quality MAPbBr3 Single Crystals

Changes in the nucleation and crystal growth kinetics of PSCs affect their crystallinity. The crystal structure of the MAPbBr3 single crystals grown using the VEC method was probed using X‐ray diffraction (XRD). For comparison, MAPbBr3 single crystals that were grown using the high‐temperature (HT) method were also investigated.[ 13 ] First, XRD analysis of a powdered single crystal confirmed the crystal structure of MAPbBr3 to be cubic. As shown in Figure  3a, the powder XRD pattern of the MAPbBr3 single crystal grown via the VEC method has diffraction peaks at 15.06°, 21.28°, 30.26°, 33.88°, 37.26°, 43.24°, and 46.14°, which correspond to the (100), (110), (200), (210), (211), (220), and (300) planes, in good agreement with the cubic phase of MAPbBr3.[ 18 , 37 ] In addition, the X‐ray 2θ scan of the maximal facet of the single crystal revealed only those diffraction peaks that correspond to the corresponding planes (Figure 3b), suggesting that the MAPbBr3 single crystal was well structured. To characterize the in‐plane domain properties, the (201) diffraction peak of the VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystal was subjected to a phi‐scan between 0° and 360°. The phi‐scan yielded four well resolved peaks 90° apart, as shown in Figure 3c, and these results demonstrated the fourfold symmetry of the crystal. The fact that only well resolved diffraction lines are observed indicated the high crystalline quality of the in‐plane structure. The orientation and order of the crystals were further investigated and confirmed by pole figure measurements, as shown in Figure 3d. In this investigation, the sample was rotated around the phi‐axis from 0° to 360° in steps of 1° and tilted step‐by‐step around the chi‐axis from 0° to 45°, again in steps of 1° at fixed 2θ values. The appearance of four spots 90° apart in the pole figure demonstrates that the crystal is both in‐plane and out‐of‐plane, which validates the results of the phi‐scan analysis. In addition, the (100) and (200) peaks were further examined carefully using high‐resolution X‐ray rocking curve analysis by assigning a 2θ value of 15.06° to the (100) and 30.26° to the (200) planes, as shown in Figure 3e,f. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of these two peaks are as narrow as 0.00701° and 0.00719° for the (001) and (002) peaks, respectively. These values are much smaller than those of the crystals grown using the HT method, which have FWHMs as wide as 0.01576° and 0.01334°, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this FWHM of 0.00701° is the narrowest among the values of all reported MAPbBr3 single crystals.[ 15 , 17 , 37 , 38 ] Furthermore, the FWHM analysis of each reflection provided the lattice strain of both crystals using the tangent formula. The larger FWHM values of HT‐MAPbBr3 crystals indicate that these crystals experience increased lattice strain. This leads to a higher defect concentration and nonradiative recombination processes to ultimately affect the overall crystalline quality of the single crystals.[ 39 , 40 ] Table S4 (Supporting Information) summarizes the FWHM and lattice strain values of the VEC‐MAPbBr3 and HT‐MAPbBr3 single crystals. These results agree with the trend in the literature, and demonstrate the superior single‐crystal quality of our crystals and the excellent performance of the VEC method for growing perovskite single crystals.

Typically, crystals with improved crystallinities exhibit lower defect densities. In our next experiment, we investigated the optical properties of the MAPbBr3 single crystals. The absorption spectra of VEC‐MAPbBr3 and HT‐MAPbBr3 single crystals are shown in Figure  4a. Both single crystals exhibited a sharp absorption onset at 577 nm, suggesting a low density of in‐gap defect states. The optical bandgap of 2.16 eV, estimated from the Tauc plots, corresponds with the previously reported value for the same single crystal grown using other methods.[ 13 , 18 ] The PL peaks of the VEC‐MAPbBr3 and HT‐MAPbBr3 single crystals appear at 547 nm, as shown in Figure 4b. The PL peak of VEC‐MAPbBr3 has a narrower FWHM of 21.82 nm compared to that of HT‐MAPbBr3. The PL intensity of the VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystal was higher than that of the HT‐MAPbBr3 single crystal, indicating that the former crystal was of a higher quality than the latter crystal. The recombination dynamics of the photoexcited species in both the VEC‐MAPbBr3 and HT‐MAPbBr3 single crystals were investigated using time‐resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 4c. The photoluminescence decay of the VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystal was slower (τ2 ≈ 1006 ns) than that of the HT‐MAPbBr3 single crystal (τ2 ≈ 642 ns) and these values are related to the internal recombination mechanism of the crystals.[ 16 , 25 ] Furthermore, the carrier lifetimes varied in response to changes in the measurement position, excitation power, and crystalline plane,[ 41 , 42 ] as illustrated in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). In summary, the carrier lifetime of the VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystal was significantly longer compared with that of the HT‐MAPbBr3 single crystal, indicating a much lower recombination rate and fewer defect densities. These results again demonstrate that the VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystal is of high quality.

In general, an improvement in the quality of the perovskite crystal leads to improved electrical properties. To investigate the electronic properties of the MAPbBr3 PSCs, we fabricated hole‐only and electron devices (Figure 4d) to calculate the trap density (n trap) and mobility (μh). The space‐charge‐limited current (SCLC) is the most common method for calculating these parameters for PSCs.[ 13 , 18 ] We employed a pulsed voltage sweep SCLC method to minimize the ion migration effect during the measurement to accurately determine the μh and n trap values of MAPbBr3 PSCs.[ 43 , 44 ] We utilized this method to obtain the dark current‐voltage (I‐V) characteristics of the MAPbBr3 devices from 0 to 20 V in increments of 50 mV. A short‐duration voltage pulse (10 ms), followed by a long rest time at 0 V (10 s) was used for this measurement. Figure 4e,f shows a kink in the I–V curve for both the VEC‐MAPbBr3 and HT‐MAPbBr3 devices. Typical I–V characteristics can be divided into three regimes: Ohmic, trap‐filled limit (TFL), and Child regions. In our work, at low bias voltages, the I–V curve followed Ohm's law, which was confirmed by the linearly dependent fit owing to the conductivity of the background charge carriers. As the bias voltage increased, a trap‐filled region started at V TFL, where the current increased rapidly to the TFL, indicating that all available trap states were filled by carriers. n trap was calculated using the following equation[ 45 ] (5) ntraps=2εε0VTFLeL2

where ε is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite (= 25.5), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the electronic charge, and L is the thickness of the single crystal. Using Equation (5), we evaluated the trap density of the crystals grown using both the HT and VEC techniques. The determined average trap density is 1.52  ×  1010 cm−3 for HT‐MAPbBr3, whereas it is only 3.67  ×  109 cm−3 for VEC‐MAPbBr3, as summarized in Figure 4g and Table S5 (Supporting Information, the statistics from single crystals with different thicknesses). The trap density of the VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystal is significantly lower than that of its microcrystalline thin‐film (1017 cm−3) and that of commercial semiconductors, such as CdTe (1011−1013 cm−3), CIGS (1013 cm−3), and Si (1013−1014 cm−3).[ 15 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]

In addition, we fitted the I–V curve to calculate the mobility. Once all available trap states are filled, the current is assumed to follow the Mott‐Gurney law in the absence of trapping. The hole carrier mobility μh is calculated using the Mott‐Gurney law:[ 21 ] (6) JD=9εε0μhV28L3

where J D represents the dark current density, and V denotes the bias voltage. Using Equation (6), we conservatively estimated the hole carrier mobility. Surprisingly, the average hole carrier mobility of the VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystal is as high as 185.86 cm2 V−1 s−1, more than 3 times higher than that of the HT‐MAPbBr3 single crystal (49.52 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results are summarized in Figure 4h and Table S5 (Supporting Information, the statistics from single crystals with different thickness). The essential properties of MAPbBr3 single crystals that were grown using various methods at different temperatures are summarized in Figure 4i and Table S6 (Supporting Information).[ 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 38 , 49 , 50 ] The ultranarrow rocking curve and ultrahigh mobility of the VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystals attest to their excellent crystal quality, which is critical for realizing high‐performance optoelectronic applications.

3 Conclusion

In summary, we reported a universal and effective VEC method suitable for growing high‐quality MHP single crystals. This method relies on the regulation of solvent volatilization by adjusting the chamber pressure, which allows the crystallization and growth of MHP single crystals to be precisely grown in solution. Using the VEC method, we successfully grew a range of perovskite single crystals, including MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl), mixed organic cations (Cs x FA1‐ x PbI y Br1‐ y , Cs x MA1‐ x PbI y Br1‐ y ), mixed halide anions (MAPbI x Br3‐ x ), fully inorganic (CsPbBr3), and low‐dimensional (BA2PbI2Br2) perovskite single crystals. The new method, which circumvents the problem of temperature fluctuation and the need to introduce additives, facilitates the growth of high‐quality MAPbBr3 single crystals characterized by exceptional crystallinity (rocking curve FWHM ≈ 0.00701°), a low trap density (3.67 × 109 cm−3), and an ultrahigh carrier mobility of 185.86 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Chemicals and Reagents

The solvents γ‐butyrolactone (GBL), N, N‐dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Lead iodide (PbI2), lead bromide (PbBr2), lead chloride (PbCl2), cesium bromide (CsBr), formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), methylammonium chloride (MACl), and n‐butylammonium iodide (BAI) were purchased from the Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. All other chemicals were purchased from Aladdin or Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the materials were used as received without further purification.

Experimental Setup for Crystal Growth via VEC

As shown in Figure 1a and Figure S10a (Supporting Information), the crystal‐growth equipment consisted mainly of a customized stainless‐steel cubic vacuum chamber (64 × 64 × 64 cm). Several flange interfaces were designed and mounted on the walls of the chamber, to which the temperature and pressure controllers were attached for data collection, environmental parameter control, maintenance, and monitoring. For precise and dependable pressure control and measurement, an electronic mass flow meter (Figure S10b, Supporting Information), an oil‐free vacuum pump (XDS35i, Edwards Ltd., Flintshire, UK) (Figure S10c, Supporting Information), a pressure controller (946 Vacuum System Controller, MKS Instruments, Andover, MA, USA) (Figure S10d, Supporting Information), and a pressure sensor (model: KJL300808, MKS Instruments, Andover, MA, USA) (Figure S10e, Supporting Information) were utilized to dynamically regulate the chamber pressure (≥ 0.1 Pa) within the crystal growth chamber. Temperature control and measurements were performed using a customized heating and cooling stage (Figure S10f, Supporting Information) installed inside the chamber. This stage was connected to an mK1000 temperature controller (Figure S10g, Supporting Information) and a liquid‐nitrogen pump (Figure S10h, Supporting Information) via an electronic feedthrough and two gas feedthroughs (Figure S10i, Supporting Information).

VEC Growth of the Perovskite Single Crystals

For the VEC method, AX (FAI, BAI, and CsX) and PbX2 (X = I, Br, and Cl) were dissolved at appropriate molar ratios in organic solvents at different concentrations for single‐crystal growth. The solution was maintained at room temperature and stirred overnight. Finally, the precursor solution was filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene filter with a pore size of 0.22 µm. The prepared precursor solution was then placed in a crystal growth chamber (the equipment was custom‐designed and ‐built in the laboratory) at an appropriate pressure and room temperature for crystallization.

Growth of MAPbBr3 Single Crystals at High Temperature

In the HT method, MABr and PbBr2 were dissolved at a 1:1 molar ratio in DMF as the solvent. To ensure that the components were completely dissolved, the solution was stirred overnight at a specific temperature. The precursor solution was filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene filter with a 0.22 µm pore size. Then, the prefabricated solution was placed on a hot plate and the temperature was increased to 80 °C.

Solubility Test

MAPbBr3 powder was prepared by grinding a large piece of a single crystal into a fine powder in an agate mortar. DMF (5 mL) was placed in a vial on a hot plate and stirred. While keeping the temperature of the DMF constant, a small amount of MAPbBr3 powder was added in 0.005 g increments until the solution reached saturation. Saturation conditions were assumed to have been reached when the MAPbBr3 no longer completely dissolved within 30 min of addition to the DMF. This process was repeated at various temperatures.

Evaporation Rate Test

A high‐precision electronic mass scale was placed in the crystal growth chamber and a quartz Petri dish with an inner diameter of 5 cm was placed on the scale. To maintain the required temperature and pressure in the chamber, 10 mL of sample (DMF or solution) was added to the quartz Petri dish. Electronic scale mass data were read hourly. The sample volatilization rate was equal to the ratio of the mass change to the product of the evaporation area and time.

Characterization

The FTIR spectra were recorded on a Spectrum II infrared spectrometer in the 400–4000 cm−1 wavenumber range at a resolution of 2 cm−1. Powder X‐ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using an X‐ray diffractometer (D8‐advance, Bruker) with Cu‐Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 5°−80°. The high‐resolution X‐ray diffraction measurement was performed using an X'Pert MRD with Cu‐Kα1 radiation at V = 40 kV and I = 20 mA. The VEC‐MAPbBr3 single crystal was characterized by XRD 2θ scans, phi‐scans, omega scans, and pole figure measurements. The UV–Vis absorbance spectrum was acquired at room temperature using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer in reflection mode with an integrating sphere attachment operating in the 200−700 nm region. Steady‐state and time‐resolved photoluminescence measurements of the MAPbBr3 single crystals were performed using an FLS‐920 fluorescence spectrometer. Dark I–V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 instrument. The device was maintained in the dark at room temperature. A nonlinear response was observed and analyzed according to SCLC theory. The device area is 0.04 cm2.
