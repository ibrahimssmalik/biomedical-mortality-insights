ABSTRACT

Superconductivity (SC) was experimentally observed for the first time in antimony polyhydride. The diamond anvil cell combined with a laser heating system was used to synthesize the antimony polyhydride sample at high pressure and high temperature. In-situ high pressure transport measurements as a function of temperature with an applied magnetic field were performed to study the SC properties. It was found that the antimony polyhydride samples show superconducting transition with critical temperature Tc 116 K at 184 GPa. The investigation of SC at magnetic field revealed the superconducting coherent length of ∼40 Å based on the Ginzburg Landau (GL) equation. Antimony polyhydride superconductor has the second highest Tc in addition to sulfur hydride among the polyhydrides of elements from main groups IIIA to VIIA in the periodic table.

Antimony hydride was successfully synthesized and discovered to host superconductivity with Tc about 116 K that is the second highest among the experimentally reported covalently bonded polyhydrides

pmcINTRODUCTION

Recent interest has been growing rapidly as to the exploration of new high temperature superconductors in polyhydrides based on the scenario that precompression effects will reduce the hydrogen metallization pressure to an experimentally accessible scope [1–11]. After the sulfur hydrides were theoretically predicted to host high temperature superconductivity (SC) [4,5], it was soon experimentally discovered that SH3 did exhibit SC with transition temperature Tc about 203 K at 155 GPa [12]. This report of high Tc superconductor of SH3 accelerated the process of experimentally searching for other binary hydride superconductors [13–26], such as the discovery of SC at megabar pressure in LaH10 with Tc = 250–260 K [13,15], YH9 with Tc = 243–262 K [17,27] and CaH6 with Tc of ∼210 K [18,19]. Besides the rare earth polyhydride and alkali earth polyhydride superconductors with Tc exceeding 200 K, other metal polyhydrides with moderate Tc have also been experimentally reported [16,20–26], such as ThH10 with Tc = 161 K at 175 GPa [20]. For the heavy rare earth elements with f shell fully filled, the lutetium hydride of Lu4H23 was reported to exhibit SC with Tc = 71 K at 218 GPa [21]. The hydrides of IVB and VB group metal of Zr, Hf and Ta were found to host SC at megabar pressure with Tc = 71 K [22], 83 K [23] and 30 K [26], respectively. Most discovered binary hydride superconductors are found to be located in group IIA and IIIB in the periodic table and have electronegative values smaller than 1.5. It is a fundamental consideration that the metal element with small electronegativity can provide electrons to occupy the anti-bonding orbital of hydrogen in order to prevent the formation of hydrogen molecules during the hydrogen metallization process upon compression. However, for the elements from main group IIIA to VIIA in the periodic table, only a few covalently bonded hydride superconductors have been experimentally discovered. Beside SH3 with Tc = 203 K, SnHn was reported to have SC with Tc about 70 K [25], and phosphorus hydride was found to be superconducting with Tc about 103 K by using PH3 as the precursor [24,28]. Here we report an experimental discovery of another covalently bonded hydride superconductor of antimony polyhydride superconductor. The SC with Tc = 116 K was experimentally observed to be the second highest Tc so far reported in the polyhydrides of elements in main group IIIA to VIIA in the periodic table.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The sample was synthesized at 184 GPa with the sample chamber and electrodes assembled as shown in Fig. S1. The temperature dependence of resistance measured at the same pressure is shown in Fig. 1. The resistance decreases smoothly with temperature decrease before it drops sharply at the onset temperature 116 K and reaches zero gradually. The zero resistance is presented clearly in the inset of Fig. 1, which rules out the possibility of the resistance drop with an origin from the structural or magnetic phase transitions. Therefore, it is suggested that a superconducting transition happens. To clearly determine the transition temperature, the resistance derivative over temperature is plotted in the inset of Fig. 1. The derivative curve shows a sharp peak, and onset superconducting transition temperature Tc can be determined to be 116 K by the right upturn temperature. The kinks during the drop in resistance suggest multistep superconducting transitions, which are possibly caused by the generated antimony polyhydrides with different hydrogen content as can be generally seen in other polyhydride superconductors [13,18,19].

Figure 1. (a) The temperature dependence of resistance for antimony polyhydride sample measured at 184 GPa. (b) The upper inset is the derivative of resistance over temperature to clearly show the superconducting onset temperature (Tc). The lower inset demonstrates the zero resistance at low temperature.

The dependence of the transition on the magnetic field was studied. As shown in Fig. 2, the transition temperature is suppressed gradually by applying a magnetic field, which is consistent with the superconducting properties and further confirms the nature of superconducting transition. The Tc  90% values at different magnetic fields were determined by the criteria of temperature where the resistance drops to 90% relative to the normal state at the onset temperature as shown by the dashed line in Fig. 2. The synthesis of polyhydride antimony is rather challenging because it is extremely difficult to heat the sample by laser. The synthesis can only be carried out with high laser power that frequently damages the anvils. This prevents us from further increasing or releasing pressure to study the pressure dependence of SC as we have performed for other polyhydride superconductor studies [18,26]. The zero resistance at zero field is suppressed by applying a magnetic field. It is speculated that there should exist weak superconducting links between the generated superconducting crystalline grains. Upon high magnetic field application and penetration of the superconducting sample, the weak superconducting links would be broken and suppress the zero resistance as observed in granular superconductors [29–31].

The upper critical magnetic field μ0Hc2(T) versus temperature was plotted in Fig. 3, which presents a straight line. After linearly fitting the data, the slope of |dHc/dT| was obtained to be 0.25 T/K. This slope is significantly smaller than those of clathrate hydride superconductors, such as 1.73 T/K for CaH6 (Tc ∼ 210 K) [18], 1.03 T/K for LaH10 (Tc ∼ 250 K) [13] and 1.06 T/K for Lu4H23 (Tc ∼ 71 K) [21], while it is comparable to those of covalent bonding dominant hydride superconductors of SH3 ( ∼ 0.5 T/K, Tc ∼ 203 K) [32] and SnHn (0.21 T/K, Tc ∼ 71 K) [25]. It seems that the magnetic vortex pinning force in covalently bonded hydride superconductors is generally weaker than that for ionic bonding dominant clathrate types. According to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory, the μ0Hc2(0) controlled by the orbital deparing mechanism in a dirty limit (μ0Hc2Orb(0)) can be estimated with a formula of μ0Hc2(T) = −0.69 × [dHc2/dT|Tc] × Tc. Taking the slope of −0.25 T/K and Tc90% = 115 K, the μ0Hc2Orb(0) can be calculated to be ∼20 T. The μ0Hc2(0) can also be estimated by using the Ginzburg Landau (GL) theory with an equation of μ0Hc2(T) = μ0Hc2GL(0)(1−(T/Tc)2). The equation was fitted using the μ0Hc2(T) as shown in Fig. 3. The fitting yields the parameter of μ0Hc2GL(0) ∼ 16 T that is comparable to μ0Hc2Orb(0). In addition the μ0Hc2(0) limited by spin deparing mechanism associated with the Zeeman effect (μ0Hc2P(0)) for the case of a weak coupling superconducting system is determined by the formula of μ0Hc2P(0) = 1.86 × Tc. The μ0Hc2P(0) can be calculated to be 211 T by using the Tc90% = 115 K. The small μ0Hc2Orb(0) value relative to μ0Hc2P(0) is indicative that the Cooper pair is broken through the orbital depairing mechanism. Finally, the GL coherent length ξ is estimated to be ∼40 Å by the equation of μ0Hc2GL(0) = Φ0/2πξ2 where Φ0 = 2.067 × 10−15 Web is the magnetic flux quantum.

The antimony hydride SC has been theoretically investigated [33–35]. In these studies, only SbH and SbH4 are predicted to be stable above 150 GPa, and SbH4 was proposed to be SC with very high Tc value of ∼100 K at 150 GPa [34,35]. SbH3 however was only expected to be stable above 300 GPa with a very low superconducting Tc ∼20 K [35]. We speculate that our observed SC with Tc ∼116 K is probably from the P63/mmc-SbH4 phase. We preliminarily investigated the superconducting phase by in-situ high pressure X-ray experiments. The sample was synthesized at 208 GPa using the standard symmetric diamond anvil cell specifically for synchrotron radiation measurements. The diffraction pattern presented in Fig. S2 shows the possible existence of the hexagonal phase of SbH4.

For the binary hydrides with the elements located in main group IIIA to VIIA of the period table, covalent bonding is usually dominant between the element and hydrogen since their electronegativity values are comparable. The typical example is SH3, where strong polar covalent bonding was proposed between the adjacent S and H atoms by the calculated electron localization function (ELF) [5]. For SbH4 the calculated ELF at 150 GPa also presents a covalent bonding between neighbor Sb and H atoms [34]. Hence SbH4 is another experimentally reported covalently bonded high Tc hydride superconductor in addition to SH3. According to the structure model of SbH4 at 150 GPa [34], the schematic view of the crystal structure is plotted as shown in Fig. S3a. There are two Wyckoff positions for hydrogen atoms: H1 (4e) and H2 (4f) denoted with yellow and green colors, respectively. H1 atoms are located in the octahedral interstitial sites of Sb lattice (Fig. S3b) while H2 atoms are located in the tetrahedral interstice (Fig. S3c). Unlike SH3, H1 atoms in SbH4 form quasi hydrogen molecules with the bonding length of 0.83 Å (Fig. S3a), while the second shortest H-H distance is ∼1.73 Å. In SH3 the H-H covalent bond is considered to be absent due to the large H-H distance (1.49 Å), while the metalized S-H valence bond is believed to be responsible for the high Tc SC. The larger second shortest H-H distance in SbH4 relative to the shortest one in SH3 implies that SbH4 should have a weaker H-H bonding strength and thus lead to a relatively weaker electron-phonon coupling. That is why SbH4 has a lower Tc than SH3. Despite all this, antimony binary hydride experimentally shows a high temperature SC with Tc exceeding 110 K, the second highest so far for the polyhydride compounds of elements from main group IIIA to VIIA in the periodic table.

CONCLUSION

In summary the antimony polyhydride superconductor has been experimentally discovered. The antimony polyhydride shows SC with Tc ∼ 116 K at 184 GPa. The upper magnetic field is μ0Hc2(0) ∼20 T with a GL coherent length ∼40 Å.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The antimony polyhydrides were synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions based on diamond anvil cell high pressure techniques in combination with laser heating. The diamond anvils with the culet diameter of 50 μm beveled to 300 μm were used for the megabar pressure experiments. The gasket made of T301 stainless was prepressed to a thickness of ∼10 μm, and drilled with a hole of 300 μm diameter. Then the hole was filled with aluminum oxide that was densely pressed before being further drilled to a hole of 40 μm diameter to serve as the sample chamber. The ammonia borane (AB) was filled into the high pressure chamber to act as the hydrogen source as well as the pressure transmitting medium. The Pt was deposited on the surface of the anvil culet to serve as the inner electrodes. An antimony foil with the size of 20 μm(L) × 20 μm(W) × 1 μm(T) was stacked on the inner electrodes. The pressure was calibrated by the shift in Raman peak of diamond. The details are described in the ATHENA procedure reported in Ref [36].

A YAG laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm was used to heat the high pressure sample in situ. The laser beam size is about 5 μm in diameter. The sample was laser heated at 2000 K for several minutes during which hydrogen released from the AB would react with the antimony to form antimony polyhydride. The high temperature was determined by fitting the black body irradiation spectra. The synthesis pressure was kept unchanged after the synthesis for further electric transport measurements. The high pressure electric conductivity experiments were performed in a MagLab system with temperatures from 300 K to 1.5 K and a magnetic field up to 5 Tesla. A Van der Pauw method was employed as the general high pressure resistance measurement [37,38] while the applied electric current was set to be 1 mA.

The details of in-situ high pressure X-ray diffraction experiments can be seen in the online supplementary material.
