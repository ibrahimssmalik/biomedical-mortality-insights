This study aimed to assess the effect of intraocular pressure (IOP) changes on biometry and intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation in patients diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT). This prospective non-randomized cohort study enrolled patients with diagnosed POAG and OHT, presenting with IOP levels exceeding 25 mmHg. Thai Clinical Trials Registry number was TCTR20180912007. Optical biometry, encompassing measurements such as corneal thickness (CCT), keratometry, anterior chamber depth (ACD), and axial length, was conducted before and after IOP reduction. The IOL power was also determined using the SRK/T formula. The main outcomes measured were alterations in biometry and IOL power. Correlations between IOP, biometric parameters, and IOL power were analyzed. In total, 28 eyes were included in the study, with a mean patient age of 65.71±10.2 years. After IOP reduction, all biometric parameters, except CCT and ACD, exhibited a decrease without reaching statistical significance (all p>0.05). Meanwhile, IOL power showed a slight increase of 0.214±0.42 diopters (P = 0.035). The correlation between IOP and biometric parameters was found to be weak. However, there was a moderate correlation between IOP and IOL power (r2 = 0.267). Notably, IOL power tended to increase by more than 0.5 diopters when IOP decreased by more than 10 mmHg (p < 0.001). In conclusion, changes in IOP among patients with POAG and OHT do not significantly impact biometry and IOL power calculations. Nonetheless, it may be prudent to consider a slight adjustment in IOL power when IOP is lowered by more than 10 mmHg.

pmcIntroduction

Biometry plays a crucial role in ensuring the success of cataract surgery. Advanced technology has allowed for accurate measurements, including calculations of intraocular lens (IOL) power. However, there have been reports of unexpected refractive outcomes following cataract surgery, particularly in cases where biometry measurements were inconsistent or inaccurate, leading to improper IOL power determination [1]. Typically, the newer IOL formulas rely on several biometric parameters: central corneal thickness (CCT), keratometry (K), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness, and axial length (AL). Certain ocular pathologies can induce changes in ocular dimensions, resulting in deviations in biometric measurements from their normal values. Prior research has shown that elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with or without glaucoma can alter ocular biometry and potentially affect IOL calculations [2, 3].

The incidence of cataracts and glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), increases with age. Ocular hypertension (OHT) is considered a major risk factor for the development of POAG [4]. Clinically, many patients present with cataracts and coexisting POAG or OHT. The management of these patients is based on the severity of the diseases. Most ophthalmologists aim to lower IOP to near-normal levels before cataract surgery [5], using either antiglaucoma medications or glaucoma surgery if necessary. In cases where medical treatment fails, surgical drainage of aqueous humor to bypass the trabecular pathway may be considered to achieve sufficient IOP reduction. Previous studies have shown that a significant decrease in IOP following trabeculectomy leads to change in ocular biometry, including ACD and AL, which persist for up to 5 years [6–8]. These findings suggest that substantial changes in IOP can impact biometry. Fortunately, most glaucoma patients respond well to medications [9].

Several publications have suggested that early phacoemulsification is a favorable option for cataract patients with comorbid POAG and OHT. Such a procedure could not only address the cataract issue but also aid in reducing IOP [10, 11]. However, this raises concerns about the impact of IOP changes on cataract surgery outcomes. As mentioned earlier, changes in IOP can affect biometric measurements. The IOL power calculated when the IOP is high before cataract surgery may not be accurate, leading to suboptimal refractive outcomes. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the influence of IOP on biometric measurements and the IOL power obtained from a standard optical biometer in patients with POAG and OHT. We aimed to compare the findings before and after the reduction in IOP.

Materials and methods

This study was approved by the Siriraj Institutional Review Board, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand, and registered with the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR20180912007). All study procedures adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the study commenced.

This prospective nonrandomized cohort study was conducted at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Ophthalmology, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand, between April 2017 and March 2018. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients aged over 20 years diagnosed with POAG or OHT by a glaucoma specialist (D.S.); (2) diagnosis determined based on slit-lamp examination, gonioscopy, optic disc appearance, and visual field test; and (3) IOP levels exceeding 25 mmHg as measured by the standard Goldman applanation technique. Subjects were excluded if they had corneal and/or ocular surface diseases that could affect IOP measurement, K, or refractive status; had a history of ophthalmic surgery; presented with a dense cataract obstructing AL measurement and IOL computation; or were unable to cooperate during the measurements.

All enrolled patients underwent biometry and CCT measurements before undergoing a comprehensive eye examination and initiating antiglaucoma treatment. Biometric measurements, including K, ACD, and AL, were obtained using a standard time-domain optical coherence interferometry-based optical biometer (IOLMaster 500, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) by a single operator. The IOL power was then calculated using the Sanders–Retzlaff–Kraff/Theoretical (SRK/T) formula for a single-piece foldable IOL (Alcon SA60WF), with an A-constant of 119.0 provided by the IOLMaster. The refractive target was set at emmetropia. Subsequently, CCT was measured using a noncontact air puff tonometer (CT-80 Noncontact Computerized Tonometer, Topcon Corp, Tokyo, Japan).

Following the collection of all parameters, patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination. The IOP was confirmed using Goldmann applanation tonometry, consistent with the predefined criteria. Antiglaucoma medications were then prescribed based on the judgment of the glaucoma specialist. Once the IOP was stabilized at or below 20 mmHg, the patients underwent biometry and CCT measurements with the same technician. The interval between the first and second measurements for all subjects was mandated to be within 6 months. Data from longer periods were excluded.

Statistical analysis

All data were recorded in an Excel 2013 spreadsheet (Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA) and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). The IOL power, CCT, K, ACD, and AL values are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Estimation accuracy was evaluated using a 95% confidence interval. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) were performed for all comparisons, with statistical significance defined as a P value of less than 0.05. The correlation between the IOP and IOL change was analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was employed to determine the threshold of IOP change that impacts IOL power.

The reliability of the measurements was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. Coefficient values range from 0 to 1, with values above 0.7 signifying acceptable agreement, 0.8 to 0.9 indicating good agreement, and above 0.9 denoting excellent agreement between measurements [12].

Results

A total of 28 eyes from 18 patients diagnosed with POAG and OHT were included in this study. The mean age of the study population was 65.71±10.2 years, ranging from 50 to 89 years. The demographic characteristics of all patients are detailed in Table 1. All patients received treatment with antiglaucoma medications and were scheduled for follow-up visits. The mean IOP before and after treatment with antiglaucoma medications was 28.64±3.31 mmHg and 17.17±2.12 mmHg, respectively. The change in IOP after treatment was statistically significant (P<0.001), with a mean reduction of 11.46 ± 4.12 mmHg. Table 2 summarizes the IOL power and biometric parameters measured before and after treatment.

The measurement of IOL power showed a statistically significant difference after lowering the IOP to 20 mmHg or below, as obtained by the IOLMaster (IOL power change, 0.214±0.42 D; P = 0.035). However, no significant changes were observed in other parameters after lowering the IOP.

Pearson analysis revealed a moderate correlation (r2 = 0.267) between the change in IOL power and the change in IOP (Fig 1). An area under the curve of 0.905 (95% CI: 0.79–1.00) indicated a significant cut-off point between a reduction in IOP greater than 10 mmHg and a shift in IOL power of 0.5 diopters. The association of the IOP over 10 and the IOL power change (0.5 diopter) was significant (p < 0.001). The odd ratio was 27.0 (2.5, 291.2).

Discussion

Accurate preoperative IOL power calculations are crucial for achieving the desired refractive outcomes in cataract surgery. Patients with POAG and OHT often develop cataracts, and high IOP is a modifiable risk factor in these individuals [13]. This study aimed to assess the impact of IOP reduction on IOL power calculations and various biometric parameters, including AL, steepest and flattest K, and ACD. In this study, all subjects had an AL exceeding 22 mm, and the SRK/T formula provided accurate results for this average AL. The SRK/T formula, introduced in 1990 by Retzlaff, Kraff, and Sanders, is considered a third-generation formula developed explicitly for AL values greater than 22 mm. [14]. Moreover, we have used SRK/T formula in our regular practice and already had a good IOL optimization. By opting an IOP threshold of 25 mmHg, the substantial IOP changes are potential to be clinically meaningful.

Optical biometers have gained popularity and are widely used for IOL measurements. Their accuracy is comparable to that of high-precision immersion ultrasound [15]. In our study, we utilized the IOLMaster5 to measure biometric parameters. This approach avoided the globe indentation and deformation that may occur with contact ultrasonic methods, which tend to underestimate AL. Additionally, all biometric measurements were obtained by the same operator (S.K.) to control for technical factors. Our use of a noncontact optical biometer with a reliability check in age-matched patients enhanced the robustness of our study.

We observed a statistically significant increase in SRK/T-calculated emmetropia IOL power after IOP reduction (0.214±0.42 D; P = 0.035). However, there were no significant changes in AL, steepest and flattest K, or K. The correlation between the change in IOP and the change in IOL power was good inverse (r2 = 0.267). This shift might be attributable to a reduction in AL following the decrease in IOP. Moreover, an IOP drop exceeding 10 mmHg was found to correspond with a 0.5 diopter shift in IOL power.

Husain et al [6]. conducted a study on patients with POAG and PACG who underwent trabeculectomy to lower IOP. They observed a decrease in both ACD and AL following surgery, and these changes persisted for up to 5 years. Similarly, Francis et al [16]. reported a reduction in AL: -0.15 mm at 3 months after trabeculectomy and glaucoma drainage device surgery, as measured by the IOLMaster.

In our study, we also observed a slight reduction in AL after the decrease in IOP, although the difference was not statistically significant (-0.035±0.206 mm; P = 0.446). This finding aligns with the proposed mechanism of AL reduction after trabeculectomy, which involves an increase in choroidal and ocular wall thickness associated with the lowering of IOP [17, 18]. Accurate AL measurements are crucial for precise IOL power calculation. Cruysberg et al. [19] reported that AL changes of 0.03 mm and 0.08 mm corresponded to refractive prediction errors of 0.08–0.13 D and 0.20–0.34 D, respectively. As the AL decreases, there is an escalation in refractive prediction error, resulting in a hyperopic shift.

In contrast to AL, changes in ACD are minor and transient, and they do not appear to be influenced by a decrease in IOP. Some studies have observed a temporary shallowing of the ACD following trabeculectomy, but the ACD tends to revert to its presurgical depth within the second week after the operation [20, 21]. Karasheva et al. [22] also demonstrated that a decline in IOP following filtration surgery does not correlate with a shallowing anterior chamber, as measured by the IOLMaster.

Our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the small number of study subjects may limit the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, we did not conduct subgroup analysis based on AL, which means that the SRK/T formula may not be suitable for individuals with short AL (<22.00 mm) or extremely long AL. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to validate our results. It is also recommended to utilize newer optical biometers with high repeatability and reliability to investigate the impact of IOP on IOL power using different IOL formulas.

Despite these limitations, the effect size of the differences in parameters was small, which enhances the precision of IOL power calculations. For optimal visual results, it is advisable to measure biometric parameters using noncontact optical biometry for IOL power calculation after stabilizing and effectively controlling IOP.

In conclusion, changes in IOP have a significant impact on IOL power computations. Lowering IOP through antiglaucoma medication treatment leads to a significant increase in emmetropia IOL power. Surgeons should consider the postoperative hyperopic shift of at least 0.5 diopter in patients with an IOP reduction of ≥10 mmHg during cataract surgery.

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: In general, the process of calculating the power of the intraocular lens and cataract surgery for patients with high eye pressure is not done until the eye pressure is controlled and stabilized for several reasons, some of which are mentioned in this article, so maybe the goal From this study, it contains only a few exceptions and exceptions, and it does not seem practical

As you mentioned, eye biometric changes with eye pressure changes have been mentioned in numerous articles. What is the novelty of the article's message?

Why srkt formula?

While the cct and acd index are not directly used in this formula, and one of your goals is to check the changes of these biometric indices with changes in eye pressure and then calculated changes in iol power.

How is the correlation of two eyes considered?

A change of 0.2 in the mean dif of lens power cannot have an effect on the clinical results

According to the variables that you checked, as well as the reduction in the use of 3rd generation formulas and the widespread use of modern formulas or artificial intelligence, it would be better if you used these formulas, which are better in terms of accuracy in calculating the lens in different AL values.

Many times since 2000 with the advent of optical biometrics, these points have been reviewed and mentioned in various studies.

This amount of error in ref can be different depending on other eye biometric characteristics

Reviewer #2: In this study, the authors evaluated the effects of intraocular pressure change on intraocular lens power calculation in primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension and observed a nonsignificant reduction in some biometric parameters.

Minor revisions are needed to improve this well-conducted study.

The change in IOL power is different between abstract and text. “IOL power showed a slight increase of 0.213±0.54 diopters (P=0.076) vs (IOL power change, 0.213±0.377 D; P=0.006)”

Figure Legends for Fig 1 and Fig 2 seem to be interchanged.

Reviewer #3: • Some statement in the “Introduction” need to be supported by references: “Most ophthalmologists aim to lower IOP to near-normal levels before cataract surgery, using either antiglaucoma medications or glaucoma surgery if necessary”, “Fortunately, most glaucoma patients respond well to medications”.

• The number of eyes involved in the study needed a statistically justified sample size calculation. The inclusion of both eyes of the same patient in the study also needs statistical justification.

• In the abstract, the statement “IOL power showed a slight increase of 0.213±0.54 diopters (P=0.076)” is not accurate as p=0.006 in table 2.

• Figure 2 and its legend are not clear.

• The control group mentioned at the end of the results has no place. If it is a case-control study, this should be considered in the methodology and the data of the control group should be presented in tables in comparison with the study group.

• These statements in the discussion are not supported in the results: “more hyperopic shift in patients whose IOP was reduced by ≥8 mmHg” and “IOP drop exceeding 10 mmHg was found to correspond with a 0.5 diopter shift in IOL power”.

• The second part of the conclusion is not supported by the results.

Dear editor and reviewers,

We appreciate you taking the time to review this article. Thank you very much indeed for your thoughtful comments.

We has corrected Data availability statement in a system to The datasets generated and analyzed during the study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request that related with in manuscript.

Response to editor.

1. Please justify the inclusion of both eyes of some participants rather than randomisation of one eye only.

Response:

According to the uneven incident of OHT and POAG with IOP higher than 25 mmHg particitated in the current study, eyes which met the inclusion criteria were recruited. However, we have used Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) for the statistical analysis to compensate the incorporation of data derived from bilateral eyes and unilateral eye participants.

We changed a sentence in statistical analysis (page 8, line135-139). “Generalized estimating equation (GEE) were performed for all comparisons, with statistical significance defined as a P value of less than 0.05.”

The results were the same after changing the method of statistical analysis. We have already revised the results in table 2 as below.

2. Please justify the use of the cutoff IOP of 25 mmHg (instead of 21 mmHg) for study inclusion.

Response:

In clinical practice, patients with ocular hypertension (OHT) are often untreated if their intraocular pressure (IOP) are below 25 mmHg. Mild reduction of IOP may not significantly affect the ocular biometry. By opting an IOP threshold of 25 mmHg, the substantial IOP changes are potential to be clinically meaningful. This approach reduces data noise and enhances the statistical power of the analysis.

We added a sentence in discussion.

“By opting an IOP threshold of 25 mmHg, the substantial IOP changes are potential to be clinically meaningful.” (page 10, line176-177)

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

3. Was there a statistically significant reduction of IOP after medical treatment? Please provide p values.

Response:

Yes, there was. The change in IOP after treatment was statistically significant (P<0.001), with a mean reduction of 11.46 ± 4.12 mmHg. We added a p-value in the sentence. Page 8 line 150.

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

Response to reviewer #1 .

1. In general, the process of calculating the power of the intraocular lens and cataract surgery for patients with high eye pressure is not done until the eye pressure is controlled and stabilized for several reasons, some of which are mentioned in this article, so maybe the goal From this study, it contains only a few exceptions and exceptions, and it does not seem practical

As you mentioned, eye biometric changes with eye pressure changes have been mentioned in numerous articles. What is the novelty of the article's message?

Response:

Up to present, there has been no study analyzed the effect of IOP changes on intraocular lens (IOL) power. In the current study, we emphasize this effect and point out the magnitude of IOL power changes after significant IOP reduction. This provides accurate lens values, resulting in good vision after cataract surgery.

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

2. Why srkt formula?

While the cct and acd index are not directly used in this formula, and one of your goals is to check the changes of these biometric indices with changes in eye pressure and then calculated changes in iol power.

Response:

The axial lengths of our patients were in average range. Any IOL formulas should yield accurate results. Moreover, we have used SRK/T formula in our practice and already had a good IOL optimization.

We added a sentence in discussion.

“Moreover, we have used SRK/T formula in our regular practice and already had a good IOL optimization.” (page 10, line 175)

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

3. How is the correlation of two eyes considered?

Response:

We use generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) for the incorporation of the correlation between the two eyes of the same participant.

We changed a sentence in statistical analysis (page 8, line135-139). “Generalized estimating equation (GEE) were performed for all comparisons, with statistical significance defined as a P value of less than 0.05.”

The results were the same after changing the method of statistical analysis. We have already revised the results in table 2.

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

4. A change of 0.2 in the mean dif of lens power cannot have an effect on the clinical results

According to the variables that you checked, as well as the reduction in the use of 3rd generation formulas and the widespread use of modern formulas or artificial intelligence, it would be better if you used these formulas, which are better in terms of accuracy in calculating the lens in different AL values.

Many times since 2000 with the advent of optical biometrics, these points have been reviewed and mentioned in various studies.

This amount of error in ref can be different depending on other eye biometric characteristics

Response:

Thank you for your point of view. It is true that the modern IOL formulas may yield more accurate results. As we mentioned earlier, the axial lengths of our patients were in average range. Any IOL formulas should yield similar results. Moreover, we have used SRK/T formula in our practice and already had a good IOL optimization.

We added a sentence in discussion.

“Moreover, we have used SRK/T formula in our regular practice and already had a good IOL optimization.” (page 10, line 175)

Response to reviewer # 2.

Reviewer #2: In this study, the authors evaluated the effects of intraocular pressure change on intraocular lens power calculation in primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension and observed a nonsignificant reduction in some biometric parameters.

Minor revisions are needed to improve this well-conducted study.

1. The change in IOL power is different between abstract and text. “IOL power showed a slight increase of 0.213±0.54 diopters (P=0.076) vs (IOL power change, 0.213±0.377 D; P=0.006)”

Response:

Thank you for your kindness and sorry for the confusion.

We use generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) for the incorporation of the correlation between the two eyes of the same participant. So IOL power showed a slight increase of0.214±0.42 diopters (P=0.035).

We corrected them in abstract, text and table 2.

Page 3 line 57. Meanwhile, IOL power showed a slight increase of 0.214±0.42 diopters (P=0.035).

Page 10 line 158. (IOL power change, 0.214±0.377 D; P=0.035).

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

2. Figure Legends for Fig 1 and Fig 2 seem to be interchanged.

Response:

The legend of Figure 1 is “Fig 1. Scatter plot of correlation of IOL power change and IOP change.” Page 10, line 165.

We decided to delete Figure 2.

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

Response to reviewer #3.

Reviewer #3:

1• Some statement in the “Introduction” need to be supported by references: “Most ophthalmologists aim to lower IOP to near-normal levels before cataract surgery, using either antiglaucoma medications or glaucoma surgery if necessary”, “Fortunately, most glaucoma patients respond well to medications”.

Response:

Thank you very much indeed for your comments.

We have added references to these sentences.

“Most ophthalmologists aim to lower IOP to near-normal levels before cataract surgery[5], using either antiglaucoma medications or glaucoma surgery if necessary” (Page 5, line 82)

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

2• The number of eyes involved in the study needed a statistically justified sample size calculation.

Response:

This was a pilot study. We did not calculate the sample size.

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

3. The inclusion of both eyes of the same patient in the study also needs statistical justification.

Response:

We use generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) for the incorporation of the correlation between the two eyes of the same participant.

We changed a sentence in statistical analysis (page 8, line135-139). “Generalized estimating equation (GEE) were performed for all comparisons, with statistical significance defined as a P value of less than 0.05.”

The results were the same after changing the method of statistical analysis. We have already revised the results in table 2.

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

4• In the abstract, the statement “IOL power showed a slight increase of 0.213±0.54 diopters (P=0.076)” is not accurate as p=0.006 in table 2.

Response:

We are sorry for the confusion.

We use generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) for the incorporation of the correlation between the two eyes of the same participant. So IOL power showed a slight increase of0.214±0.42 diopters (P=0.035).

We corrected them in abstract, text and table 2.

Page 3 line 57. Meanwhile, IOL power showed a slight increase of 0.214±0.42 diopters (P=0.035).

Page 10 line 158 (IOL power change, 0.214±0.377 D; P=0.035).

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

5• Figure 2 and its legend are not clear.

Response:

We decided to delete Figure2.

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

6• The control group mentioned at the end of the results has no place. If it is a case-control study, this should be considered in the methodology and the data of the control group should be presented in tables in comparison with the study group.

Response:

We deleted this paragraph as you recommend.

………………………………………………………………………………………………………

7• These statements in the discussion are not supported in the results: “more hyperopic shift in patients whose IOP was reduced by ≥8 mmHg” and “IOP drop exceeding 10 mmHg was found to correspond with a 0.5 diopter shift in IOL power”.

• The second part of the conclusion is not supported by the results.

Response:

We deleted “We noticed a trend toward a more hyperopic shift in patients whose IOP was reduced by ≥8 mmHg”

“IOP drop exceeding 10 mmHg was found to correspond with a 0.5 diopter shift in IOL power”.

• The second part of the conclusion is not supported by the results.

We explained more details in statistic analysis (page 8, line137-139) and results (page 10 , line 160-164)

Page 8, line137-139

“The correlation between the IOP and IOL change was analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was employed to determine the threshold of IOP change that impacts IOL power.”

Page 10, line 160-163

“Pearson analysis revealed a moderate correlation (r2=0.267) between the change in IOL power and the change in IOP (Fig 1). An area under the curve of 0.905 (95% CI: 0.79-1.00) indicated a significant cut-off point between a reduction in IOP greater than 10 mmHg and a shift in IOL power of 0.5 diopters. The association of the IOP over 10 and the IOL power change (0.5 diopter) was significant. (p < 0.001) The odd ratio was 27.0 (2.5, 291.2).”
