Abstract

Background

Numerous taxonomic studies have focused on the dung beetle genus Helictopleurus d’Orbigny, 1915, endemic to Madagascar. However, this genus stilll needs a thorough revision. Semantic technologies, such as nanopublications, hold the potential to enhance taxonomy by transforming how data are published and analysed. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of nanopublications in establishing synonyms within the genus Helictopleurus.

New information

In this study, we identify four new synonyms within Helictopleurus: H.rudicollis (Fairmaire, 1898) = H.hypocrita Balthasar, 1941 syn. nov.; H.vadoni Lebis, 1960 = H.perpunctatus Balthasar, 1963 syn. nov.; H.halffteri Balthasar, 1964 = H.dorbignyi Montreuil, 2005 syn. nov.; H.clouei (Harold, 1869) = H.gibbicollis (Fairmaire, 1895) syn. nov. Helictopleurus may have a significantly larger number of synonyms than currently known, indicating potentially inaccurate estimates about its recent extinction.

We also publish the newly-established synonyms as nanopublications, which are machine-readable data snippets accessible online. Additionally, we explore the utility of nanopublications in taxonomy and demonstrate their practical use with an example query for data extraction.

The dung beetle genus Helictopleurus d’Orbigny, 1915, which comprises 71 species (Montreuil 2005a), is endemic to Madagascar. It is mostly found in wet forests in the eastern part of the island, with a few species occurring in the drier western regions. Many Helictopleurus species are known solely from unique type specimens collected in poorly-sampled localities (e.g. H.ambiguus Paulian & Cambefort, 1991, H.villiersi Paulian & Cambefort, 1984 and H.minutus Paulian & Cambefort, 1984). In contrast, certain species have been described from localities that were intensively sampled at the beginning of the 20th century, but have not been rediscovered since their description.

A recent revision of the Helictopleurusfungicola species-group (Rossini et al. 2021) has uncovered an instance of synonymy: H.fungicola (Fairmaire, 1899) = H.pluristriatus d'Orbigny, 1915. This discovery hinted at the possibility of further unrecognised synonyms within the genus, prompting us to conduct an additional examination of the type material.

The potential underestimation of synonyms in Helictopleurus suggests that future research could further reduce the number of recognised species in the genus. Consequently, the reported extinction of 50% of Helictopleurus species during the 20th century (Hanski et al. 2007), which was attributed to deforestation, may not actually represent a genuine extinction phenomenon. Instead, it could be indicative of understudied taxonomy in the genus, where many species names might be synonyms. We address this issue in the discussion below.

We use nanopublications to share our results regarding the synonymies. A nanopublication represents a minimal unit of scientifically meaningful information that can be used to describe virtually anything (Kuhn and Dumontier 2017, Kuhn et al. 2021). It is written in a RDF (Resource Description Framework) format that computers can interpret. Through a decentralised network of services, nanopublications make the established synonyms instantly available online, adhering to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). This method of sharing information ensures that research findings are accessible to anyone, even to those who have not read the paper. In the subsequent sections, we discuss the utility of nanopublications for taxonomic nomenclature and provide an example query.

Materials and methods

The studied specimens are deposited in the following institutes:

NMPC: Národní National Museum, Prague, Czech Republic;

MNHN: Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle, Paris, France;

MZH: Finnish Museum of Natural History (LUOMUS), Helsinki, Finland;

Label data of the examined type specimens is provided in Darwin Core (DwC) format. We investigated only the genitalia of the type specimens whose identity could not be determined using external morphology alone. Specimens were photographed using a Canon EOS 5D Mark III and a Canon MP-E 65mm 2,8 1-5x macro lens. Images were edited in Adobe Photoshop. We used TaxonWorks to manage and retrieve the taxonomic history of the taxa treated in this study. The species distribution maps were generated in QGIS by assembling occurrence data from FinBIF (Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility), type and non-type specimens from the MNHN and NMPC. FinBIF data were retrieved in R, using the FinBIF package (Morris 2024). A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for Madagascar was automatically generated with the OpenTopography DEM Downloader plugin as implemented in QGIS. Many of the collecting localities were georeferenced according to Viette (1991). Species occurrence data are provided in DwC format as a supplementary file (Suppl. material 1). Before including the data into the maps, the identity of the specimens was confirmed by morphological study and comparison with the types.

Creating and querying nanopublications

The nanopublications were generated using the nanodash service, offered by Knowledge Pixels. Due to a collaborative effort between Pensoft Publishers and Knowledge Pixels, this service is accessible through the Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ) portal. It enables the creation of nanopublications that can be seamlessly integrated with conventional publications for release in BDJ, a process we utilised in this research.

Nanopublications can be queried using the endpoints at https://query.np.trustyuri.net. The exemplary SPARQL query, which is designed to retrieve all synonyms along with their corresponding valid names, is available via this link and the Supplementary Material (Suppl. material 2) (Fig. 1).

This query uses a SPARQL endpoint provided by Knowledge Pixels to select synonyms created using the nanodash service. Specifically, it searches for nanopublications of the type OrganismTaxonToOrganismTaxonAssociation.

Diagnosis

Within the semivirens group, H.halffteri may be related to H.seminiger. Males can be distinguished by the clypeal tubercle simple (laterally connected to two ridges in H.seminiger) and the frontoclypeal carina trituberculate (simple in H.seminiger). No female specimens of H.seminiger are known, as the type series includes the male lectotype only (see "Taxon discussion" below).

Distribution

Antsianaka and Lac Alaotra (Fig. 3d).

Taxon discussion

The Helictopleurussemivirens species-group includes 10 species: H.aeneoniger Lebis, 1960, H.cambeforti Montreuil, 2005, H.halffteri Balthasar, 1964, H.heidiae Montreuil, 2007, H.niger d’Orbigny, 1915, H.pseudoniger Montreuil, 2005, H.seminiger d’Orbigny, 1915, H.semivirens d’Orbigny, 1915, H.steineri Paulian & Cambefort, 1991 and H.tamatavensis Montreuil, 2005 (Montreuil 2005a).

Helictopleurushalffteri shares exclusive phenotypic traits with the members of the group, such as head ogival-shaped and elongated (unique within Helictopleurus); head of male often with clypeal tubercles, frontoclypeal carina and frontal tubercles and/or curved carina; dorsal side of the body very polished, fairly dark, dull to feebly shining; elytra visibly longer than pronotum with respect to the majority of Helictopleurus species.

Balthasar (1964) described H.halffteri on a single female specimen collected by the Perrot brothers in 1893 in Antsianaka and, after its description, the species name appeared only in one checklist (Montreuil 2005a). On studying the Helictopleurus of the semivirens group, Montreuil (2005a) discovered that the type series of H.seminiger, which allegedly consisted of one male and one female specimen, included instead two distinct species. Actually, the specimen that d’Orbigny (1915) identified as female turned out to be a male and was designated by Montreuil (2005a) as the holotype of the new H.dorbignyi. Therefore, the type series of H.seminiger currently consists of a unique male designated as the lectotype (Montreuil 2005a).

The type series of H.dorbignyi is composed of the male holotype collected in Antsianaka, lake Alaotra and multiple male and female paratypes collected further south, in the Ranomafana National Park and nearby localities (Fianarantsoa) (Fig. 3d). On studying the external morphology and genitalia of the type specimens of H.dorbignyi deposited in the MNHN, we realised that the type series is composed of at least two distinct species: one represented by the male holotype alone; the other represented by several males and females collected in Ranomafana. Therefore, in the light of the abovementioned facts and after examination of the holotype of H.halffteri, we conclude that:

(i) the morphology of the female holotype of H.halffteri and its type locality suggest that this specimen is conspecific with the male holotype of H.dorbignyi. Thus, H.dorbignyi is established as junior subjective synonym of H.halffteri (H.dorbignyi syn. nov.).

(ii) The study of the female genitalia of H.halffteri and female paratypes of H.dorbignyi collected in Ranomafana indicates that they belong to different species. Therefore, a new Helictopleurus species from Ranomafana is waiting formal description.

Interestingly, the unique type specimen of H.seminiger was collected from Antsianaka – which is the same type locality as H.halffteri – and the species has never been recollected since 1892. These circumstances would make the identity of this taxon questionable. However, during our visit to the Paris museum, we could not study the genitalia of the lectotype of H.seminiger. Possibly, the differences observed on the cephalic processes between H.seminiger and H.halffteri represent a simple variation of a same species. An extensive review of the semivirens group would help to sort out unresolved questions that still hamper the correct identification of these cryptic taxa.

Diagnosis

Helictopleurusrudicollis belongs to the rudicollis group and can be readily distinguished from other members of the group, H.rubricollis and H.cribricollis, by the pronotum and elytra metallic-green and shiny and elytra with lighter spots (elytra dark, dull, not metallic and without spots in both H.rubricollis and H.cribricollis). The separation of H.rudicollis from H.splendidus is still unclear, as the male of the latter was never described. Nonetheless, the following female characters could help in separating the two species: punctation of posterior third of pronotum evenly distributed in H.rudicollis (sparser in H.splendidus); lateral pronotal angles more expanded laterally in H.splendidus; median tubercle of frontal carina simple in H.rudicollis (bilobate in H.splendidus).

Distribution

This species is widely distributed across eastern Madagascar, from the Sambava to Ifanadiana District (Fig. 3a).

Taxon discussion

Balthasar (1941) described H.hypocrita on a unique specimen, but no exact collecting locality was given. Without checking the holotype, Lebis (1960) assigned this species to the giganteus group, suggesting that the original description could refer either to H.undatus (Olivier, 1789) or H.rudicollis. Ever since, H.hypocrita appeared only in one checklist (Montreuil 2005a). In this study, we investigated and compared the external and genital morphology of the holotype of H.hypocrita with the type specimens of the members of the rudicollis group and we eventually concluded that H.hypocrita is a junior subjective synonym of H.rudicollis (H.hypocrita syn. nov.).

The Helictopleurusrudicollis group includes four species (Lebis 1960, Montreuil 2005b): H.rudicollis, H.cribricollis Lebis, 1960, H.rubricollis Lebis, 1960 and H.splendidus d’Orbigny, 1915. However, after examination of the syntypes of H.furcicornis Lebis, 1960, we deem that this species too could be considered an additional member of the same group. Helictopleurusfurcicornis shares several characters with H.rudicollis: body metallic-green; elytra with a series of orange-brownish spots; long yellow setae along the lateral edges of the pronotum; tip of the parameres strongly curved downwards. However, the two species differ in the shape of the male frontal horn (conical in H.rudicollis; wider, with parallel sides and distally emarginated in H.furcicornis), pronotal punctuation (denser in H.rudicollis) and lighter spots on elytra (single transversal row in H.rudicoliis; elytral interval 4 with two additional spots, one in proximity of the base, one close to the apex).

Helictopleurusrudicollis was described from Tamatave and Antsianaka, which correspond to today’s Toamasina and Lac Alaotra, respectively, both located in central-eastern Madagascar (Viette 1991). Instead, the type series of H.splendidus includes specimens from Bémarivo (probably referring to a locality along the Bemarivo River, north-eastern Madagascar), Fianarantsoa and Fort Dauphin (central-eastern and south-eastern Madagascar, respectively) (d’Orbigny 1915) (Fig. 3a). Despite the multiple dung beetle surveys carried out over the last 20 years in the type and nearby localities, no additional specimens of H.splendidus have been captured or identified. On the other hand though, H.rudicollis is considered one of the most abundant species in these localities (Rahagalala et al. 2009). Therefore, given that the two species are morphologically very similar, the above statements raise a series of questions that need further investigation: (i) Have all the "H.rudicollis" specimens collected so far been identified correctly? (ii) is H.splendidus a valid species? (iii) If so, maybe this latter species has become extinct?

During a recent collecting expedition in Madagascar (February 2022), we collected a series of conspecific specimens in Mandraka Park (-18.914266, 47.92477098), Analamazoatra (-18.939524, 48.418760) and Mantadia (-18.84549399, 48.42834902) National Parks, including one male, that may belong to H.splendidus. However, a detailed comparison of the morphology of these specimens with the types of H.splendidus and H.rudicollis is needed to confirm this identification and the taxonomic status of H.splendidus.

Diagnosis

Helictopleurusvadoni is readily distinguished from congeneric species by the following combination of characters: elytra dark, with metallic tinges and characteristic brownish-orange spots mostly concentrated on the basal half of the intervals 1–5; elytral intervals with erected setae; pronotum metallic-green, shiny, densely and evenly punctated and setose, discal punctures coarser.

Distribution

This species occurs in the Sambava and Maroantsetra Districts, north-eastern Madagascar (Fig. 3c).

Taxon discussion

Helictopleurusperpunctatus was described on two female specimens, without exact collecting locality. According to Balthasar (1963), the holotype is in J. Schulze’s collection (probably in the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin), but we could not examine it. In this study, instead, we investigated the morphology of the paratype (NMPC), which clearly indicates that H.perpunctatus is a female of H.vadoni. Given the original description and Balthasar's expertise on scarabs, we believe that both the holotype and paratype are conspecific. Therefore, H.perpunctatus is established as the junior subjective synonym of H.vadoni (H.perpunctatus syn. nov.).

Balthasar (1963) states that his conclusions on H.perpunctatus was drawn after consultation of the keys from d’Orbigny (1915). Therefore, it is likely that he overlooked the Helictopleurus that meanwhile were described by Lebis (1960). In so doing, Balthasar considers H.perpunctatus a close relative of H.infimus (Fairmaire, 1901) and provides a list of characters to separate the two species.

Lebis (1960) included H.vadoni in the fungicola-viridiflavus group, along with seven additional species. These Helictopleurus were subsequently separated into two groups: fungicola and viridiflavus (Montreuil 2005a). Today, the viridiflavus group comprises the following species (Montreuil 2005b): H.viridiflavus (Fairmaire, 1898), H.vadoni, H.infimus (Fairmaire, 1901), H.carbonarius Lebis, 1960, H.minutus Paulian & Cambefort, 1984, H.villiersi Paulian & Cambefort, 1984 and H.ambiguus Paulian & Cambefort, 1991. The majority of these Helictopleurus seems to be strictly associated with dry and semi-arid regions of western Madagascar. The dung beetle fauna of these areas has been poorly investigated and many of these Helictopleurus are only known from the type series, which often consist of single specimens.

Helictopleurusvadoni and H.viridiflavus are the only members of the group that occur in the humid-most eastern Madagascar, with occasional incursions into drier regions (Fig. 3c). Helictopleurusviridiflavus is a very distinct species, with elytra brownish and without spots; pronotum metallic-green to coppery, with elongate and very dense punctures.

Diagnosis

Helictopleurusclouei is distinguished from other members of the H.quadripunctatus group by the pronotum metallic-green and shining (opaque, dark green to bluish in the other species); elytra orange to dark brown (black with a medial yellow stripe in H.perrieri), with poorly-defined dark spots at the base and apex (spots more distinct in H.quadripunctatus). Harold (1869) suggests that H.clouei may be related to H.quadripunctatus, but specimens of H.clouei are visibly smaller.

Distribution

This species occurs in northern Madagascar and is relatively common in open habitat (Fig. 3b).

Taxon discussion

According to Harold (1869), the original description of H.clouei was allegedly based on a single female specimen without exact type locality. In the present study, the examination of this unique syntype allowed us to confirm that it is actually a male. This species is today assigned to the quadripunctatus group, together with H.quadripunctatus (Olivier, 1789), H.perrieri (Fairmaire, 1898) and H.gibbicollis (Fairmaire, 1895) (Lebis 1960, Montreuil 2005a).

Amongst the numerous Helictopleurus authored by L. M. H. Fairmaire (1820–1906), in 1895, he described H.gibbicollis from a single male specimen collected by C. A. Alluaud (1861–1949) in Diego Suarez (Fairmaire 1895). This species was originally assigned to the semivirens group (Lebis 1960) and later moved to the quadripunctatus group (Montreuil 2005a). Despite Fairmaire’s explicit statement about the collecting event, it is still unclear why Lebis (1960) and Paulian (1986) indicate "Mandritsara" as type locality of the species.

Over the years and despite the intense dung beetle surveys carried out in Diego Suarez and surroundings (e.g. Hanski et al. (2007)), H.gibbicollis has never been recollected nor mentioned in any work. This makes the taxonomic identity of this species fairly questionable and in urgent need of validation.

The morphological examination of the syntypes of H.clouei and H.gibbicollis allowed us to establish the latter as a junior subjective synonym of H.clouei (H.gibbicollis syn. nov.). Probably, the different colour of the elytra of the two specimens (dark brown in the syntype of H.gibbicollis and bright orange in H.clouei) might have confused former authors, who kept considering H.clouei and H.gibbicollis as distinct species. However, the shape of the cephalic ornaments (carinas and frontal horn) and pronotum, the pronotal tegument, the colour pattern of elytra and the shape of the parameres clearly indicate that the two specimens are conspecific.

This new synonymy reduces the number of species of the quadripunctatus group to three.

Discussion

Helictopleurus: recent extinction or undiscovered synonyms?

The latest catalogue of Helictopleurus includes 60 species (Montreuil 2005a). Since then, new taxa have been described, bringing the total count of species and subspecies to 71 (e.g. Montreuil 2005b, Montreuil 2007, Montreuil 2011, Montreuil 2012, Rossini et al. 2021). Many Helictopleurus species were originally described from specimens collected in the early 20th century and have not been recollected since. Notably, a significant dung beetle sampling intiative during 2002–2006 (Hanski et al. 2007) managed to collect only 29 species, representing approximately 50% of the known diversity at that time. Based on these findings, Hanski et al. (2007) suggested that the absent species might have become extinct, likely due to the widespread deforestation in Madagascar driven by human activities.

Contrasting this view, our prior and current study (Rossini et al. 2021) may indicate that species loss in Helictopleurus may not be as severe as previously thought. The loss of pristine forest is unquestionably one of the major threat to Madagascan biodiversity (Morelli et al. 2019, Antonelli et al. 2022). Nonetheless, the current trends in Helictopleurus also suggest that a number of currently-accepted species names might actually be undiscovered synonyms. Thus, the loss of 50% species diversity, attributed to extinction as proposed by Hanski et al. (2007) should be reassessed after an extensive taxonomic review of Helictopleurus. This casts a more optimistic light on the conservation status of Helictopleurus species in Madagascar and underscores the importance of thorough taxonomic studies in understanding biodiversity and extinction rates.

Nanopublications and Taxonomy

We created the nanopublications in the nanodash platform and integrated them into this article using the ARPHA writing tool provided by Pensoft. Each of our nanopublications contains a statement like "species name X is a subjective synonym (obo:NOMEN_0000285) of species name Y, published by M. Rossini, based on this article". The identifiers for the species names are supplied by ChecklistBank. Nanopublications are written using RDF language (akin to XML) by utilising terms from established ontologies and vocabularies (Kuhn et al. 2021). As a framework for graph-based data representation on the web, RDF allows modelling of complex semantic structures, ensuring that nanopublications can be understood by computers (Dimitrova et al. 2021, Giachelle et al. 2021). Due to this flexibility, nanopublications can be used to convey a wide range of scientific information besides synonymy (see the nanodash platform for details).

Upon creation in nanodash, nanopublications are instantly accessible via a decentralised network maintained by Knowledge Pixels, which makes them available to anyone with internet access. It is important to note that nanopublications are not peer-reviewed upon creation. This approach facilitates the rapid sharing of biological data, but it also raises significant concerns within the community about the potential contamination with low-quality data. Notably, the nanodash platform distinctly labels nanopublications as either peer-reviewed or non-peer-reviewed, enabling their straightforward separation. We therefore believe that nanopublications do not seem to pose a threat to data quality or to flooding the informational landscape with undesirable content. Nevertheless, this topic requires further discussion within the scientific community.

Peer-reviewed nanopublications are directly linked to their corresponding papers, facilitating their citation. Therefore, integration of nanopublications with taxonomy shows great potential to enhance the citation and acknowledgment of taxonomic studies (Mons et al. 2011, Patterson et al. 2014). To illustrate the practical application of the nanopublications, we provided an exemplar SPARQL query. It retrieves all synonyms along with their valid names and associated metadata. SPARQL, the standard query language for Linked Open Data on the web or RDF datastores, allows constructing complex queries for various types of data.

Nanopublications streamline the traditionally labour-intensive process of updating and accessing taxonomic information. In the conventional approach, researchers must diligently surf through relevant taxonomic papers to keep data up-to-date, a task that is both time-consuming and demanding. Similarly, major data aggregators, such as GBIF or the Catalogue of Life, face challenges in extracting information from traditional publications, often relying on manual processing or use of semi-supervised tools. Besides requiring additional effort, this also leads to delays in making the new data available after they are published. Nanopublications address these challenges by making taxonomic data immediately accessible and queryable online.

There is an ongoing initiative to link nanopublications with ZooBank (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), aiming to make taxonomic and nomenclatural information swiftly available and broadly accessible to researchers. This integration could significantly accelerate the dissemination of taxonomic knowledge across various domains of science. Generally, nanopublications hold great promise for enhancing efficiency and reducing the time and effort required in managing taxonomic data.
