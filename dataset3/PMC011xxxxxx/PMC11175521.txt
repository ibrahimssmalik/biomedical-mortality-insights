The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans [Bsal] is causing declines in the amphibian populations. After a decade of mapping the pathogen in Europe, where it is causing dramatic outbreaks, and North America, where its arrival would affect to the salamander’s biodiversity hotspot, little is known about its current status in Asia, from presumably is native. Japan has several species considered as potential carriers, but no regulation is implemented against Bsal spreading. Previous Bsal known presence detected various cases on the Okinawa Island, southwestern Japan. Previous studies on its sister species, B. dendrobatidis presented a high genomic variation in this area and particularly on Cynops ensicauda. Here, we have done the largest monitoring to date in Japan on the Cynops genus, focusing on Okinawa Island and updating its distribution and providing more information to unravel the still unknown origin of Bsal. Interestingly, we have provided revealing facts about different detectability depending on the used molecular techniques and changes in its Japanese distribution. All in all, the Bsal presence in Japan, together with its low variability in the sequenced amplicons, and the lack of apparent mortalities, may indicate that this part of Asia has a high diversity of chytrids.

pmcIntroduction

Chytridiomycosis, caused by the chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [Bd] and B. salamandrivorans [Bsal], is an amphibian disease that has resulted in population declines in many parts of the world [1]. Bsal has particularly affected salamanders and newts in Western Europe by infecting their skin and causing lethal lesions [2]. Bsal has affected both wild and captive populations, leading to a near extinction of the wild populations of fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, in the Netherlands. It has caused a severe decline of the fire salamander in Belgium and Germany as well as an outbreak affecting Triturus marmoratus in NE Spain due to an illegal release of allochthonous species that affected local species as well [3–5].

The introduction of this fungal pathogen to Europe is primarily attributed to the pet salamander trade from East/Southeast Asia [6] and therefore, trade regulations have been established [7]. It is imperative to control the amphibian pet trade and conduct surveillance of the pathogen to prevent its spread to Bsal free regions [8].

Pursuing this need, the monitoring of Bsal in its the allegedly native distribution becomes primordial in order to know the ecological needs and the suitable areas where the human-mediated spreading could facilitate outbreaks caused by the arrival of Bsal. Primarily, Bsal-positive localities were found and thought to be part of the native distribution in South Korea, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan, suggesting an Asian origin of Bsal [6, 9].

Since the description of Bsal, monitoring efforts have been focused on Europe where massive screenings were carried out [3, 10]. Nevertheless, Asia has been subject to substantially less Bsal sampling, excluding Vietnam [6], China [11] and Taiwan [12].

Despite several localities with molecular confirmation for this chytrid fungus, since 2014 Bsal monitoring has not been performed in Japan. Thirteen specimens of four different species tested positive [9]. Regarding the other chytrid fungus species, Bd, Japan, and particularly the Ryukyu Islands, have been shown to have a high genetic diversity. As an example, [13] obtained 44 haplotypes of Bd ITS‐DNA in Japan. Besides, the sword-tailed newts Cynops ensicauda from Okinawa Island, the main island of the Ryukyu Islands had both the highest infectious incidence and the greatest number of haplotypes. Remarkably, in both Okinawa Island and Amami Island the same species were Bsal positive [9].

Interestingly, to date, all the genomic data available belongs to the same isolate, and amplicons for Bsal positive samples were compared with these available sequences with not observed difference [9, 11]. Unfortunately, no further research has been done in any of the alleged Bsal native countries in order to assess for genetic variation, amplicon diversity, nor Bsal distribution.

Thus, in this research we present the biggest monitoring carried to date in Japan, where we have explored the genetic diversity of the Bsal positive animals in order to check if the same kind of variation as in Bd exist, which we have also included in our analysis, and we have checked thoroughly the alleged Bsal positives localities reported in the one and only study that included Japan, focusing on the hotspot of Bd, the Okinawa Island.

Materials and methods

Between 2011 and 2023, a total of 1012 samples were collected from various sources for the purpose of detecting Bsal or unrelated sample collection. These samples were obtained from 98 sites, encompassing 21 amphibian species from Japan [See S1 Table]. We collected samples from 34 out of 43 prefectures of Japan, spanning across seven different islands. More than 50% of the samples belong to Japanese amphibians from the genus Cynops [C. ensicauda and C. pyrrhogaster]. Both were extensively sampled due to its known suitability as hosts for Bsal chytrid fungi [9].

Most of the samples consisted of skin swabs [Men-tip 1P1501, Nihon-Menbo Co.] collected using standard procedures for sampling amphibian chytrid fungi, while a small portion consisted of toe clippings [14]. When possible, and without compromising relevant data, swab samples from the same locality and same amphibian species were pooled in order to reduce costs with a maximum number of four swabs pooled for one extraction [15].

Genomic DNA was extracted from both kind of samples, swabs and toe clips, using a slightly modified protocol [see 10] for the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit [Qiagen, Hilden, Germany] and Bsal testing was conducted in the facilities of University of the Ryukyus. Two detection assays were utilized: one based on standard polymerase chain reaction [PCR] followed by electrophoresis [2] and the other on duplex Bd and Bsal quantitative PCR [16]. Positive or equivocal results on the standard PCR were reanalyzed using duplex quantitative PCR [qPCR]. Quantification standards were created from gBlocks [Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA, USA] as Bsal and Bd standards. In qPCR tests, all analyses were performed in duplicate in Roche LightCycler 480 II [Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan], using the Roche 480 Probes Master mix [Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan]. A sample was considered positive only if both wells amplified, the increase in fluorescence showed a standard sigmoidal curve, and the Ct value was below 40. Samples with single well amplification were retested. In all analyses, we used the calculation of the 2nd derivative maximum, which is available in LightCycler 480 software. Subsequently, a subset of samples was sequenced by chain-terminating [Sanger] in Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer [Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA] targeting the 5.8S rRNA gene. This study was approved by the University of the Ryukyus Animal Experimentation Committee [approval number A2022053].

Results

This study confirmed the presence of Bsal in Japan. Within the Japanese geographic range where it was detected, neither deaths nor animals with symptoms compatible with chytridiomycosis were observed.

Quantitative PCR [qPCR] analysis detected 17 samples of which at least one well became qPCR Bsal positive. According to the criteria mentioned in the Methods section, only four samples should be considered qPCR positive from two localities, but same species Cynops ensicauda popei, from Okinawa Island [see Table 1]. These four samples were checked again by qPCR and consistently showed a positive signal in both wells with permanent values around 1 GE load. In addition, we performed Sanger sequencing in all the doubtful samples, and we were successful in 13 of them. All sequenced samples (160 base pairs) showed a 100% identity with GenBank accession number KC762295. From the 13 sequences, 10 of them are from different localities, and two of them are coincident with previously published Bsal localities [9]. In the case of Bd, samples that were doubtful by standard PCR method were analyzed using the duplex Bd-Bsal qPCR. Here, Bd was detected in 32 samples [see Table 1]. One locality showed 55% of prevalence, but as in the rest of Bd positive samples, the GE load was always less than 10 GE.

Discussion

We have detected Bsal in Japan after 10 years of no information since the one and only study [9] containing data about the Bsal presence in Japan was published. In spite of the sampling effort for this work being four times larger, the epidemiologic situation seems analogous to [9]. The prevalence and the infection loads found, were similar to [9] and two out of the ten positive localities detected in this study correspond with already published positive localities. This evidence could suggest a long-term relationship among host and pathogen and most likely endemism of Bsal for at least Okinawa Island. The confirmed presence of the pathogen for more than a decade, the lack of individuals with high infection loads, and a low prevalence without detected outbreaks, respond better to an endemic situation in a relationship between host and pathogen. If we keep in mind the situation and how was the arrival of Bsal into the European urodelan populations, it does not show the same interactions of a novel pathogen into its potential hosts as it happened in Central Europe. On the other hand, one locality in Okinawa Island, where Bsal was detected in 2014 [9], had no presence of newts despite several visits at different times of the year. Even when Bsal is known to be able to extirpate entire populations [3], we presumed that in this case it is related with human-mediated major habitat destruction of the surroundings, that left the area heavily altered and isolated.

Interestingly, our repeated analysis of samples by different methodologies presents an intriguing result. Bsal qPCR protocol has been under discussion and considered not enough to claim a sample for being Bsal positive [17]. Thus, in summary, the qPCR Bsal protocol was said to tend to create false positives. In contrast, we have observed that in 10 samples where we initially discarded the interpretation of qPCR results as Bsal positive, posterior standard PCR amplification in a different room where qPCR analyses were carried out, produced several amplicons with sequences 100% identical to the Bsal reference accession number KC762295.

As stated above, we have been very conservative in the establishment of criteria for assuming the positivity in our samples. If we would have followed the criteria of [18], for example, another five positives could be mentioned, meaning that from all repeated analysis more qPCR analyses were positive than negatives. On the other hand, we could have followed even a more conservative approach if we had confirmed the Bsal positive samples in two laboratories. Although qPCR is an established, reliable, and robust technique, and amplicons were identical to the published B. salamandrivorans sequence, the low-level infections in the Japanese amphibians preclude the use of an independent diagnostic technique as required by the World Organisation for Animal Health, hampering the possibility to exclude false positive results.

Another fact to point out is the Bsal presence in Hokkaido Island. In the past, two Salamandrella keyserlingii individuals out of four were found Bsal positive [9]. We increased the effort by ten times in this island and extended the monitoring to the only other caudate species found in the island, Hynobius retardatus, with one individual testing positive and being the first Bsal positive for this species. It is an intriguing situation that in a species with a high prevalence in the past [50% but a small sample size, see 9] Bsal was now not detected in this species. Hokkaido climate is known by its harsh winters, e.g., average temperature is below 0º C for 4 months, and this could have pushed Bsal to undetectable levels during the time of our monitoring. On the other hand, this detected/undetected situation has already occurred in other areas where previous known Bsal presence was detected and on different climate areas, e.g., Spain and Taiwan [see 12, 19]. However, its detection in Hynobius retardatus but not in Salamandrella keyserlingii is interesting, especially when this species was thought to be resistant to the fungus [9].

Unlike in its suggested sister species, Bd, we have not observed genetic variation in the Bsal sequenced amplicons in Okinawa [neither other part of Japan], a known hotspot for Bd haplotype variation [13]. A reasonable interpretation of this fact could be that the origin, or the evolutionary history, of both pathogens is different, meaning that Bsal presence in this area is at least more recent (or even could indicate an invasion event) than Bd or even artificially introduced. This suggestion is supported through evidence from sequences obtained from the rest of Japan share the same haplotype as those from Okinawa. Nonetheless, we are aware that the sequencing of a short fragment from the ITS region falls short for a firm interpretation, and additional methodologies such as Bsal strain typing would be recommended to infer sound conclusions.

Lastly, it is important to mention that, currently, Japanese conservation laws do not protect all amphibian species equally. For example, Cynops pyrrhogaster and C. ensicauda popei, in particular, are widely and frequently captured in the wild for commercial, research, and educational purposes. Furthermore, these species are easily and legally [as there is no regulation for this species] found in stores, private collections, or high schools [20]. It is crucial to implement mitigation measures to prevent further spread of this deadly pathogen and protect amphibian populations as its presence in the international pet market is noteworthy [20, 21].

Conclusions

Our study confirms the presence of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in Japan, suggesting that this fungus may have a longer history in this region in comparison other Asian countries where recurrent detection has not been achieved, and in addition, it is not causing obvious mass mortalities as it does in other parts of the world. The low pathogen load detected could be explained by the result of a long-term relationship between pathogen and host. However, similar relationships have been already found in Europe (e.g. Ichtyosaura alpestris [22]) even though Bsal does not show any sign of being native to Europe. Strong statements should be avoided with the current available information. The found prevalence existing in our monitoring, 1.6%, is slightly lower (but not significantly lower) than in other studies in Bsal presumably native countries [e.g., China, 2.9% and Vietnam, 2.9%, see 6, 11]. Until further phylogenetic analyses confirm its origin, the Bsal presence in Japanese territory may have been introduced by humans, being endemic to Southeast/East Asia or even circulate undetected in this geographic range without causing deaths as well. These results should raise awareness among the research and conservation communities and prompt urgent action to identify regions with early emergence of the disease and implement mitigation measures to prevent further spread of this deadly pathogen.

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: This is an interesting study in the field of Bsal research, which is a dangerous amphibian pathogen in certain parts of the world, so far especially Europe. As Asia is considered the origin of Bsal, this study is an important contribution bringing to light novel knowledge. The “story” is sound, the introduction leads to the purpose of the paper and the methods are standard methods. Results are well described and convincing. The discussion refers to the significant points and emphasizes the importance of the finding in a critical view.

I like the paper and will be happy to see it published in PLoS ONE. I made some comments, see below, which might help the authors to improve their paper.

However, before acceptance, in many parts, the language is awkward. Maybe look for a native speaker to make corrections.

Title, line 1: I find the title a bit tough, as Bsal is not always a killer, especially not in Japan. I recommend to change the title to simply use the term “salamander chytrid fungus”

Introduction, line 53: Maybe rewrite as “in many parts of the world” instead of worldwide.

Line 59-63: True but a bit out of focus of the paper, I suggest to be more brief here.

Line 66 f: Emphasize here that this study and others (e.g. 6, 11, 12) have suggested already that Bsal is of Asian origin.

Line 84f. You should state here that also Bd was in your focus, as you studied both (mentioned in line 109).

Methods, line 94: delete “different” – 22 species, by definition, are different.

Results, line 128f.: Although important this I part of the method and was mentioned there already (line 114f.). Do not repeat method here. Move details to method section and rewrite.

Line 145f.: Add the reference number to the citation of Bloii et al. and Spitzen-van der Sluijs et al.

Discussion, line 164: “This evidence suggests a long-term relationship among host and pathogen…” Explain this a bit better.

Line 171f: “Bsal qPCR protocol was under discussion and considered not enough to claim a sample for being Bsal positive [17]. Thus, in summary. the qPCR Bsal protocol was said to tend to create false positives.” This likewise needs a better explanation for the reader.

Line 177: Yes, I agree you followed a “conservative” approach but still samples were not studied in different labs, which sometimes is considered a critical aspect, as well. Please consider to include this into the discussion here.

Line 193: Say “suggested sister species”.

Reviewer #2: Summary

This paper presents data on the prevalence of the fungal pathogen Bsal (and its congener Bd) in samples collected from multiple Japanese islands (as well as 2 samples from Myanmar). The authors find a low prevalence of Bsal-positive samples (comparable to that in other surveys in East and Southeast Asia), but some inconsistencies in detection between different diagnostic methods. In my opinion, the most useful contributions from this paper are the establishment of new Bsal localities in East Asia, some associated sequence data, and the detection in a species with no previous record of Bsal.

Major concerns

The paper is in need of substantial English-language editing throughout. The meaning of the text is often clear, but there are key passages where it is not, and key terms are not clearly defined. For example, it is hard to tell what species is being referred to in the description of the outbreak in NE Spain (Line 57)

There are a few places where I think the conclusions and interpretations don’t seem to be in line with the data. For example, the suggestion that “this part of Asia is the chytrid hotspot” in the abstract doesn’t seem consistent with their results and interpretations, but it is hard to tell if this is a language issue or an interpretation problem. Also, I think the authors should be more cautious about interpretations related to long-term endemism based on the limited data they provide.

The organization of the Introduction could be much clearer, including both the flow of ideas within paragraphs and the relationships between paragraphs. For example, there is a rather abrupt transition from Bsal to Bd on line 74, and there is a series of very short paragraphs between lines 59 and 71 that seem too small to stand on their own and don’t really flow together very well.

It would be good to have more discussion of why they got disparate results using different detection methods.

Specific comments

Line 54: Are the lesions themselves lethal? Or are they a symptom associated with severe disease, which causes death through other mechanisms?

Lines 56-58: Rewrite sentence for clarity.

Lines 59-63: Good points, but are not very clearly connected to the surrounding material in the Introduction, and may be less relevant for this particular study.

Lines 80-82: Meaning not clear

Line 95: The Introduction focuses on Japan, so I was a little bit surprised to see that there were samples from Myanmar as well. I didn’t see these mentioned anywhere else in the paper.

Line 117: Unclear what the 2nd derivative maximum was used for.

Table 1: Would be good to have the total number of samples per island listed somewhere

Line 162: I’m not sure why sampling effort would be related to infection load

Lines 164-165: Not clear how the data suggests long-term relationship and endemism.

Lines 170-180: The discussion of different diagnostic techniques seems useful. Would be good to flesh this out more, including adding more information about the differences in sensitivity between the assays used here and other approaches.

Line 186-188: Do we know that harsh winters decrease probability of detecting Bsal? Presumably the hosts are in habitats that are not quite so cold?

Lines 191-192: I agree that it is interesting and useful to expand the list of species on which Bsal has been detected.

Line 191-205: nice paragraph

Lines 210-211: I don’t think the current paper has enough data to support this point, and I’m not sure I agree with the logic (eg, there can be species in the introduced range that also tend to have low Bsal loads).

Lines 214-216: This sentence doesn’t seem to fit very well

Map figure: would be useful if this showed all sampled localities (not just the Bsal-positive ones)

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: (No Response)

Reviewer #3: The authors describe an extensive sampling of amphibians throughout Japan for chytrid fungi. Results are largely confirmatory of previous studies (eg Goka et al., 2009; Martel et al., 2014) but are sufficiently interesting to warrant publication. While in general, the study is fine, I would recommend addressing several issues:

Major concerns:

I only have one major concern and that is that sequencing a short (how much bp? Please mention) part of the ITS of the chytrid fungus B. salamandrivorans is not sufficient to make any inference about diversity. I am not sure whether I understood correctly, but sequences would all be 100% identical (and identical to the available sequence). The authors really should refrain from drawing any conclusions with regard to diversity / phylogeny based on these results. At most, the sequencing confirms that a short B. salamandrivorans ITS sequence is present in their samples. Hence, conclusions with regard to “origin”, “hotspot” or any inference with regard to epidemiology (eg recent colonization) must not be drawn. Such statements should be omitted from title, abstract and discussion, unless the authors would have performed additional analyses that do warrant conclusions with regard to B. salamandrivorans strain typing (eg strain isolation and sequencing).

Minor concerns:

1) There is an odd mentioning of two samples from Myanmar. It is difficult to understand how this fits the story. Suggestion to omit from this paper (does not really add anything useful). Also, if the authors would prefer to leave these samples in, please provide all permits (incl Nagoya protocol) from Myanmar to demonstrate legal original (+ correct the name in S1 to Tylototriton). However, there does not appear to be any sound, scientific rationale to include these two samples.

2) Results need revision; the table 1 is confusing and at the same time does not provide sufficient information. For example, the difference between the second and third column is unclear. The total number of sampled localities per island + the number of samples (pooled or not) examined should be summarized here. The same for the legend of S Table, which is equally difficult to understand. E.g. the legend states “detected by Blooi et al…”, where I guess the authors mean “detected by qPCR (according to Blooi et al.).

3) It is difficult to track any data that refer to prevalence or infection load. The authors used pooled and simple samples. This is ok, but pooling samples requires any conclusion to prevalence and infection loads to be nuanced (eg prevalence then is at pool level).

4) There is one issue where I would love to see an additional sentence and that is the potential of false positives (which includes the possibility of another organism with the same (short) ITS sequence). According to WOAH, diagnosis of B. salamandrivorans infection requires the use of two independent techniques (eg culturing or histopathology). Sequencing amplicons from a positive PCR is not considered an independent technique. I would like to stress this is not meant to disregard the authors’ results. I fully realize it is very difficult, if not impossible, to use an additional technique (culturing, histopathology), especially in low level infected populations. However, if not performed, it is impossible to discard the possibility of false positives (which has been the case in Europe, see eg Thomas et al. and which remains unexplained). I would therefore recommend to add a sentence along these lines: “Although qPCR is an established, reliable and robust technique and amplicons were identical to the published B. salamandrivorans sequence, the low level infections in the Japanese amphibians preclude the use of an independent diagnostic technique as required by the WOAH, hampering the possibility to exclude false positive results.”

Reviewer #1: (No Response)

Reviewer #3: Concerns have been addressed sufficiently. I commend the authors for their extensive study and have no further concerns.

Reviewer #4: The title is inaccurate. Their is no phylogenetic analysis in this paper or comparative measures of genetic diversity. A more appropriate title could be: 'An updated distribution of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in Japan’.

L41. It's prevalence - not incidence. And it is not high - it is actually very low compared to outbreak areas in Europe.

L48. 'Low variability' is a relative term. What are you comparing against? Epidemiologically speaking, low diversity indicates an invasion event (limited temporal time allowed for genetic diversity to accrue). So your data more accurately represents a recent invasion.

L108. What is the evidence that the metabarcoding marker that you have chosen has any phylogenetic resolution? O'Hanlon et al. has shown very clearly (see Supp Info tanglegram plots) that ITS-2 has no phylogenetic resolution for Bd.

L131. Sanger sequencing of what locus?

L223. This is a hypothesis. For instance in Europe only Salamandra is highly susceptible. Other species of newt tolerate infection or are resistant to infection.

Reviewer #1: (No Response)

Reviewer #4: I still think the title is inaccurate. Even if your aim is to contribute to the elucidation of the origin of Bsal, your data do not say anything about this, so to include ‘“Disentangling the origin” is confusing.

As you argue in your replay, the term of incidence is confusing, so please replace the the term ‘incidence’ in the abstract or use another term to avoid misunderstandings.

As you agree in your replay, a low diversity usually indicates an invasion event. Therefore, please discuss this point more in detail in the discussion.

Regarding the use of ITS-2, again, your data do not tell us anything about the origin of Bsal and are only valuable for the distribution of Bsal.

Regarding your conclusions, again I think your data are not informative to say ‘this fungus has a long history in this region’.

6. Review Comments to the Author

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters).

- Reviewer #1: (No Response)

- Reviewer #4: I still think the title is inaccurate. Even if your aim is to contribute to the elucidation of the origin of Bsal, your data do not say anything about this, so to include ‘“Disentangling the origin” is confusing.

- DLG: The title has been modified as you suggested: Lack of variations in the salamander chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, at its alleged origin: Updating its Japanese distribution with new evidence.

- As you argue in your replay, the term of incidence is confusing, so please replace the the term ‘incidence’ in the abstract or use another term to avoid misunderstandings.

DLG: In order to avoid this, the term high incidence has been changed by various cases.

- As you agree in your replay, a low diversity usually indicates an invasion event. Therefore, please discuss this point more in detail in the discussion.

- DLG: We have added your suggestion (low diversity could indicate an invasion event). It has been done in the area where we had discussed this matter (Line 212 in the current version).

- Regarding the use of ITS-2, again, your data do not tell us anything about the origin of Bsal and are only valuable for the distribution of Bsal.

- DLG: We are trying to show here the contrast between Bd and Bsal. We know that Bd has a high variability when sequenced in Okinawa (see for more Goka et al 2009, 2021). On the other hand, we have not detected any variability in the sequences obtained from Bsal in Okinawa. This situation and lack of variability among Bsal sequences could be interpreted as a difference in the time that both pathogens have been present in Okinawa, and I hope that you interpret our data in the same way.

- Regarding your conclusions, again I think your data are not informative to say ‘this fungus has a long history in this region’.

Additionally, the sentence ‘The found prevalence existing in our monitoring, 1.6%, is lower than in other studies in presumably Bsal native countries’ is incorrect because a proportion of 11/650 (your study) is not significantly lower than 33/1143 (China) nor 17/583 (Vietnam; Z=1.572, p=0.1160; Z=1.44, p=0.1499; respectively).

- DLG: We have revised the Conclusion to address your points. Our results do not suggest, as you say, that this fungus has a long history in the area, but we have at least stated that it is highly compatible with that idea. For example, If you check all the studies that have been done about Bsal in Asia, (China, Vietnam, and Taiwan), you may notice that after the first detection carried out in these countries Bsal was not detected in the same localities or even to confirm the Bsal presence in the country was not possible again. However if you have any problem with this term, I will be more specific and being less assertive, rephrasing the sentence in this manner: “Our study confirms the presence of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in Japan, suggesting that this fungus may have a longer history in this region in comparison other Asian countries where recurrent detection has not been achieved, and in addition, it is not causing obvious mass mortalities as it does in other parts of the world”.

About the second part, the numbers of the prevalence, we have not mentioned any statistical term along the text. Your calculations are correct, but we are talking about the raw numbers, and we were not including the word significant, so our information about the prevalence is correct. In order to avoid any misleading information for the reader we have included between brackets “(But not significantly lower”) and “slightly” lower in the part that you have mentioned. Please see the text, line 238.
