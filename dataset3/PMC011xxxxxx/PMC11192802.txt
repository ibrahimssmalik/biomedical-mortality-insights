The aim of this study was to analyze signal loss (SL) resulting from low signal quality of pulse oximetry-derived hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements during prolonged hypoxemic episodes (pHE) in very preterm infants receiving automatic oxygen control (AOC). We did a post hoc analysis of a randomized crossover study of AOC, programmed to set FiO2 to “back-up FiO2” during SL. In 24 preterm infants (median (interquartile range)) gestational age 25.3 (24.6 to 25.6) weeks, recording time 12.7 h (12.2 to 13.6 h) per infant, we identified 76 pHEs (median duration 119 s (86 to 180 s)). In 50 (66%) pHEs, SL occurred for a median duration of 51 s (33 to 85 s) and at a median frequency of 2 (1 to 2) SL-periods per pHE. SpO2 before and after SL was similar (82% (76 to 88%) vs 82% (76 to 87%), p = 0.3)).

  Conclusion: SL is common during pHE and must hence be considered in AOC-algorithm designs. Administering a “backup FiO2” (which reflects FiO2-requirements during normoxemia) during SL may prolong pHE with SL.

  Trial registration: The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov under the registration no. NCT03785899. What is Known:

• Previous studies examined SpO2 signal loss (SL) during routine manual oxygen control being rare, but pronounced in lower SpO2 states.

• Oxygen titration during SL is unlikely to be beneficial as SpO2 may recover to a normoxic range.

	
What is New:

• Periods of low signal quality of SpO2 are common during pHEs and while supported with automated oxygen control (SPOC), FiO2 is set to a back-up value reflecting FiO2 requirements during normoxemia in response to SL, although SpO2 remained below target until signal recovery.

• FiO2 overshoots following pHEs were rare during AOC and occurred with a delayed onset; therefore, increased FiO2 during SL does not necessarily lead to overshoots.

pmcIntroduction

Pulse oximetry–derived hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) is standard of care in neonatal intensive care units for monitoring gas exchange and controlling oxygen titration. We conducted a study comparing two different algorithms of an automated oxygen controller (AOC, “SPOC” algorithm, Fritz Stephan Gmbh, Gackenbach, Germany) with routine manual control (RMC), also evaluating two different averaging times (2 s vs 8 s) [1]. In line with previous studies [3–7], we found an increased proportion of time spent in the predefined SpO2-target range during AOC and a reduction of hypoxemic episodes (HE) compared to RMC alone [1, 2]. As prolonged hypoxemic episodes (pHEs) were recently identified as the major physiologic predictor of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and death and are known to be associated with impaired long-term neurodevelopment, preterm infants might benefit from reduced exposure to pHEs [8, 9]. Interestingly in our study, for a median (range) of 5% (3 to 7%) of the time during 2-s SpO2 averaging and 1% (1 to 4%) during 8-s averaging, the signal quality was reduced in the controlling pulse oximetry signal (signal loss, SL) while infants received AOC with the current SPOC algorithm [1]. SL has been previously evaluated in a study conducted by Lim et al. where it was more common at low SpO2 values [10]. They suggested that blind FiO2 adjustments are not beneficial during SL. In line with this recommendation, all currently available AOC algorithms, to our knowledge, postpone automatic oxygen titrations during SL. Specific for the SPOC algorithm, the FiO2 is set to a pre-defined back-up value typically reflecting FiO2-requirements during normoxemia. When good signal quality resumes, automated FiO2 control is re-enabled according to the current SpO2. As these responses to SL may affect the performance of AOC during pHE, we aimed to investigate the occurrence of SL during pHE with the current SPOC algorithm.

The main objective of this analysis was to investigate the frequency and duration of SL as well as SpO2 before and after such periods. Secondary outcomes included timing and duration of desaturation and subsequent hyperoxemic “overshoots.”

Methods

This was a post hoc analysis of an unblinded randomized crossover study of SPOC [1]. In short, 24 preterm infants were analyzed with a GA < 34 weeks receiving respiratory support including supplemental oxygen. Patients were randomized to five different sequences (routine manual control (RMC), the new SPOC algorithm and the old SPOC algorithm, while SpO2 averaging time was set to 2 s or 8 s) with 6-h recordings at each averaging time—SPOC combination. The new algorithm differed from the old by enabling to set an upper limit for FiO2 (in our study set to 0.15 above baseline FiO2), faster decrements to above baseline FiO2 after normalization of SpO2 following an hypoxemic event and slower decrements to below baseline (see [1] for a detailed description). For this analysis, we evaluated the AOC periods with the current algorithm (SPOC new).

A bedside pulse oximeter (Radical7, Masimo SET, Irvine, USA) was used for controlling the SpO2 signal which fed its signal into the ventilator where the SPOC algorithm was implemented (Sophie, Fritz Stephan Gmbh, Gackenbach, Germany). The SPOC algorithm then adjusted the FiO2 according to the current SpO2. During SL, specifically the SPOC algorithm was programmed to set the current FiO2 to a preset backup value. In our study, back-up-FiO2 was set to follow “baseline FiO2” where the latter is a value that can be set manually, but is also updated every 5 min while AOC is enabled to asymptotically approximate the mean actual FiO2 of the preceding 15-min time interval. (which typically reflects FiO2 requirements during normoxemia). Therefore, in case of an increased FiO2-demand during a pHE, SL is resulting in a reduction of FiO2 due to being set back to the preset backup-value. As soon as the SpO2-signal resumed, SPOC would titrate FiO2 according to the current SpO2.

Episodes of pHE (episodes with SpO2 saturations < 80% for ≥ 30 s) and their duration (SpO2 dropping below 90% until returning to the target range (SpO2 at 90 to 95%) for at least 8 s) were analyzed for the presence of SL and their characteristics. We also evaluated differences in number and duration of SL between both averaging times (2 s vs 8 s). Hyperoxemic “overshoots” were defined as SpO2 ≥ 97% for a minimum of 8 s within 120 s after recovery of SpO2 to the target SpO2 range.

Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages, continuous variables using medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). For comparisons between SL groups (yes, no), the Mann–Whitney U test was used for continuous variables, and the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test (in case of small expected counts) was used for categorical variables. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 28, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). All tests were two-sided and a p value < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Demographic details have been published previously [1]. In short, 24 participants receiving non-invasive respiratory support including supplemental oxygen (median (IQR) gestational age at birth 25.3 weeks (24.6 to 25.6)) were evaluated. The duration of the evaluated recordings with new SPOC was 12.7 h (12.2 to 13.6 h) per infant in which we identified 76 pHEs with duration of 119 s (86 to 180 s) in 22 (92%) participants. In three (13%) participants, no SL occurred during pHEs, whereas in 19 (79%) participants, at least one SL period was identified within pHEs (13 (68%) were found to have pHEs with and without SL). In total, 102 episodes of SL occurred in 50 (66%) pHEs (See Fig. 1 for an example, Table 1 for details of pHEs). SpO2 before and after SL did not differ significantly (82% (76 to 88%) vs 82% (76 to 87%), p = 0.3). SpO2 after SL were either below (n = 90 (88%)), within (n = 11 (11%)) or above target (n = 1 (1%)).Fig. 1 Prolonged hypoxic episode example.

aFrom Mann–Whitney U test

When comparing the averaging times of 2 s vs 8 s, pHE with SL was more common during 2 s averaging (60% vs 40%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.770). The median duration of SL periods was 20 s (14 to 36 s) vs 32 s (12 to 52 s; p = 0.547).

Hyperoxemic overshoots occurred in 22 pHEs, of which six were due to manual override.

Discussion

In this post hoc analysis of prospectively recorded data, we showed that SL is common during pHEs. SL occurred in 2/3 of pHE-episodes and lasted for approximately 40% of the pHE-duration, compared to the previously reported proportion of total study time of 5% (3 to 7%) with SL during 2 s averaging and 1% (1 to 4%) with SL during 8 s averaging in the total study time [1]. Lim et al. reported that the proportion of SL time was increased in lower SpO2 ranges (< 85%) compared to higher SpO2 ranges (> 95%) [10]. We focused on even lower SpO2 values (< 80%). Comparing the different averaging times, we saw no significant difference in SL duration or its frequency of occurrence.

As periods of SL lead to a halt in automatic oxygen titration, our findings are relevant to the design of AOC algorithms in general. Specifically for the SPOC algorithm, FiO2 is reduced by falling back to the preset “back-up FiO2” which likely affects controller performance during the pHE. Under manual FiO2 control, Lim et al. suggested that blind FiO2 adjustments are unlikely to be of benefit, and the SpO2 reading for SL-episodes starting in hypoxia (SpO2 < 85%) returned at a median value that was 3.2% higher than at the start of SL [10]. According to our data in SL-episodes starting in hypoxemia, SpO2-readings returned to about the same SpO2 level thus were still in a rather hypoxic range. Of note, the recovery in SpO2 resulted in values below target in 90/102 SL-periods (88%), whereas SpO2 above target was identified in a single episode only (1/102 SL-episodes (1%)). Therefore, the vast majority of SL-episodes started and ended below target. We interpret this finding as indicating only a low risk of overshoot hyperoxemia in case FiO2 would have been higher during SL. We interpret this finding as indicative of a low risk of overshoot hyperoxia in case FiO2 would have been higher during SL. The time spent with SpO2 < 80% was significantly higher in pHEs with SL vs pHE without SL; furthermore, pHE duration was longer in case of SL. Even though our sample was smaller, it points to the fact that “blind” decrements in FiO2 to the backup-value due to the implemented SPOC algorithm potentially prolong HEs. We suggest that these automatic reductions in FiO2, by returning to a back-up FiO2 mostly influenced by normoxic periods during pHEs while SL occurs, are of questionable benefit. An adoption of the algorithm would mean to disable these automatic reductions in FiO2 during pHEs and would maintain increased FiO2 while the infant remains hypoxemic. Furthermore, even slight FiO2 increments might be considered during SL. This would potentially further shorten HE duration but might increase the risk of overshoot-hyperoxemia after recovery (although unlikely, considering that SpO2-readings returned to the hypoxic range).

Therefore, a prospective clinical evaluation of every adaptation of AOC-algorithms is mandatory.

Limitations

Being a post hoc analysis, validity of our study might be reduced. However, our analysis is based on objective parameters and prospectively recorded data. Generalizability is limited, as this was a single-center, small study that only included patients on non-invasive respiratory support.

Conclusion

SL during pHE is common and should be considered when designing an AOC algorithm. AOC, in our case SPOC, responding to SL by falling back to “back-up FiO2” might prolong the duration of pHE because SpO2 before and after SL did not differ in our study. With the SPOC-algorithm, overshoots after SL were uncommon and with delayed onset and, therefore, maintaining an increased FiO2 during SL in pHE might not increase overshoots.
