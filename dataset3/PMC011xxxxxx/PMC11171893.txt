==== Body
pmcIn the original publication [1], there was a mistake in “Figure 7. Impact of RSV on the Nrf2 signalling pathway in zearalenone-induced gut oxidative stress in mice”. The research images were duplicated due to carelessness in drawing the combined images, resulting in ZEA + 50 mg/kg RSV and ZEA + 200 mg/kg RSV being the same (Figure 7d). We have corrected Figure 7d on the basis that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. The corrected Figure 7 is as follows:

This correction has been approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated.

Figure 7 Impact of RSV on the Nrf2 signalling pathway in zearalenone-induced gut oxidative stress in mice. Indicators of oxidative stress (a) MDA, (b) T-SOD, and (c) CAT (n = 6). (d) Immunohistochemical analyses of Nrf2 (magnification: 100× and scale bar: 50 μm). Representative western blot images (e) and quantification of (f) HO-1 and (g) Nrf2 (n = 3). Relative expression of mRNA in the jejunum (h) NQO1, (i) GSH-PX, and (j) γ-GCS (n = 6). Values are presented as the mean ± SD of each treatment. “##” p < 0.01 compared to control group; “*” p < 0.05 and “**” p < 0.01 compared ZEA group.
