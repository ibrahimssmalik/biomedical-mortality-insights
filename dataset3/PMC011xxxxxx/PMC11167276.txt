pmc﻿Introduction

Erythroneurini is the largest tribe of Typhlocybinae (Yuan et al. 2014). Erythroneurine leafhoppers are rich in diversity and have a body length of less than 5 mm. There are approximately 2,000 species worldwide, which are difficult to identify (Song and Li 2014). They feed on the leaf parenchyma cell contents and can cause harm to agricultural crops and forest trees of economic importance (Lu et al. 2021).

The genus Empoascanara was established by Distant (1918) with Empoascanaraprima Distant, 1918 as its type species. Subsequently, other researchers have described many new species. There are currently 92 Empoascanara species known, most of which are found in the Australian, Afrotropical, and Oriental regions. The genus Motaga was established by Dworakowska (1979) with Motagarokfa Dworakowska, 1979 as its type species. Only five species are known, and the genus is currently known only from the Oriental region. The genus Tautoneura was established by Anufriev (1969) with Tautoneuratricolor Anufriev, 1969 as its type species. It contains 64 species, of which 22 were previously known from China until now.

As part of this work, some interesting erythroneurine leafhopper materials from karst areas of Southwestern China were collected. Following examination and comparison of these materials, four new species, Empoascanaraaparaoides Wang & Song, sp. nov., Motagamengyangensis Wang & Song, sp. nov., Motagaacicularis Wang & Song, sp. nov., and Tautoneuraqingxiuensis Wang & Song, sp. nov., were discovered, and these are described and illustrated in this paper.

﻿Materials and methods

Specimens were collected by sweeping-net method. Male genitalia and abdominal apodemes were dissected and cleared in a 10% NaOH solution. Morphological terminology used in this study follows Dietrich (2005) and Song and Li (2013). The specimens were observed and drawn under Olympus SZX16 and Olympus BX53 microscopes, respectively. A Keyence VHX-5000 digital microscope was used for photography. The length of erythroneurine leafhoppers was measured from the apex of the head to the tip of the folded forewing. All specimens examined are deposited in the collection of the School of Karst Science, Guizhou Normal University, China (GZNU).

Figs 25–28 , 29–36

Diagnosis.

The new species can be distinguished from other Motaga species by its extremely long and slender in lateral view aedeagal shaft, which has a pair of short basal processes that are not bifurcated at apex; the pygofer dorsal appendage, which tapers to the apex and is bent ventrad and hook-like apically; the connective with two long arms; the subgenital plate with four macrosetae; and the very small male abdominal apodemes.

Remarks.

This species closely resembles Tautoneuramaculosa Sohi, Mann & Shenhmar, 1987, but it can be distinguished by the absence of prominent, dark markings on head, pronotum, and mesonotum (present in T.maculosa), the subgenital plate bearing two macrosetae (vs three), and the much stouter aedeagus than in T.maculosa.

Etymology.

The new species is named after its type locality, Qingxiu Mountain.
