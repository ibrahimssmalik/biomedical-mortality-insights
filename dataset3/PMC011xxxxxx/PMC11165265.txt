Gymnostachyum Nees (Acanthaceae) is a genus consisting of about 30–50 species distributed mainly in tropical Asia (Hu et al. 2011; Deng 2014; Mabberley 2017; Deng et al. 2020; Manzitto-Tripp et al. 2022). The genus is characterized by a combination of two stamens and many seeds (Hansen 1985), absence of staminodes, ovary with 3-several ovules per locule, capsule cylindrical, and seeds compressed, covered with hygroscopic hairs (Lindau 1895). It belongs to tribe Andrographideae (Lindau 1895; Scotland 1992; Scotland and Vollesen 2000; McDade et al. 2008), however Somprasong et al. (2015) placed Gymnostachyum under subtribe Andrographinae. In Peninsular Malaysia, Clarke (1908) recognized eleven species of Gymnostachyum, including ten new species, while Ridley (1923) recorded Gymnostachyum with 13 species (including four doubtful species) and described a new species Gymnostachyumhirtum Ridl. from Perak (Ridley 1926). Tan et al. (2014) described Gymnostachyumkanthanense Kiew from a limestone hill, Gunung Kanthan, Perak.

The discovery of this distinctive new species is part of the comprehensive survey of the Peninsular Malaysia limestone flora in 2017. The species was found on the limestone hills in Federal Land and Development Authority (FELDA) Chiku and Perasu in Kelantan, and is endemic in Kelantan. The species inhabits partially shaded areas, and roots in cracks with thin soil layer on rocks at the base to the summit of karst limestone. After carefully examining the herbarium specimens and living material and reviewing the relevant literature, here we concluded that the newly discovered plants represented an undescribed species. Herewith, the new species is described and illustrated in detail.

﻿Materials and methods

Measurements and morphological character assessments of the new species were undertaken and described using specimens collected from their natural habitat and living materials grown in the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) Biodiversity Nursery. Photographs of the habit and all parts of the plants were made and botanical line drawings of floral and fruiting parts were prepared. Materials collected were deposited at the herbarium of Forest Research Institute Malaysia (KEP) and the flowers were preserved into the spirit collection in Copenhagen mixture. The available Gymnostachyum specimens from other herbaria such as BK, BKF, CAL, KLU, SING, UKMB and PSU were examined (herbarium acronyms follow Thiers 2024, continuously updated). In addition, images of the type specimens of Gymnostachyum were obtained from JSTOR Global Plants (http://plants.jstor.org) and Tropicos (http://www.tropicos.org). The provisional conservation assessment is based on the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria Version 3.1 (IUCN 2012) and guidelines of the IUCN (2022).

Diagnosis.

Unique among Peninsular Malaysian species of Gymnostachyum by having a racemose inflorescences occasionally lower axils with pairs of flowers and dichasium inflorescence with opposite branches. Gymnostachyumcalcicola shows affinity with Gymnostachyumdecurrensvar.decurrens and var. robinsonii by its crowded rosette leaves at the base, however it is different in the inflorescences type.

Flowers suberect. Calyx divided near the base, lobes 5, equal, narrowly linear, 2–3 × 0.5–1 mm long, green, hairy outside, clasping the corolla tube. Corolla white outside, inside white with scattered minute purple spots except for the deep purple lower lip, deep purple at the median lobe, minutely glandular hairy outside, ca. 12–14 mm long, narrowly cylindric at base, tube 10 × 1 mm, expanding distally to funnel-shaped throat, upper lip erect, ca. 3 mm long, apex slightly bilobed, flat, lower lip unequal, the middle lobe much shorter. Stamens 2, filaments white, 6–7 mm long, inserted at the base of the throat, glabrous, anthers purple-white, inserted, positioned below the apex of upper lip, narrowly oblong, ca. 2 mm long, thecae 2, equal, both with minute mucronate appendages at base, densely covered with short stalked glandular hairs with dense white hairs along longitudinal line of dehiscence; staminodes absent. Nectary annular, cream-coloured, ca. 1 mm high, upper margin entire. Ovary green, cylindric, 1–1.5 mm long, densely covered in short glandular hairs, ovules many per locule; style white, up to 8 mm long, sparsely hairy, stigma hooked, less than 1 mm long, positioned between the anthers. Capsule narrowly cylindric, 10–12 × 1–2 mm, retinacula 6–7 per locule, calyx persisting after the fruit has fallen. Seeds up to 12 (probably more), obliquely ovoid, strongly compressed, ca. 1 mm longitudinal, surface minutely pitted, hairy.

Distribution and habitat.

Endemic to Kelantan, Peninsular Malaysia; known only from limestone hills. Species grows in small populations, always observed in shaded areas, rooting in cracks on thin soil on limestone rocks, almost to the summit of the hill.

Etymology.

The specific epithet refers to the limestone habitat of this species.

Provisional IUCN regional conservation status.

Endangered B2 ab(i,ii,iii). Most Chiku limestone hills were visited, but only two to three hills were home to this new species. A part of Chiku limestone hills is scheduled for quarries. The survival of the species remains uncertain. The species also has been recorded in Perasu limestone hills, about 40 km away from Chiku hills. Parts of FELDA Perasu limestone have been quarried, and surrounding areas are currently disturbed by the road constructions. All hills lie outside the network of Protected Areas.

Notes.

Ridley (1923) divided the Peninsular Malaysian species into two groups: (i) dwarf plants with single flower of long inflorescences and; (ii) shrubby plants with elongate stem. This new species falls into the first group (Table 1) together with GymnostachyumdecurrensStapfvar.decurrens and var. robinsonii (Ridl.) J.B. Imlay, G.diversifolium C.B.Clarke, G.pallens C.B.Clarke, G.kanthanense, and doubtful species recorded for Peninsular Malaysia, G.ceylanicum Arn. & Nees. The new species shows affinity with Gymnostachyumdecurrensvar.decurrens and var. robinsonii by its crowded rosette leaves at the base and its racemose and spicate inflorescences and G.pallens from its branched peduncle. It differs from the other species by not having a winged petiole and in having racemose inflorescences, occasionally lower axils with pairs of flowers and dichasium inflorescence with opposite branches.
