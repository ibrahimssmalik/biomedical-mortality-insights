==== Body
pmcThe Sensors Editorial Office retracts the article, “TRUST: A Novel Framework for Vehicle Trajectory Recovery from Urban-Scale Videos” [1], cited above.

Following publication, concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding the overlap between this article [1] and an earlier thesis published in another language [2], authored by an unconnected academic.
