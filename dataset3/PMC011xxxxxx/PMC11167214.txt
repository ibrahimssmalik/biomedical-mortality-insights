pmcThis article has been corrected as follows:

Figure 6 was mistakenly included twice as both Figure 6 and Figure 7. Figure 7 has been replaced with the correct image. The legend for Figure 7 was updated to read: The elemental mapping data of whitlockite synthesized using the coprecipitation method: (A) a mixture of all the elements, (B) calcium, (C) phosphate, (D) magnesium, (E) oxygen, and (F) carbon.
