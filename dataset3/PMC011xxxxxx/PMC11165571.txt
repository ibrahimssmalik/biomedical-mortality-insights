Herein, the execution of synthetic strategies solving scalability issues observed in the original route is reported, increasing the total yield by 50% compared to the previously disclosed synthesis. A notable restructuring of the route’s initial steps to reach a common allylic alcohol intermediate employs a highly stereoselective epoxidation method and avoids superfluous protecting group manipulations while limiting dependence on kinetic resolution in establishing stereochemistry for four of the six chiral centers in (+)-desmethylxestospongin B. Different protecting group strategies to avoid problems with their subsequent removal were considered and enacted; to this end, material was retained as byproducts were suppressed. While the lactam semireduction under Birch conditions requires further investigation, the updated synthesis of (+)-desmethylxestospongin B reported here made it more scalable, affording 0.37 g of this natural product for continued biological studies.

pmcIntroduction

(+)-Desmethylxestospongin B (dmXe B) is a marine natural product, holding attention for its structural complexity and bioactivity. Xestospongin and araguspongine compounds were isolated from species Xestospongia exigua and structurally identified to be composed of two bis-1-oxaquinolizidine heterocycles bound by two equivalent hexamethylene chains.1−3 Variations in the structure of these compounds include C2 symmetry or lack thereof as well as the presence or absence of C9 and/or C9′ hydroxylation. Some of these xestospongin compounds—notably, dmXe B—were observed to affect mitochondrial respiration by blocking inositol triphosphate receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to cellular autophagy and allowing selective tumor cell apoptosis. This phenomenon has been observed in treating MDA-MB-231 cell lines with increasing concentrations of dmXe B against normal MCF10A cells.4,5 While the promise of targeted cancer treatments remains attractive, the natural source of dmXe B has been depleted while biological studies are still ongoing. Our lab has developed and reported a 22-step total synthesis for this compound in 2021.5

The syntheses of other xestospongin compounds were executed by other groups. Hoye et al.’s synthesis6 of (+)-xestospongin A and Baldwin et al.’s synthesis7 of (+)-araguspongine B and (−)-xestospongin A both approach C2-symmetrical targets lacking C9/9′ hydroxylation through dimerization strategies, which has proven highly effective in the production of these targets. In Baldwin et al.’s case, the syntheses of enantiomers of the naturally produced xestospongins were crucial in the assignment of absolute stereochemistry. An original route was required in the synthesis of an asymmetric, C9/9′ hydroxylated xestospongin (as is dmXe B), so it could be produced from simple starting materials.5 The strategy enacted previously in our group (shown in Scheme 1) involves ring closure of the bis-1-oxaquinolizidine heterocycles immediately following partial reduction of δ-lactam in 2 to a hemiaminal intermediate and then hydrogenation to give the saturated hexamethylene fragments. In functionalizing fragments 3 and 4 independently, the desired macrolactam is assembled in a stepwise manner, leaving no room for homodimerization in the formation of a bis-lactam intermediate, followed by ring closure of the primary amide intermediate to δ-lactams in 2, occurring upon exposure to LiN(SiMe3)2. In the case of acid 3 and amine 4, the established stereochemistry and functionalization at C9 and C9′ is established by separate Ireland-Claisen rearrangement reactions, their conditions determined by the α-substitution of the corresponding allylic ester substrates 5 and 6. In the case of 4, the rearrangement is followed by esterification and azide reduction to amine to allow for the stepwise formation of the two crucial amide bonds in 2. These individual allylic esters 5 and 6 are derived from esterification of azido alcohol 7 with two different acid fragments, and 7 itself is synthesized through a coupling reaction between chiral epoxide 9 and alkyl iodide 8 by the use of a higher-order cuprate. Intermediate 8 itself is given by methylenation and alcohol protection of chiral epoxide 9, which is furnished through an epoxidation of 10 with MCPBA followed by kinetic resolution.5

Scheme 1 Original Synthetic Path to dmXe B

While the original synthesis remains effective in achieving a nonsymmetric functionalization present in dmXe B, a few outstanding questions remained following the initial completion of the route. Solving these problems would substantially improve the route, its efficiency, and its scalability and ultimately provide larger amounts of this biologically remarkable target compound. Roughly half the material in making chiral epoxide 9 (which is used twice in the synthesis to establish stereochemistry for four centers at C2, C2′, C9, and C9′ on the two oxaquinolizidine heterocycles) had to be discarded after kinetic resolution with Jacobsen’s catalyst. Reducing dependence on this material could be achieved with an asymmetric transformation to establish at least two of the four aforementioned stereocenters. The first 12 steps of the synthesis showed some material inefficiency, furthered by the superfluous alcohol protection to access alkyl iodide 8, as the para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group would need to be removed a mere four steps after its introduction in a 22-step synthesis. Introduction of the PMB group was difficult as conversion would not reach completion and the substrate had to be resubmitted to the reaction; a new approach that could avoid the requirement of this protection/deprotection sequence would certainly improve the productivity of these initial steps. On a separate note, methyl ester hydrolysis in 4 to access the intermediate for macrolactamization was accompanied by removal of the silyl-protecting groups. This desilylated byproduct was observed upon the rapidly applied acidic workup conditions required in order to avoid the formation of the six-membered lactone byproduct, which could form under the basic conditions of the hydrolysis. Finally, the Birch reduction of the δ-lactam units showed a 54% yield of the desired product, as well as an 11% yield of the α-dehydroxylation to the araguspongine B (Ar B) precursor. The reaction requires further improvement to suppress this α-dehydroxylation.

Results and Discussion

To answer these outstanding questions regarding the scalability of this important target, several modifications were proposed and executed in an updated synthesis. The original route was significantly adjusted in the first 12 steps to improve efficiency. To this end, an novel asymmetric epoxidation method is applied to establish the stereocenter in terminal epoxide 15 and subsequently allylic alcohol 16 (Scheme 2), which is to be translated to C9 and C9′ stereochemistry and functionalization; this further reduces dependence on the production of epoxide 9. In this manner, the inessential and cumbersome PMB protection to give 8 is no longer required. To prevent early-stage desilylation with the acidic workup conditions applied after methyl ester hydrolysis, this challenging intermediate is replaced instead with an allyl ester, as the mild conditions for its cleavage would not affect the silyl ether groups. Finally, in a hypothesis to reduce α-dehydroxylation in the Birch reduction, the benzyl ether, which gives the C9 hydroxyl group, is changed from Bn to PMB so the ether is first cleaved selectively, with DDQ and not concurrently, to the reduction step. Having the free hydroxyl group at C9 was hypothesized to suppress loss of this functional group as the rate of α-dehydroxylation was expected to be slower than α-debenzyloxylation.

Scheme 2 Improved Synthesis of Key Azido Alcohol 7

The modified synthesis begins with 3,4-buten-1-ol (11), which is distributed to prepare 4-bromo-1,2-butene (which will be converted to Grignard reagent 12) as well as (S)-2-(2-chloroethyl)oxirane (9), as depicted in Scheme 2. The chiral epoxide is generated by the same sequence as in the original synthesis. Chlorodehydroxylation of the substrate with thionyl chloride, followed by epoxidation with MCPBA, and then kinetic resolution using Jacobsen’s catalyst to provide the chiral epoxide 9 in 31% yield over three steps and 87% ee. Once Grignard reagent 12 is prepared from 4-bromo-1,2-butene, it is immediately submitted to reaction with 9 using a catalytic amount of copper(I) cyanide.8 In the adjustment to include the copper-catalyzed Grignard addition to the chiral epoxide in the synthesis, the reaction yielded pure material in its crude state, allowing purification to be postponed until after the subsequent silylation of the resulting alcohol. Furthermore, the reaction remained robust without any byproducts observed even with increasing concentration from 0.18 to 0.5 M, quantitatively processing reactions up to 17 g with reduced amounts of solvent, reliably providing the alcohol product in quantitative yields. Scales and concentration exceeding 17 g and 0.5 M, respectively, can still be explored. After the product alcohol is silylated, the crude product is purified through a silica plug, giving 100% yield of 13 over these two steps.

Following the synthesis of olefin 13, asymmetric epoxidation is employed to increase material efficiency in establishing stereochemistry for two out of four centers set by the kinetic resolution used in the initial synthesis of dmXe B. While numerous and reliable methods to perform asymmetric epoxidations exist, there were few options to allow the transformation to take place on terminal alkenes such as 13 or its alcohol precursor. Initial attempts at remote stereocontrol with desilylated 13 using conditions such as VO(acac)2/t-BuOOH proved unproductive, with minimal conversion observed. Attention was turned toward Berkessel et al.’s unique work, in which asymmetric epoxidations could be carried out on simple terminal alkenes through the in situ preparation of a catalyst formed from titanium isopropoxide and salalen ligand 14.9 In preparation for incorporating this work into the synthetic route, it was decided to perform this asymmetric epoxidation on 13 instead of its alcohol precursor, as the epoxide generated from the unprotected alcohol was observed to undergo intramolecular etherification to form a tetrahydropyran byproduct when purified on silica gel. Material up to 140 g was submitted through this asymmetric epoxidation to give a 93% yield. Not only that but also the newly employed asymmetric epoxidation method afforded the product with 15.7:1 dr, compared with the 24:1 dr observed in the original route, effectively matching stereocontrol from the original route with a more straightforward, high-yielding method. Methylenation of the epoxide by use of an ylide prepared from trimethylsulfonium iodide and n-butyllithium, which is followed by azide substitution of the chloride, gave allylic alcohol 7. In modifying the front end of the synthesis, the yield of this key common intermediate 7 was increased from 14 to 31% from 10 as compared to the original route and the number of steps was reduced by two. Having successfully constructed intermediate 7, this compound is then distributed to synthesize the two acid fragments 22 and 23 (Scheme 3). Compound 5 was prepared through the esterification of 7 with 5-chloropentanoyl chloride. Ester 21 was constructed through the synthesis of carboxylic acid 20, prepared by substitution of 1-bromoacetic acid with p-methoxybenzyl alcohol, and then direct alkylation with 1-chloro-2-iodopropane, which is then submitted to esterification with intermediate 7, eventually providing the hydroxylation at C9 of dmXe B.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Allylic Esters and Subsequent Ireland-Claisen Rearrangements

Allylic esters 21 and 5 are then submitted to Ireland-Claisen rearrangement conditions. Ester 5 is submitted to this rearrangement under standard conditions using lithium diisopropylamine. Through this rearrangement, preference for the (E)-enolate gives predictable stereochemistry favoring the desired diastereomer 23 with a 7:1 dr.

With 21, the Ireland-Claisen rearrangement was accomplished with KN(SiMe3)2 in toluene, which provided optimal conditions for the corresponding transition on the α-substituted allylic ester substrate. Previous work demonstrated that the rearrangement of α-alkoxy-substituted allylic esters under such conditions gives preference for the (Z)-enolate, resulting from potassium chelation to the silyl ketene acetal intermediate,10 affording the product acid 22 at an excellent 14:1 dr.

Acid 23 undergoes allylation, followed by azide reduction to provide amine 24 (Scheme 4). It should be noted that the conditions for the azide reduction were slightly adjusted from what was previously reported5 in reducing the presence of thiophenol from 6 to 4.5 equiv, as reported in literature.11,12 This modification circumvented the previously observed thiophenol substitution of chloride in 24. Furthermore, the concentration of the reaction was increased from 0.1 M (to the substrate) to 1.0 M, in order to prevent the overconcentration of crude material given by the previous procedure, which required acetonitrile removal in vacuo before aqueous workup could quench the reducing agent. At higher reaction concentrations, the solution could be diluted in methylene chloride and submitted to aqueous workup immediately. With these procedural adjustments in place, the initial temperature for the addition of azide substrate was lowered from 21 to 0 °C to counteract the exothermic reaction at the increased concentration. In this rendition of the azide reduction with tin(II) chloride, quantitative yields were achieved without any unwanted byproducts observed from the previous procedure.

Scheme 4 Fragment Convergence; Macrolactamization

With carboxylic acid 22 and amine 24 in hand, amide coupling to advanced intermediate 25 is performed. Following the purification of amide 25, the azide is reduced using the same tin(II) chloride conditions, as previously employed in constructing 24. The acid is liberated cleanly with the removal of the allyl group using phenylsilane and palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine). This method avoided drastic changes in pH, as was the case with the methyl ester intermediate of the original route. Then, the macrolactamization takes place under high dilution in 31% yield to enable the formation of a 24-membered ring in bis(lactam) 27.

The first six-membered rings comprising the two functionalized bis-oxaquinolizidine heterocycles are formed in an intramolecular N-substitution of the amide with the chloride, mediated by LiN(SiMe3)2. This reaction demanded great care as epimerization at the C9′ position will take place under the strongly basic environment. Incremental addition of LiN(SiMe3)2 in THF to the substrate solution was therefore required, titrating the reaction to completion. Thus, epimerization was minimized with the minor amount of byproduct readily removed by column chromatography, providing 28 as a single diastereomer (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of dmXe B

Following this ring closure, desilylation of 28 is accomplished in this stage in preparation for the final construction of the bis-oxaquinolizidine heterocycles. After removal of the PMB group (85% yield over two steps), compound 29 is subjected to Birch reduction conditions. Careful direction was required for this reaction, as simply following that of the original synthesis led to an incomplete reaction with only one of the bis-oxaquinolizidine rings formed. In efforts to drive the reaction to completion, the reaction required extension of the reaction time (30 min instead of 15 min) at a higher temperature (−45 °C instead of −78 °C). Upon completion of this step, α-dehydroxylation was unfortunately observed (Scheme 6), as well as epimerization, giving precursors to (+)-araguspongine B and (+)-xestospongin D, respectively, with the majority of the material corresponding to the precursor to dmXe B. These results were likely due to the extended reaction time required for the Birch reduction. Following the final submission of the mixture to hydrogenation with rhodium on alumina, the mixture was separated into its pure components by using reverse-phase column chromatography, affording 0.37 g (45% yield over two steps) of dmXe B.

Scheme 6 Proposed Pathway for α-Deoxygenation

Conclusions

In summary, a successful synthesis of dmXe B was completed, with several modifications enhancing scalability issues, enabling resumption of biological studies on this natural product. With these adjustments in place, the yield of the common intermediate 7 (following the modified beginning of the synthesis) was increased more than twofold, decreasing dependence on chiral material obtained by kinetic resolution. The use of an allyl ester increased the total yield by avoiding premature desilylation prior to macrolactamization. However, α-dehydroxylation at C9 was observed at a higher ratio with the free hydroxyl group at C9 compared to the benzyl ether in the same position from the previous synthesis, which indicates that further studies are required to improve the Birch reduction step of this synthesis. Nevertheless, the completion of this project saw achievement of the primary goal, as the overall yield of dmXe B (from 10) improved by about 50% from 2.2% to 3.3% in 20 steps.14

4-Chloro-1,2-butene (10)

To freshly distilled 3,4-buten-1-ol (0.214 kg, 3.0 mol), freshly distilled pyridine (17 mL, 0.21 mol, 0.07 equiv) was added. The mixture was cooled to 0 °C before thionyl chloride (0.217 kg, 3.0 mol, 1.0 equiv) was added dropwise. After 0.5 h, the mixture was warmed to 21 °C and assembled a reflux condenser, distillation head, and collection flask over the reaction flask, and then the temperature was increased to 85 °C using an oil bath. 1H NMR monitoring indicated complete conversion after 2 h. The collected product was combined with the crude material, and distillation was performed at 95 °C. The distilled product was washed with a saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution and dried with Na2SO4 to give 4-chloro-1,2-butene (0.231 kg, 2.6 mol, 86% yield) as a clear, colorless oil. 1H and 13C NMR spectral data matched those reported in the literature.13

2-(2-Chloroethyl)oxirane

To a solution of 10 (0.225 kg, 2.5 mol) in 0.60 L of CH2Cl2 cooled to 0 °C, 75% MCPBA in H2O (0.628 kg, 2.7 mol, 1.1 equiv) was added in six portions. The temperature was allowed to reach but not exceed 15 °C. The reaction was monitored by 1H NMR; complete conversion was observed after 12 h. The reaction mixture was filtered and then placed in a −20 °C freezer overnight, filtered again, and cooled to 0 °C; then, Me2S (0.237 L, 3.2 mol, 1.3 equiv) was added and the temperature was increased to 21 °C. The presence of peroxides was checked by combining a 0.2 mL solution with 0.2 mL of AcOH and 20 mg of KI, confirming that peroxides were quenched. Removed CH2Cl2 was removed by distillation at 65 °C under atmospheric pressure (heating via an oil bath), and then distilled epoxide product was distilled under vacuum (35 mmHg) at 85 °C with the collection flask in a −78 °C cold bath (vapor temperature observed between 68 and 70 °C), providing 2-(2-chloroethyl)oxirane (0.214 kg, 81% yield) as a clear, colorless oil. 1H and 13C NMR spectral data matched those reported in the literature.5

(S)-2-(2-Chloroethyl)oxirane (9)

Freshly distilled 2-(2-chloroethyl)oxirane (59.7 g, 0.56 mol) was added to (S,S)-(salen)Co(II) (1.69 g, 2.80 mmol, 0.005 equiv) under an inert atmosphere, followed by 5.6 mL of THF and then acetic acid (0.32 mL, 5.6 mmol, 0.01 equiv). The mixture was cooled to 0 °C; then, DI H2O (5.6 mL, 0.31 mol, 0.55 equiv) was added dropwise to the reaction. The temperature was maintained for 20 min before warming to 21 °C. Monitoring by 1H NMR showed 52% conversion to diol after 96 h. All volatiles were collected by vacuum distillation at 0.2 mmHg at 70 °C (using an oil bath, increasing the temperature up to 95 °C to collect diol) in a vessel cooled to −78 °C. Next, they were dried over Na2SO4 (rinsing with CH2Cl2), and then rinses were combined with the crude product mixture. Distilled under atmospheric pressure to remove CH2Cl2 and THF, the remaining crude product mixture was then distilled under vacuum (35 mmHg) at 85 °C to isolate (S)-2-(2-chloroethyl)oxirane (26.4 g, 0.25 mol, 44% yield) into a flask cooled to −78 °C (vapor temperature observed between 50 and 52 °C). 1H and 13C NMR spectral data matched those reported in the literature.5

(S)-5-Chloropent-1-en-3-ol

A solution of Me3SI (67.2 mg. 0.33 mmol, 3.5 equiv) in 0.20 mL of THF was cooled to −30 °C before 2.1 M n-BuLi (0.15 mL, 0.32 mmol, 3.4 equiv) was added dropwise. After 0.5 h, the temperature was increased to −10 °C and (S)-2-(2-chloroethyl)oxirane (9.4 mg, 0.088 mmol) was added in solution with 0.25 mL of THF. The reaction was allowed to warm to ambient temperature over the course of 1 h, and then conditions were maintained for 1 h. When the reaction was complete by thin-layer chromatography, the sample was cooled to 0 °C and added to 1 mL of saturated NH4Cl(aq) solution, followed by washing with 5 mL of brine and extraction with 5 mL of Et2O, drying with MgSO4, filtration, and then concentration in vacuo (with the bath set to 0 °C to prevent product evaporation). The crude product was submitted to the next reaction in its crude state.

(S)-1-(((5-Chloropent-1-en-3-yl)oxy)methyl)-4-methoxybenzene

To a solution of p-anisaldehyde (16 μL, 0.13 mmol, 1.5 equiv) in 0.60 mL of CH2Cl2, BF3·OEt (17 μL, 0.13 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added dropwise at −40 °C and then the crude substrate (S)-5-chloropent-1-en-3-ol (0.088 mmol) in solution with 0.24 mL of CH2Cl2 was added dropwise to the reaction, followed by Et3SiH (50 μL, 0.31 mmol, 3.5 equiv). The reaction was warmed to −10 °C; these conditions were maintained for 1 h before quenching with 1 mL of DI H2O (the reaction did not reach completion by TLC analysis). The reaction was washed with 2 mL of saturated NaHCO3(aq) solution and extracted with 5 mL of CH2Cl2. Next, it was dried with Na2SO4, filtered, and then concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was then purified by column chromatography (3% EtOAc in hexanes) to obtain (S)-1-(((5-chloropent-1-en-3-yl)oxy)methyl)-4-methoxybenzene (2.2 mg, 0.0091 mmol, 10% yield) as a pale-yellow oil. 1H and 13C NMR spectral data matched those reported in the literature.5 Er [93.5:6.5] (Chiralcel OD-H; 1% i-PrOH in hexanes; flow rate = 1.0 mL/min; detection at (230) nm; t1 = 5.18 min (major); t2 = 5.49 min (minor).

4-Bromobut-1-ene

To freshly distilled 3,4-buten-1-ol (28.5 g, 0.40 mol) was added freshly distilled pyridine (9.0 mL, 0.11 mol, 0.28 equiv) at an ambient temperature, and then the mixture was cooled to 0 °C. Phosphorus tribromide (14.9 mL, 0.16 mol, 0.4 equiv) was added dropwise to the reaction, pausing addition if the reaction fumed excessively. The conditions were maintained for 0.5 h after the addition, and then the reaction was warmed to 21 °C. 1H NMR monitoring showed complete conversion after 2 h. The product was distilled under atmospheric pressure by heating to 150 °C (vapor temperatures 130–132 °C). The distilled product was washed with 40 mL of saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution and dried with Na2SO4 (without rinsing the drying agent) to obtain 4-bromobut-1-ene (42.9 g, 0.32 mol, 80% yield) as a clear, colorless oil. 1H and 13C NMR spectral data matched those reported in the literature.14

But-3-en-1-ylmagnesium Bromide (12)

To a suspension of Mg turnings (5.47 g, 0.23 mol) and 10 μL of 1,2-dibromoethane in THF, 4-bromobut-1-ene (31.98 g, 0.24 mol, 1.05 equiv) was added dropwise at an ambient temperature. 0.5 h after substrate addition, the reaction was heated to 75 °C so reflux was observed. Conditions were maintained for 1 h until Mg turnings were completely consumed in solution. The solution was utilized immediately after it was cooled to ambient temperature for the following reaction.

(R)-1-Chlorooct-7-en-3-ol

To a solution of 9 (16.8 g, 0.16 mol) in 90 mL of THF, CuCN (0.678 g, 7.9 mmol, 0.05 equiv) was added. The mixture was cooled to −60 °C before 1.0 M but-3-en-1-ylmagnesium bromide solution in THF (0.225 L, 0.23 mol, 1.4 equiv) was added dropwise to the reaction. The conditions were maintained for 0.5 h after Grignard reagent addition, and then the reaction was allowed to warm to −30 °C over the course of 0.75 h. The temperature conditions were maintained for 0.5 h before allowing the reaction to warm to 0 °C over the course of 0.5 h. The reaction was kept at 0 °C for 0.75 h when TLC analysis indicated a complete reaction. 0.1 L of saturated NH4Cl(aq) solution was added to quench at 0 °C and then warmed to 21 °C. The temperature conditions were maintained for 1 h before washing with brine and extracting with EtOAc. The solution was dried with Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. This afforded the crude product (25.9 g), which was submitted to the next reaction without further purification.

(R)-tert-Butyl((1-chlorooct-7-en-3-yl)oxy)dimethylsilane (13)

The crude product (R)-1-chlorooct-7-en-3-ol (25.9 g, ∼0.16 mol) from the previous reaction was dissolved in 50 mL of CH2Cl2; imidazole (32.6 g, 0.48 mol, 3.0 equiv) was added in one portion. The reaction was cooled to 0 °C, and then tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (31.5 g, 0.21 mol, 1.5 equiv) was added in three portions. The temperature conditions were maintained for 0.5 h before warming to 21 °C. The reaction was stirred at an ambient temperature for 12 h; quenched with 50 mL of DI H2O; washed with DI H2O (2 × 30 mL) and then brine (30 mL) while extracting with 50 mL of hexanes; dried with Na2SO4; filtered; and then concentrated in vacuo.

A 250 mL round-bottom flask was charged with a stirbar, gas inlet adapter, and septum before it was flame-dried under vacuum and backfilled with argon. The flask was charged with SnCl2 (2.53 g, 13 mmol, 1.19 equiv) under nitrogen and then reconnected to an argon line. 6.7 mL of distilled acetonitrile was added before the mixture was cooled to 0 °C. Thiophenol (4.1 mL, 40 mmol, 3.57 equiv) was added dropwise to the reaction, followed by dropwise addition of distilled triethylamine (5.6 mL, 40 mmol, 3.57 equiv). The reaction's color change from colorless to bright yellow was observed. The reaction was removed from the cold bath to reach ambient temperature for 15 min, after which the reaction was cooled back down to 0 °C again. A solution of 25 (11.2 g, 11 mmol) in 4.5 mL of distilled acetonitrile was added dropwise to the reaction mixture at 0 °C. Once the substrate solution had been completely included in the reaction, the reaction mixture was removed from the cold bath and allowed to reach ambient temperature. The reaction's color change from yellow to orange, as well as gas evolution, was observed.

(4aS,6E,11R,12aS,16aR,18E,23R,24aS)-3,4,8,9,10,11,12a,15,16,16a,20,21,22,23-Tetradecahydro-2H,5H,14H,17H-1,23:11,13-diethano[1,11]dioxacycloicosino[2,3-b:12,13-b′]dipyridin-4a(24aH)-ol

A 100 mL round-bottom flask and a 250 mL round-bottom flask (charged with a glass stirbar) were dried under vacuum and backfilled with argon. Both flasks were cooled to −78 °C. NH3 was condensed from a cylinder into the 100 mL round-bottom flask, marked to 50 mL, before it was cannulated into the precooled 250 mL round-bottom flask. Lithium metal was added in six portions amounting to 0.373 g (54 mmol, ∼30 equiv) in total, and the solution was observed to change from colorless to a deep-blue color. The reaction was warmed to −40 °C for 1 h. After this, the solution was again cooled to −78 °C for 20 min, before 2 mL of THF was added. The substrate 33 (0.869 g, 1.8 mmol) was prepared as a solution in 30 mL of THF (and 3 mL to rinse the original container and syringe), which was added dropwise to the reaction at −78 °C. The reaction was kept at −78 °C for 15 min before warming to −40 °C and maintaining the temperature for 30 min. After this time, the reaction was quenched with the addition of 5 g NH4Cl(s), followed by 30 mL of THF and warming to 21 °C for 20 min. 5 mL of DI H2O was added before 30 mL CH2Cl2 was included. The reaction was washed with 20 mL of 1 M NaOH(aq) and extracted with 10 mL of CH2Cl2. The crude product material was submitted to column chromatography (reverse-phase silica gel) (10% DI H2O in MeOH to 5% DI H2O in MeOH) and isolated as a mixture of three products weighing 0.606 g as a white semisolid. The material was submitted as a mixture to the final reaction in the synthesis.

(+)-Desmethylxestospongin B (1)

The product mixture from the previous reaction (0.606 g) was dissolved in HPLC-grade EtOAc. 5 wt % rhodium on alumina (0.304 g) was added to the solution, and the reaction vessel was sealed. A balloon filled with H2 was fixed to a syringe with needle and was introduced through the septum of the reaction vessel. An outlet needle was introduced, and H2 was allowed to bubble through the solution for 5 min, after which the outlet needle was removed and the H2 source needle was placed above the reaction solution. Every 30 min, H2 was bubbled through the reaction mixture for 5 min and the reaction was monitored by 1H NMR; after 2 h, the reaction was deemed complete. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite (filtering agent was rinsed with HPLC-grade EtOAc) and concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified via column chromatography (reverse-phase silica gel) (10% H2O in MeOH to 5% H2O in MeOH) to give 1 (0.366 g, 0.79 mmol, 45% yield over two steps) as a white solid. 1H and 13C NMR spectral data matched those reported in the literature.5
