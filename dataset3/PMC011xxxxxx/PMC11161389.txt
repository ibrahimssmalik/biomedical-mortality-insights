Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a prominent neoplasm globally ranking third in prevalence amongst humans and standing as the second leading cause for cancer‐associated fatalities. 1 , 2 The fundamental molecular mechanisms driving CRC progress remain largely uninvestigated. Spindle and kinetochore‐associated complex subunit 3 (SKA3) is an indispensable constituent of the SKA complex that plays a crucial role in stabilising the interaction between kinetochores and microtubules during mitosis. 3 , 4 Emerging evidence suggests SKA3 is implicated in the progression of various malignancies. 5 , 6 However, the functional role and mechanism of SKA3 in CRC remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that SKA3 is pivotal in CRC progress and the SKA3/PTTG1/c‐MYC axis could potentially be a latent therapeutic target for CRC.

We initially conducted RNA‐seq analysis using five pairs of CRC and normal tissues and found that SKA3 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues (Figure S1A), which was also validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases (GSE83889, GSE106582, and GSE87211) (Figure S1B–E). A Kaplan–Meier analysis in GSE29623 demonstrated patients with high expression levels of SKA3 had unfavorable overall survival (Figure S1F). Western blot assay and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) also confirmed a significant increase of the SKA3 expression in CRC tissues (Figure 1A,B). Compared to normal colorectal cell CCD‐18Co, CRC cells displayed elevated levels of SKA3 expression (Figure S1G). In vitro, SKA3 knockdown reduced proliferation, migration and invasion of HCT116 and RKO cells (Figure 1C–G and Figure S2A), whilst SKA3 overexpression leaded to opposite effects (Figure S2A–H). Besides, SKA3 knockdown diminished Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) expression, whilst SKA3 overexpression resulted in increased PCNA expression (Figure 1H and Figure S2I). According to the western blot assay of Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)‐associated markers (E‐cadherin and N‐cadherin), SKA3 could also induce the EMT process (Figure 1H and Figure S2I). In vivo, both the volume and weight of xenograft tumours in the shSKA3 group exhibited significant delays (Figure 1I–K). The IHC analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in Ki‐67 expression, N‐cadherin and vimentin, but an increase in E‐cadherin within the shSKA3 group (Figure 1L). Besides, the shSKA3 group showed a marked decrease in both the number of lung metastatic nodules and lung weight compared to the control group (Figure 1M,N).

(I,J) Tumour volumes in the shNC and shSKA3 groups were measured every 3 days and growth curves were plotted (n = 6 per group).

(N) The number of lung metastatic nodules and lung weight were counted (n = 5 per group). SKA3, Spindle and kinetochore‐associated complex subunit 3; IHC, immunohistochemical.

Then, we performed RNA‐seq analysis in shNC and shSKA3 HCT116 cells and the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed a notable positive correlation between SKA3 and MYC‐targeted signalling pathways (Figure 2A–C), which was also supported by the TCGA database (Figure 2D and Figure S3A,B). Additionally, the IHC results showed dxenograft tumours in the shSKA3 group exhibited lower levels of c‐MYC protein (Figure 2E). The experimental results indicated that when SKA3 was knocked down, both protein and mRNA levels of c‐MYC decreased (Figure 2F). Conversely, overexpression of SKA3 led to an increased expression level of c‐MYC (Figure 2G). Besides, SKA3 and c‐MYC target gene mRNA levels were positively corelated in the TCGA database and GEO database (GSE83889, GSE106582 and GSE87211) (Figure 2H), and it was further confirmed by the qPCR analysis (Figure 2I,J). Subsequently, to ascertain whether the effects of SKA3 on CRC cell were dependent on c‐MYC, rescue experiments were conducted and the efficacy of interference was confirmed through western blot analysis (Figure S3C). The results demonstrated that the increased abilities of cell proliferation, migration and invasion induced by SKA3 were abolished by knocking down c‐MYC (Figure 2K–N and Figure S3D–G).

(K,L) Colony formation assay indicated the change in cell proliferation ability of CRC cells under SKA3 overexpression was depend on c‐MYC. (M,N) Transwell assay indicated the change in cell migration and invasion abilities of CRC cells under SKA3 overexpression was depend on c‐MYC. SKA3, Spindle and kinetochore‐associated complex subunit 3; CRC, colorectal cancer.

To further investigate the regulatory mechanism of SKA3 on c‐MYC, we employed the BioGRID and STRING online databases to identify potential protein interactors of SKA3 (Figure 3A). Amongst these candidates, PTTG1 caught our attention as it functions as a transcriptional activator for c‐MYC. 7 Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated direct binding between PTTG1 and the promoter region of c‐MYC in CRC cells (Figure 3B,C). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the reduction of the PTTG1 expression resulted in a notable decreased luciferase activity of the c‐MYC‐promoter‐WT reporter in HCT116 cell, whilst the luciferase activity of MUT c‐MYC reporter did not show any significant change (Figure 3D). Additionally, knockdown of PTTG1 in HCT116 and RKO cells resulted in a notable decrease in both c‐MYC mRNA and protein levels (Figure 3E and Figure S4A,B). Therefore, PTTG1 is a transcriptional activator for c‐MYC in CRC cells (Figure 3F). As expected, co‐immunofluorescence analysis and co‐immunoprecipitation (Co‐IP) assay confirmed the interaction between SKA3 and PTTG1 (Figure 3G,H). Intriguingly, our findings demonstrated although SKA3 could not significantly alter the PTTG1 protein expression level (Figure S4C,D), SKA3 overexpression effectively facilitated the nuclear translocation of PTTG1 (Figure 3I–M). The dual‐luciferase analysis revealed a significant reduction in the c‐MYC transcriptional activity upon knockdown of SKA3 in CRC cells, whilst overexpression of SKAS yielded an opposite effect (Figure 3N,O). However, it was observed that SKA3 had no influence on the activity of the c‐MYC promoter containing mutant PTTG1 binding sites (Figure 3N,O). These results provide evidence that supports the positive role of SKA3 in regulating c‐MYC transcriptional activity through its interaction with PTTG1 and facilitation of PTTG1 nuclear translocation.

(A) The Venn diagram was used to illustrate the overlap between proteins interacting with SKA3 analysed by STRING and BioGRID database. (B,C) PTTG1 enrichment at the c‐MYC promoter was measured using a PTTG1 antibody to perform the ChIP assay.

Moreover, the Cistrome DB Toolkit and JASPAR analysis revealed that c‐MYC may exert regulatory effects on the SKA3 expression as a transcription factor and the c‐MYC binding site (TCACCTGC) was predicted to be situated at −167 to −174 upstream of the SKA3 TSS (Figure 4A and Figure S5). The GRNdb database and single‐cell RNA sequencing also confirmed a significant correlation between SKA3 expression and c‐MYC expression at the transcriptional level (Figure 4B). In HCT116 and RKO cells, c‐MYC knockdown could result in a decrease in SKA3 mRNA and protein expression (Figure 4C–E). Besides, the luciferase reporter and ChIP assays indicated c‐MYC could bind to the SKA3 promoter and enhance SKA3 transcription (Figure 4F–I). IHC staining on CRC tissue samples also revealed a significant correlation between expression levels of SKA3 and c‐MYC (Figure 4J).

(B) Feature plots and a scatterplot depict the correlation between SKA3 and c‐MYC in the TCGA‐CRC single cell transcriptome. (C–E) SKA3 expression was detected by q‐PCR and western blotting after c‐MYC knockdown in HCT116 and RKO cells. (F,G) c‐MYC enrichment at the SKA3 promoter was measured using a c‐MYC antibody to perform the ChIP assay. (H,I) The dual‐luciferase analysis for SKA3 transcriptional activity was performed in HCT116 and RKO cells with or without c‐MYC knockdown. (J) Representative IHC staining of CRC tissues showed the correlation between c‐MYC and SKA3 expression levels.

In summary, we found SKA3 could interact with PTTG1 (a transcriptional activator for c‐MYC), which facilitates nuclear translocation of PTTG1, resulting in upregulation of c‐MYC expression. Moreover, the SKA3 expression could be transcriptionally upregulated by c‐MYC, resulting in a positive feedback axis to promote CRC progression (Figure 4K).
