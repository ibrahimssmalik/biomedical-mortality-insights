Polyglycidol or polyglycerol (PG), a polyether widely used in biomedical applications, has not been extensively studied in its branched cyclic form (bcPG), despite extensive research on hyperbranched PG (HPG). This study explores the biomedical promise of bcPG, particularly its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). We evaluate in vitro biocompatibility, endothelial permeability, and formation of branched linear PG (blPG) as topological impurities in the presence of water. Small angle X-ray scattering in solution revealed a fractal dimension of approximately two for bcPG and the mixture bc+blPG, suggesting random branching. Comparisons of cytotoxicity and endothelial permeability between bcPG, bc+blPG, and HPG in a BBB model using hCMEC/D3 cells showed different biocompatibility profiles and higher endothelial permeability for HPG. bcPG showed a tendency to accumulate around cell nuclei, in contrast to the behavior of HPG. This study contributes to the understanding of the influence of polymer topology on biological behavior.

Polyglycidol, also known as polyglycerol (PG), is a polyether frequently used in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Its popularity stems from its biocompatibility and notable functionality, enabling the binding of molecules with biomedical significance.1−3 Various PG architectures have been studied including linear, dendritic, and hyperbranched structures. Hyperbranched PG (HPG) is characterized by a random distribution of hydroxyl groups throughout its globular structure, which in contrast to perfect dendrimeric structures the hydroxyl groups are not located at the same distance from the core. HPG is typically obtained through the ring-opening multibranching polymerization (ROMBP) of glycidol using partially deprotonated multifunctional hydroxyl initiators.4 HPG has demonstrated exceptional encapsulation capabilities for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, making it highly valuable for controlled and targeted drug delivery, improving therapeutic efficacy while reducing side effects.5,6 HPG has been investigated for use in 2D surface3,7,8 and nanoparticle (NP) coatings,8−11 providing antifouling properties that reduce the adhesion of proteins, cells, fungi, and bacteria.12

The influence of the architecture of PGs on their biological properties and the unique advantages of PGs over the widely used PEG have also been addressed in a number of studies, as reviewed elsewhere.1−3 For example, a comparative blood compatibility study of linear PG (LPG), HPG, and PEG with molecular weights of ∼100 kDa showed that unlike PEG, LPG and HPG did not induce undesirable red blood cell aggregation and hemolysis.13 In that study, LPG showed shorter blood circulation, higher renal clearance, and deformability compared to HPG. Other in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility studies of LPG and HPG with lower molecular weights of ∼6 kDa showed that the topology had no effect on their biocompatibility.14 The influence of the architecture of the PGs on their biological activity was also evaluated in bioconjugation studies. Comparative studies of LPG-, HPG- and PEG-anakinra bioconjugates showed that LPG conjugates exhibited significantly better proteolytic stability than their PEG analogues, and all conjugates significantly prolonged the elimination half-life of anakinra, with LPG and PEG conjugates prolonging it 4-fold compared to the unmodified protein.15 Other bioconjugation studies were performed to compare the performance of LPG- and PEG-modified proteins (e.g., interleukin-4 WT,16 interferon α2a,17 and erythropoietin18) in terms of their bioactivity. The PEGylated and PGylated forms of interleukin-4 WT and erythropoietin showed similar biological activities, whereas those of interferon α2a showed different pharmacokinetics. In this case, a faster initial distribution rate was observed for the LPGylated-interferon α2a bioconjugates compared to the PEGylated ones.17 HPG has shown significantly improved properties compared to PEG when used to coat NPs.8−10 Some of these properties include longer blood circulation and significantly lower liver accumulation for HPG-based NPs compared to analogous PEG-based NPs, as well as higher stability in suspension and better therapeutic efficacy against tumors in vivo.9

HPGs also exhibit interesting physical properties related to their globular structure, which have been extensively studied over the past 25 years.1−3 For instance, high-molar-mass HPGs exhibit low intrinsic viscosity (e.g., 6.15 mL/g for an HPG structure with Mw of 9.3 × 106 Da), which is similar to globular proteins in aqueous solutions, and which is substantially higher than that of an equivalent PEG of Mw of 11 × 106 Da (2600 mL/g).19 The intrinsic viscosity for HPGs at moderate and high Mw has been observed to be independent of the molecular masses, in contrast to PEG, whose intrinsic viscosity follows a Mark–Houwink–Sakurada behavior with an exponent of ∼0.7.19 HPGs are soluble in water at high concentrations (>400 mg/mL), in contrast to PEG, which tends to aggregate, exhibiting both upper and lower critical solution temperature phenomena in water.20

Branched cyclic-core PG (bcPG) has been obtained by zwitterionic ring-opening polymerization (ZROP) of glycidol (Gly) with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3],21,22 a mechanism also called electrophilic zwitterionic ring expansion polymerization (eZREP)23,24 (Scheme 1a). Initiation occurs by reaction of B(C6F5)3 with both the epoxide and alcohol oxygen of Gly. The generated oxonium ions are prone to attack by further epoxide and hydroxyl groups of Gly at the methine (alfa) and methylene (beta) carbons, leading to a chain structure formed by L1,3 and L1,4 linear units. The active chain end (ACE) ROP mechanism is the one operating via the attack of epoxide ring to oxonium ions located at the chain end, and the activated monomer (AM) ROP mechanism is the one occurring via the attack of hydroxyl groups.25 Both charges of the propagating zwitterionic chain travel together, facilitating the incorporation of a new Gly monomer into the structure while maintaining the preformed cyclic structure. Termination occurs by end-biting. Additionally, hydroxyl side groups can react with the growing chains to form branches in dendritic (D) structures and T1 and T2 terminal units.21

Scheme 1 Competitive Mechanisms of Initiation of Gly by (a) B(C6F5)3 and (b) H3O+ Leading to the Formation of Cyclic-Core and Linear-Core Branched Structures, Respectively26

Both topologies are formed by linear (L1,3 and L1,4), dendritic (D), and terminal units (T1 and T2).

In this polymerization mechanism, water may play a role in both the termination and initiation processes. A chain transfer reaction with water would result in the formation of chains terminated with hydroxyl groups, thereby inhibiting the formation of cyclic structures. Water can also initiate the polymerization by protonating Gly epoxide through the hydronium ions formed in a reaction between B(C6F5)3 and two water molecules (Scheme 1b).26 This mechanism competes with that producing bcPG by forming linear-core branched PGs (blPG).26 Of particular significance is that both structures, bcPG and blPG, are formed from the beginning of the polymerization reaction due to similar kinetics.26 In practical applications, the existence of blPG chains in bcPG samples might be undesirable as they could be considered topological impurities. Therefore, further studies of the formation of blPG structures and their properties are warranted.

The exploration of bcPG structures is presently ongoing for diverse applications in material synthesis. These applications include adhesives,27 stabilizers of pigment particles,28 and self-healing materials.29 The distinctive topology of bcPGs played a crucial role in influencing the performance and properties of these materials. In the biomedical field, we also expect bcPG to demonstrate favorable performance comparable to well-established HPGs and HPG-based materials.1−3,30−32 Their hyperbranched structure, similar to HPGs, may impart desirable properties such as enhanced biocompatibility, low toxicity, and versatility in functionalization. A deeper understanding of the interactions between bcPGs (and its topological impurity blPG) and biological systems is needed.

The objective of this study was 2-fold. First, we aimed to investigate the impact of water on the formation of blPG structures in bcPG samples generated by ZROP. Second, our goal was to assess the biocompatibility characteristics of these PG structures and their ability to cross a model of biological barriers. Among biological barriers, the most complex and challenging to overcome is the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a highly selective and protective physiological barrier composed of specialized endothelial cells that tightly regulate the passage of substances from the bloodstream into the brain, maintaining the unique microenvironment required for proper neural function.33 By addressing these dual objectives, we aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the biological response of PG structures from a topological perspective.

To achieve these aims, the polymerization of Gly was conducted under bulk conditions using B(C6F5)3 as a catalyst and varying amounts of water, ranging from dry conditions to an extremely large excess of water ([H2O]0/[B(C6F5)3]0= 600/1). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) revealed an increase in blPG structures with increasing water content in the system, alongside bcPG topologies that are generated under all conditions. These results indicate that bcPG is the most favored thermodynamic product, while obtaining blPG with a topological purity is not feasible. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data were obtained to analyze the structure and chain conformation of the synthesized bcPGs, revealing more compact structures (smaller Rg values) in the absence of water, where blPGs do not form, compared to the polymerization performed in the presence of water. Then, PGs were labeled with approximately 3 mol % of the fluorescence dye rhodamine B to facilitate tracking in biological assays. These experiments showed that PGs can be taken up by the cells and that polymer concentrations up to 100 μg mL–1 are well tolerated. By using HPG as a control topology, the results indicated that the topology of the PGs plays an essential role in the BBB crossing in vitro.

Experimental Section

Materials for Polymer Synthesis and Functionalization

Glycidol (Gly) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled from CaH2 under reduced pressure, and B(C6F5)3 was sublimated. Rhodamine B (RhB), sodium hydride (NaH), dichloromethane, methanol, and diethyl ether were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) were purchased from Acros Organics. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane (TMP) were purchased from Thermo Scientific.

Synthesis of bcPG

In a typical reaction (Entry 7, Table 1), 3 mL of Gly (0.045 mol) was cooled to 0 °C in a round-bottom flask under propeller stirring. 29 mg of B(C6F5)3 (57 μmol) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of CH2Cl2 and gradually added to Gly. The reaction was stirred for 24 h. Termination was performed by adding methanol. 1H NMR of crude reactions was recorded in D2O to determine the monomer conversion. The reaction was purified by precipitation in acetone from a methanol solution and centrifugation. Finally, samples were dried at 120 °C in a vacuum oven overnight (yield = 90 wt %).

c The viscosity increased rapidly within a few minutes of initiating the polymerization.

Synthesis of bc+blPG

In a typical reaction (Entry 8, Table 1), 3 mL of Gly (0.045 mol) was cooled to 0 °C in a round-bottom flask under propeller stirring. 29 mg of B(C6F5)3 (57 μmol) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of CH2Cl2, mixed with 30 μL of water, and gradually added to Gly. Termination was performed by adding methanol. 1H NMR of crude reactions was recorded in D2O to determine the monomer conversion. The reaction was purified by precipitation in acetone from methanol solution and centrifugation. Finally, samples were dried at 120 °C in a vacuum oven overnight (yield = 50 wt %).

Synthesis of HPG

HPG was synthesized following a literature procedure.34 Briefly, TMP (18.8 mg, 0.140 mmol) and NaH (1.0 mg, 0.042 mmol) were added into a flame-dried round-bottomed flask in a glovebox. Then, 1 mL of dry THF was added, and the mixture was stirred at 95 °C for 30 min. The activation of the hydroxyl group was proved by a pale-yellow coloration of the suspension. Then, Gly (1.1 g, 14.8 mmol) was added using a syringe pump during 24 h under an argon atmosphere. After the reaction completion, the polymer was solubilized in a few mL of HCl 0.1 N in MeOH and poured into 500 mL of diethyl ether. Then, the polymer was collected by centrifugation (monomer conversion = 96%, Mn = 5 kDa, PDI = 1.6, degree of branching = 0.50).

Fractionation of Polymers

Fractions of Entry 7 were obtained by fractional precipitation from a methanol solution (13 mL) of 1.5 g of polymer. Initially, 6 mL of diethyl ether was added, causing the precipitation of the first fraction, which was separated by centrifugation. The remaining solution was successively precipitated with further additions of about 7 to 15 mL of diethyl ether. Similarly, fractions of Entry 8 were produced from a methanol solution (10 mL) of 0.8 g of the polymer. Initial amount of 7.5 mL of diethyl ether was needed to generate the first polymer fraction. Next fractions were generated by successively adding 1.5 to 4 mL of diethyl ether.

Functionalization of Polyglycidol with Rhodamine B

50 mg of PG (HPG, Entry 7/F3 and Entry 8/F1) (0.68 mmol of OH groups) was dissolved in 5 mL of anhydrous DMF. 12 mg of DMAP (0.10 mmol), 60 mg of EDC (0.38 mmol), and 159 mg of RhB (0.33 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction was directly poured into 500 mL of cold diethyl ether, and the polymer was separated by centrifugation and dialyzed in water. The product was finally dried by lyophilization. The degree of functionalization was determined by integration of the CH3 signal of RhB (, 3H) at 1.3 ppm and PG signals (IPG, 5H) at 3.4–4.1 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra. In the calculation, the corresponding integral of RhB CH2 signal (, 2H) at 3.7 ppm () was subtracted from the signal at 3.4–4.1 ppm. RhB-functionalized bcPG and bc+blPG were verified by 19F NMR to be free of B(C6F5)3.

Cell Line

Immortalized human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) were provided by Dr. S. Bourdoulous (Institut Cochin, Inserm, Paris, France) and used as a model of the brain capillary endothelium.35 Cells at passage between 25 and 35 were seeded on tissue culture flasks and pretreated with rat tail collagen type I (0.05 mg/mL). Cells were grown in complete culture medium (EBM-2 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% chemically defined lipid concentrate (CDLC), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), 10 mM Hepes, 5 μg/mL ascorbic acid, 1 ng/mL bFGF, and 1.4 μM hydrocortisone) and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The culture medium was changed every 2 days.

In Vitro BBB Model

The in vitro BBB model was prepared and characterized, as previously described,36 using hCMEC/D3 cells. Briefly, cells were seeded (56,000 cells/cm2) onto collagen-coated (150 μg/mL rat tail collagen type 1; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) transwell filters (polyester 12-well, pore size 0.4 μm, translucent membrane inserts 1.12 cm2; Costar) to establish a polarized monolayer. The cell monolayer separates into two compartments: an apical one (0.5 mL) representing the blood and a basolateral one (1 mL) representing the brain. Cells were grown for 3 days in a complete EBM-2 medium. After 3 days, the medium was replaced with EBM-2 supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% CDLC, 1% P/S, 10 mM Hepes, 5 μg/mL of ascorbic acid, 1.4 μM hydrocortisone, and 10 mM LiCl. The formation of junctions was evaluated by measuring TEER, monitored with STX2 electrode Epithelial Volt-Ohm meter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, United States) and the paracellular permeability to TRITC-dextran 4400 Da (λecc = 557 nm, λem = 572 nm) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy).

Cell Viability Assay

The effect of chain topology on hCMEC/D3 viability was assessed by the MTT assay using RhB-functionalized PG samples (bcPG, bc+blPG, and HPG).36 hCMEC/D3 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 20,000 cells per well. Different doses of PG, ranging from 1 to 1000 μg mL–1, were added to the culture medium. After 24 h, the assay was performed as per the manufacturer’s protocol, and absorbance was measured at 690 and 570 nm using a microplate reader (SPECTROstar Nano, BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany). Results are presented as the mean of three independent experiments ± SD considering untreated cells as 100% of the cell viability. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 software, and the statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA.

Characterization Techniques

Monomer conversion was determined by1H NMR. The spectra of polymer samples synthesized in flasks were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance Neo 400. Around 5 mg of crude polymer samples was dissolved in approximately 0.5 mL of D2O. Signal integration of free monomer at 2.6–2.9 ppm (CH2OH, 2H) and that combining PG (5H) and free monomer (CH2OCH, 3H) at 3.1–4.0 ppm were used in the calculation. Relative abundance of structural units and degree of branching (DB) was determined by inverse gated 13C NMR following previous works.21,22 The spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance Neo 500. Around 50 mg of purified polymers was dissolved in 0.5 mL of D2O. DB was calculated from DB = 2D/(2D + L), where, D and L = L1,3 + L1,4 are the relative abundance of dendritic and linear structures, respectively.4 Note that the eq DB = (D + T)/(D + T + L), where T = T1 + T2 is the relative abundance of terminal units, would lead to an overestimation of DB for small or low branched molecules, as explained in ref37 and shown in Table S1.

GPC data were acquired using a Nexera instrument from Shimadzu using a refractive index detector (RID-20A, Shimadzu) and MALS detector (λ = 663.89 nm, miniDawn, Wyatt). DMF containing 0.1% LiBr with a flow of 1.0 mL/min was used as an eluent. Separation was performed at 50 °C by using a CTO 40C column oven and Polargel-M Guard 50 × 7.5 mm and Polargel-M 300 × 7.5 mm, 8 μm, GPC columns. The absolute molecular weights were determined using a dn/dc value38 of 0.054 mL/g and Astra 8.1 software from Wyatt Technology.

MALDI-TOF MS measurements were performed on a Bruker Autoflex Speed system (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a Smartbeam-II laser (Nd:YAG, 355 nm, 2 kHz). Spectra were acquired in reflectron mode; each mass spectrum was the average of 10,000 shots. The laser power was adjusted during the experiments. Polymer samples were dissolved in MeOH at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a matrix. The matrix was dissolved in MeOH at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Lithium trifluoroacetate (LiTFA, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a cation donor (10 mg/mL dissolved in MeOH). The polymer samples were mixed with the matrix and salt in a 10:10:1 (matrix/polymer/salt) ratio. Approximately 0.5 μL of the obtained solution was spotted by hand on the ground steel target plate and allowed to dry in the air. Spectra were accumulated and processed using FlexControl (v3.4) and FlexAnalysis software (v3.4), respectively. Peaks were detected in SNAP mode with a signal-to-noise threshold of 3.00 before being processed with a Savitzky–Golay smoothing algorithm (0.05 m/z width, one cycle) and “TopHat” baseline subtraction. External calibration was performed in quadratic mode with a mixture of different polystyrene standards (PS, Varian).

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out on ∼5 mg specimens using a Q2000 TA Instruments. All samples were measured by placing them in aluminum pans without using lids, following confirmation that the type of pan significantly influenced data reproducibility.21 The sample was first cooled from room temperature to −100 °C and then heated to 150 °C at 10 °C/min (first heating run). Then, samples were cooled back to −100 °C at 10 °C/min and finally heated to 150 °C at 10 °C/min (second heating run). A helium flow rate of 25 mL/min was used throughout. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were determined from the maximum of the first derivative in the second heating run.

The SAXS experiments were performed using the automated BM29 bioSAXS beamline at the ESRF, Grenoble, France. For technical details, we refer to the ref39. The data were obtained using an energy of 12.5 keV and detector distance 2.87 m covering a Q-range (Q = 4π sin (θ/2)/λ, λ is the wavelength, θ is the scattering angle) of about 0.0047 Å-1< Q < 0.5 Å–1. The data were calibrated to an absolute intensity scale using water as a primary standard.

Data Modeling

The total intensity can be written as1

φ is the volume fraction of the polymer, Mw is the molecular weight, dp is the solution density of the polymer, and ρp and ρ0 are the scattering length densities of the polymer and buffer, respectively. The solution density required to estimate ρp, was measured using an Anton Paar DMA5000 densitometer and gave dp = 1.34 g/mL for polyglycidol (Entry 7 sample). The scattering length density is calculated according to2

where Mp is the molecular weight of the monomer and r0 is Thomson radius.

For the form factor, P(Q)poly, either a random chain form factor described by the Debye function for Gaussian chains, P(Q)Debye or a general form factor for arbitrary chain statistics, P(Q)Beaucage,40 described by3

where Rg is the radius gyration of the polymer chain.4

where Rg is the radius of gyration, df is the fractal dimension (df = 2 and 1.7 for theta and good solvent respectively). Γ(x) is the gamma function, and erf(x) is the error function.

For the density measurements of the different surfactants, a DMA 4500 M liquid/solution density meter from Anton Paar was used. The specific volume of the polymer was calculated according to where wp is the weight fraction, d0 is the solvent (water) density and dsol is the polymer solution density.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy

CLSM was employed to estimate the uptake and the intracellular localization of the fluorescently labeled PGs. CLSM pictures were taken using an LSM710-inverted confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 63×/1.4 oil objective (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Excitation was performed using two ultraviolet–visible-laser diodes 25 mV (405–488) and Ar-laser (540 nm) at 10% intensity. The pinhole was set to 1A. Image acquisition was performed sequentially to minimize cross-talk between the fluorophores. The hCMEC/D3 cells were incubated at 37 °C with PG for 3 h, rinsed three times with PBS, and fixed with a 10% (v/v) formalin solution. After three washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, then rinsed twice and incubated with a solution of 1% (v/v) phalloidin (actin filaments staining) in PBS for 1 h, then with 20 μM DAPI (nuclear staining) in PBS for 10 min. After three washes, the samples were mounted using poly(vinyl alcohol) mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich). All washes were performed with PBS.

Results and Discussion

Synthesis of Polyglycidol

bcPG was synthesized by reaction of Gly with B(C6F5)3 in the absence of water (hereafter “dry” polymerization) under bulk conditions at 0 °C for 24 h by using [Gly]0/[B(C6F5)3]0 = 594 and 800 (Entries 1 and 7, Table 1). The effect of water on the PG structure was investigated with a series of reactions carried out in the presence of varying amounts of water (hereafter “wet” conditions) and by changing the temperature (Entries 2–6 and 8–10, Table 1). The results showed that the Mn obtained experimentally was higher than those calculated theoretically in all cases of “wet” polymerization considering the initial molar concentration ratio of [Gly]0/[H2O]0, and that it decreased by increasing the amount of water. The latter observation was expected from an increase in the number of transfer reactions with free water. In the absence of water, the theoretical Mn calculated considering B(C6F5)3 as the initiator does not conform to [Gly]0/[B(C6F5)3]0 due to the release of the catalyst upon cyclization with the consequent reinitiation of the monomer, as previously described in ZROP with B(C6F5)3.21,41 As a result, the Mn obtained experimentally under “dry” conditions is, in all cases, smaller than the theoretical ones. The dispersity values of synthesized polymers were nearly 2 and decreased to values below 2 at very high water content. GPC data of representative samples synthesized in “dry” and “wet” conditions are compared in Figure 1. The molecular weight of the peak maxima (Mp) accounts for the peak shift toward lower values with increasing amounts of water. At very large amounts of water, [H2O]0/[B(C6F5)3]0 > 250, the polymerizations became too slow. To alleviate this problem, we investigated raising the temperature to 60 °C, but in some cases, it resulted in fast reactions manifested in a sudden increase in viscosity and the release of white smoke (Entries 6 and 9). This response is a sign of an autoacceleration caused by a fast initiation.

The analysis of the relative abundance of structural units and the degree of branching (DB) is shown in Table 2 (NMR spectra in Figures S1–S3). In going from Entry 1 to Entry 5, and from Entry 7 to 10, the amounts of T1 units increase with a concomitant decrease of D units (and DB), a fact that can be directly related to an increasing number of transfer reactions with water and the consumption of active species. The less likely T2 structure (5–6%) seems to be independent of the amount of water in the reaction. Concerning the amounts of linear structures, L1,3 and L1,4, they are formed with equal probability in the samples, except when the reaction is violent at 60 °C, where the amounts of L1,3 exceed those of L1,4 (Entries 6 and 9).

MALDI-ToF-MS data of representative samples synthesized in “wet” conditions exhibited high-intensity peaks with Mobs (Wn) = nMGly + + MLi, accompanied by peaks of lower intensities with Mobs (Cn) = nMGly + MLi of lithium-complexed chains (Figure 2). Cn indicates the formation of cyclic chains. The most likely structure is that in which a cyclic core is surrounded by branches (referred above as bcPG).21,26Wn species are indicative of the incorporation of a water molecule into the chain, leading to a structure that is likely formed by a linear-core (or star-like-core if the linear-core is short enough) and branches (referred above as blPG).26 A qualitative analysis clearly evidence that an increase of Wn specimens occurs in samples prepared in the presence of water and that the higher the water amount, the higher the relative peak intensity of Wn compared to Cn. The data also show that, even with a significant excess of water in a system exhibiting strong acidity ([H2O]0/[B(C6F5)3]0= 600/1),42Cn species are still formed, confirming that cyclic chains are the thermodynamically favored product. Moreover, these data also indicate that blPG cannot be obtained with topological purity, that is, without the presence of bcPG units. For that reason, hereafter, we refer to samples obtained under wet conditions as a mixture of bcPG and blPG structures (bc+blPG).

Figure 2 MALDI-ToF MS (reflectron mode) data of PGs synthesized in the absence and presence of water (Entries 3, 4, 7 and 9, Table 1). Li+ was used as a cation ionization agent. Wn + Ac refers to Wn species that reacted with acetone upon precipitation and formed acetal species (Wn + 40 Da).

The presence of blPG chains in bcPG was confirmed not to affect a melt property such as Tg (Figures 3and S4). Plotting the molecular weight dependence of the Tg for both bc+blPG and bcPG, along with previously reported data for bcPG fractions,21 revealed an identical trend. All data points converged onto a single curve described by the Kanig–Ueberreiter eq (eq 5),43 where the constant k was determined to be 0.24 g/molK and the high molecular weight limiting value, Tg∞, was found to be 268 K. As reported by some of us, the presence of branches in PGs exerts a more significant influence on the Tg compared to the PG topology.21 This likely explains why the Tg was not sensitive to the presence of blPG chains in the bc+blPG mixture.5

Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering

To further analyze the structure and chain conformation of the synthesized PGs in the absence and presence of water, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments of aqueous solutions of PG samples were performed. SAXS data were obtained for PG fractions of different molecular weights generated by fractional precipitation from samples of similar DB. Five fractions were generated from Entries 7/F1–F5, and 6 fractions from Entry 8/F1–F6. Other nonfractionated samples were also measured (Entries 4, 5, and 9). We expect that fractionation of bc+blPG (Entry 8) yields a mixture with a similar composition due to the comparable chemical nature of both components, blPG and bcPG.

The SAXS data, including the data fits, are shown for various samples at different concentrations in Figures 4 and 5. The scattering curves resemble the typical scattering patterns of polymers in solution, with a Guinier-like plateau at low Q in the double logarithmic representation, followed by a close to Q–2 behavior at high Q. The data thus show that the chains are molecularly dispersed without aggregation, except Entries 7/F1 and 7/F5, which show a slight upturn at low Q for the higher concentration, indicating larger clusters. In order to obtain quantitative information about the chain conformation (Rg and fractal dimension, df) and extract the weight-average molecular weight (Mw), we employed a form factor analysis described in the experimental section. The results are reported in Table 3. The Mw values found by SAXS are in agreement with those obtained by GPC-RI-MALS.

The scaling behavior of Rg versus Mw extracted from the fits is depicted in Figure 6, together with the data collected from the literature for the hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG).44 The results show similar molecular weight dependence of Rg for PG samples obtained in the absence and presence of water but different Rg values for similar molecular weight. From the slopes, df = 2.2 was obtained for samples obtained in the presence of water and df = 2.0 for those obtained in dry conditions. These values are in agreement with those of randomly branched polymers (df = 2 in a good solvent, df = 2.28 in a θ solvent).45,46 In contrast, HPG shows a df = 3 corresponding to a globular structure.44 Interestingly, the direct form factor analysis indicated a slope at high Q that corresponds to df values for several polymers about 2.2 (Table 3, Entry 7/F1–F3). This suggests that the polymers are locally more compact, likely due to the branching. The samples exhibiting df values about 1.7–1.8 are the fractions of the lowest Mw (Entry 7/F5 and Entry 8/F6) and the nonfractionated samples (Entries 4, 5, and 9). These low df values may point to a low degree of branching in agreement with the low DB reported in Table 2 for Entries 4, 5, and 9, and the smaller DB found for fractions of lower Mw.21 Moreover, the Rg data of nonfractionated bc+blPG samples lie on the fitted line for fractionated bc+blPG samples of Entry 8, which show that their Rg values do not specifically show differences that can be attributed to a different topological composition related to their synthesis with different amounts of water.

Figure 6 Log–log plot of Rg vs Mw obtained by SAXS, indicating slope and fractal dimension (df) values. Literature data of HPG obtained by SANS.44

The data also show smaller Rg values by a factor of 1.14 for PGs obtained under dry conditions compared to those obtained in the presence of water. The cyclic core of bcPG generated in the absence of water could be responsible for a more compact structure despite the branching. Atomistic molecular dynamic simulations of cyclic and linear poly(vinyl alcohol)-graft-poly(ethylene oxide) bottlebrush polymers (BBPs) in aqueous solution showed that the cyclic-core structure is, in general, more compact than the linear analogue.47 Moreover, they found that the shape of the cyclic-core BBPs changes from donutlike to disklike to starlike with increasing side chain length and that the shape of the linear-core BBPs changes from an expanded coil to a rod/cylinder. Our PGs, despite having a less defined side chain structure due to branching, bear a resemblance to those of BBPs, where the cyclic and linear cores dominate their size. Another analogy of our experimental data with that of atomistic simulations is the Rg(wet)/Rg(dry) = 1.14 found in our experiments for identical Mw compared to Rg(L)/Rg(C) = 1.20 found at identical side chain length in the simulations.47

Cytotoxicity and Cellular Uptake of PGs

To evaluate the effect of the PG structure on their cytotoxicity, representative PG samples of similar molecular weight and degree of branching, obtained in “dry” and “wet” conditions were analyzed (Table 4). As a reference sample, a globular HPG sample was synthesized following a standard protocol.34 To generate fluorescently labeled polymer chains, PGs were functionalized with rhodamine B (RhB) via esterification of PG hydroxyls with RhB carboxylic acid. 1H and13C NMR, FTIR, UV–vis, and GPC characterization confirmed the RhB grafting. 1H NMR spectra of RhB-functionalized PG (RhB-PG) exhibited signals corresponding to RhB moieties significantly broadened in the aromatic region (Figure 7). Quantification of the amounts of RhB per hydroxyl group of PG by 1H NMR resulted in about 3 mol %. The formation of ester bonds was confirmed by 13C NMR and FTIR through a peak shift of the RhB C=O signal from 166.7 to 165.2 ppm after esterification (Figure S5), and a peak shift of the RhB C=O stretching band from 1706 to 1716 cm–1 (Figure S6). UV–vis detection in GPC experiments revealed a transition in the polymer absorbance from nonabsorbance to absorbance at 554 nm after functionalization (Figure S7). The UV–vis absorption band of RhB-grafted polymers exhibited a red shift in peak maxima from 554 (physical mixture of RhB and PG) to 560 nm in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) of pH 7.4 at 37 °C upon functionalization (Figure 8) in agreement with literature data.48 The position of this band remained unchanged for 24 h, indicating that RhB remained covalently attached to PGs for at least 24 h.

Then, hCMEC/D3 cells (used as a cellular model) were treated with different concentrations of RhB-PG for 24 h, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay.50 The results showed that RhB-PG doses of up to 100 μg mL–1 were well-tolerated by the tested endothelial cell line, as evidenced by cell viability exceeding 50% (Figure 9). A substantial reduction in cell viability was observed at a RhB-PG dose of 1000 μg mL–1. Overall, RhB-bcPG showed a less cytotoxic effect in comparison to the other PG structures. These results contrast with previous studies on LPG and HPG of low (∼6 kDa)14 and high (∼100 kDa)13 molecular weights, where no effect of the polymer topology on the cytotoxicity was found using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at polymer concentrations up to 10 mg mL–1.

In Vitro Endothelial Permeability

The influence of the topology of branched PGs on their ability to cross the BBB was assessed by using an in vitro transwell model made by hCMED/D3 (Figure 10a). This is the most utilized and known in vitro model to evaluate the ability of drugs, molecules, polymers, and nanoparticles to overcome a cell monolayer made by brain capillary endothelial cells.35 The results showed that the highest endothelial permeability (EP) was detected for RhB-HPG, in comparison to the other PGs tested (Figure 10b), suggesting that the topology of the polymers can affect the ability to cross a cell monolayer. We hypothesize that their different shapes and/or sizes in a water-enriched environment may affect their interaction with cell membranes and subsequently the EP. HPG exhibits a globular structure, unlike bcPG and bc+blPG, and bcPG is more compact (smaller Rg) than bc+blPG. Considering that size and shape are critical physical factors affecting BBB crossing,51 this aspect will be subjected to further investigation. The EP of free RhB was 2.91 × 10–2 cm/min, which was 100-fold higher than that of RhB-PGs. This result confirms that RhB was stably bound to PG, and the measured EP reflects the permeability of RhB-PGs.

(b) Endothelial permeability of RhB-PGs (different topology) calculated by measuring the fluorescence in the “brain” side compartment over time (up to 3 h, at 37 °C). 10 μg/mL of RhB-PG was added to the “blood” compartment. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of at least three independent measurements, each of which is in triplicate.

Finally, to check if the RhB-PG passage was between cell spaces or across the cells, confocal microscopy imaging was performed on hCMEC/D3 cells. The results (Figure 11) showed that all RhB-PGs were detected inside the cells, suggesting that BBB crossing occurred through the cells. A higher cellular uptake for RhB-HPG compared with the other PG structures was noticed, in agreement with the highest EP value found for RhB-HPG. Again, the PG conformation in a water-enriched environment may affect the interaction of the polymers with the cell membrane. Interestingly, RhB-bcPG was mainly localized around cell nuclei, unlike RhB-HPG which was not. RhB-bc+blPG also seems localized around the nuclei, although its detection was less clear. The results confirm the ability of PG structures to successfully cross the BBB, as those found for polymeric micellar nanocarriers of about 30 nm of diameter.52 Considering that our PG structures do not form micelles and that their diameters in water are only 3–4 nm (see Rg values in Figure 6), it is likely that the micrometer-size fluorescent spots detected in Figure 11 are due to their aggregation and accumulation within specific parts of the cell. Comparing the EP with functionalized nanoliposomes to cross the BBB (EP in the order of 10–5 cm/min),35 RhB-PGs showed higher values (EP in the order of 10–4 cm/min). While in vivo rodents are typically used to evaluate the biocompatibility, biodistribution, and potential toxicity of polymers, in vitro models are commonly used to predict the behavior of macromolecules, drugs, and polymers.53 PGs have previously been shown to exhibit minimal polymer accumulation in vital organs after intravenous injection compared to other polymers.3 In addition, they have been well tolerated in mice and rats with no evidence of immunogenicity reported to date. Our findings with an in vitro model open the possibility of using current PGs structures as brain delivery systems.

Figure 11 Confocal images showing the RhB-PG passage through the transwell model made by hCMED/D3. All RhB-PGs are inside the cell monolayer showing that BBB crossing occurs though the cells. RhB-HPG exhibits a higher cellular uptake compared to other PG structures. RhB-bcPG mainly localizes around the cell nuclei.

Conclusions

Under dry conditions, bcPG is obtained with topological purity. As the water content increases in the polymerization of glycidol with B(C6F5)3, there is a corresponding increase in the formation of blPG structures. The formation of cyclic species persisted even in the presence of a significant excess of water, confirming that cyclic chains are the thermodynamically favored product. Therefore, achieving topological purity for blPG was not feasible and only mixtures of bcPG and blPG (bc+blPG) structures could be obtained. This had important implications for the final properties of the products obtained under dry or wet conditions.

The structure and conformation of the PGs in solution were characterized by SAXS. A power-law scaling relationship between the radius of gyration and molar mass was obtained, yielding a fractal dimension of the order of two for PGs obtained under both dry and wet conditions, consistent with the formation of randomly branched structures and in contrast to the globular and compact nature of HPG. In addition, an Rg(wet)/Rg(dry) ratio of 1.14 was obtained, indicating that the pure bcPG formed under dry conditions is more compact than the mixture of bcPG and blPG structures obtained in the presence of water.

The differences in polymer shape or size may be the factor responsible for the different biological responses between HPG and bcPG. HPG showed higher endothelial permeability and cellular uptake compared with bcPG and bc+blPG. bcPG (and apparently bc+blPG) was localized around the cell nuclei, whereas HPG did not exhibit this behavior. Overall, bcPG showed a less cytotoxic effect compared to the other PG structures.

Our study demonstrates the importance of finely controlling the polymerization conditions of glycidol with B(C6F5)3 to minimize the unwanted presence of water, which can produce blPG structures that affect the biological activity of the topological analogue bcPG. Our results also suggest potential applications of PG structures in brain delivery systems and highlight the importance of polymer topology in the BBB crossing in vitro.
