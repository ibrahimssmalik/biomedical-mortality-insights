The bioavailability of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is vital for skeletal muscle health, yet the mechanisms or signals regulating NAD homeostasis remain unclear. Here, we uncover a pathway connecting peripheral glucose sensing to the modulation of muscle NAD through TAS1R2, the sugar-sensing G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) initially identified in taste perception. Muscle TAS1R2 receptor stimulation by glucose and other agonists induces ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation and activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase1 (PARP1), a major NAD consumer in skeletal muscle. Consequently, muscle-specific deletion of TAS1R2 (mKO) in male mice suppresses PARP1 activity, elevating NAD levels and enhancing mitochondrial capacity and running endurance. Plasma glucose levels negatively correlate with muscle NAD, and TAS1R2 receptor deficiency enhances NAD responses across the glycemic range, implicating TAS1R2 as a peripheral energy surveyor. These findings underscore the role of GPCR signaling in NAD regulation and propose TAS1R2 as a potential therapeutic target for maintaining muscle health.

The bioavailability of NAD is vital for muscle health. Here, the authors unveil a pathway from glucose sensing to muscle NAD modulation via the TAS1R2 receptor, suggesting TAS1R2 as a therapeutic target for muscle health preservation.

Skeletal muscle adapts to various environmental stimuli by coordinating mechanical, hormonal, neuronal, and metabolic pathways. These adaptations are essential for maintaining energy balance and regulating the delicate equilibrium between anabolic and catabolic processes. However, the decline of these mechanisms, often observed in aging and obesity, can result in muscle dysfunction. Central to this scenario is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), an endogenous metabolite that partakes in redox reactions and serves as a substrate for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and NAD-dependent deacetylases (sirtuins, SIRT)1. Depletion of cellular NAD is closely linked to skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunction2. Therefore, deciphering and intervening in the mechanisms that control NAD synthesis3–7 or consumption8–10 could restore or enhance muscle health. Notably, some of these mechanisms are influenced by signals originating from peripheral nutrient availability5,6, indicating the existence of nutrient-specific sensors.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating cellular functions by integrating signals from both extracellular and intracellular sources. Traditionally activated by hormones and neurotransmitters, an increasing number of specialized GPCRs have emerged that respond to nutrients or endogenous metabolites11. These unique GPCRs are distributed in tissues such as the tongue, intestine, and pancreas, where they directly sense energy substrates such as fatty acids, amino acids, or sugars. For instance, sugars like glucose activate sweet taste receptors (STR; TAS1R2/TAS1R3), leading to the release of ATP12, incretins13,14, or insulin15,16 in the corresponding tissues. Consequently, glucose, typically utilized for energy or the generation of regulatory metabolites once inside cells, can independently activate signaling cascades through cell-surface GPCRs. These observations raise the possibility of a broader nutrient-sensing role for this GPCR in other tissues relevant to metabolism. The TAS1R2 subunit of STR provides specificity for sugar sensing17,18, so to investigate this possibility, we used a Tas1r2-Cre promoter-driven Tdtomato reporter mouse (TdTas1r2+)19.

Using pharmacological and genetic approaches in vivo and in cell cultures in vitro, we show that Tas1r2/Tas1r3 are expressed in myofibers and sense ambient glucose to modulate NAD homeostasis. These effects are mediated by the activation of ERK1/2 and the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of PARP1, a main consumer of NAD. Consequently, TAS1R2 signaling inhibition in skeletal muscle increases NAD levels through the suppression of PARP1 activity, causing positive adaptations in muscle fitness.

Results

The Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 sweet taste receptors are expressed in skeletal muscle fibers

Assessment of tissues from the TdTas1r2+ reporter mouse showed active expression of Tas1r2 in skeletal muscles (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1a, b). Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 (heterodimeric subunits of STR) were found to be expressed in mouse skeletal muscles (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1c). Available STR antibodies lacked specificity, so to ensure that their expression was specific to myocytes, we used myogenin-Cre (MyoCre) mice crossed with HA-RiboTagfl/fl mice (HA-RiboTagMyo)20 to selectively immunoprecipitate mRNA from myocytes (skeletal myofibers) (Fig. S1d). We found that STR are specifically expressed in myofibers in vivo (Fig. 1c). Subsequent transcriptomics analysis, using myocyte-specific mRNA from the HA-RiboTagMyo muscles, indicated that Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 were among the 139 non-odorant GPCRs expressed in soleus myocytes (Fig. 1d). The mRNA levels of Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 were consistent with other expressed GPCRs in myocytes (Fig. 1e and Fig. S2). Consequently, we set to investigate possible contributions of STR-signaling in skeletal muscle function.Fig. 1 The Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 sweet taste GPCRs are expressed in skeletal muscle fibers.

TAS1R2-mediated glucose sensing regulates NAD levels coupled to PARP activity

Due to the involvement of TAS1R2 in glucose-sensing14,15, we conducted LC/MS-based targeted metabolomics in skeletal muscles of mice with genetic deletion of Tas1r2 (bKO) or controls (bWT)18. We found increased NAD levels in Tas1r2 ablated muscles, but the NAD precursors21, NAM and NMN, were similar (Fig. S3a,b). To interrogate muscle-autonomous regulatory mechanisms linked to TAS1R2 signaling, we generated mice with muscle-specific deletion of Tas1r2 (mKO) and wild type Tas1r2fl/fl littermate controls (mWT). In agreement with the LC/MS data, we found increased NAD levels in acidic extracts of mKO muscles compared to mWT controls (Fig. 2a) and in differentiated myocyte cultures derived from the same mice (Fig. S3c). Interestingly, the protein levels of phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) were similar in mWT and mKO muscles (Fig. 2b). NAMPT is the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD biosynthesis22, recycling NAM, liberated from NAD, to generate NMN21 (Fig. S3b). Taken together, these findings indicate that TAS1R2 signaling minimally influences the rate of NAD synthesis, suggesting that the increased NAD levels in TAS1R2-deficient muscles may result from a reduction in NAD consumption.Fig. 2 TAS1R2-mediated glucose sensing regulates NAD levels coupled to PARP activity.

In skeletal muscle, PARP1 is the primary consumer of NAD, utilizing it for protein poly(ADP)-ribosylation (PAR)1. Muscles lacking TAS1R2 displayed diminished PAR, with no observable changes in the protein levels of PARP1 or PARP2 (Fig. 2b). The nuclear PAR levels between 115–180 kDa were found to be specifically linked to PARP1 activity, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. S3d). We hypothesized that if TAS1R2 influences NAD levels through mechanisms independent of PARP1, the pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 with PJ34, a known enhancer of muscle NAD levels in mice9,10, would have an additive effect, further elevating NAD levels in mKO mice. PJ34 proportionally suppressed muscle PAR in both genotypes (Fig. 2c). However, while PARP1 inhibition caused an anticipated increase in muscle NAD in mWT mice10, it failed to further elevate NAD in mKO muscles (Fig. 2d). Thus, reduced PARP1 activity in mKO muscles was sufficient to maximize NAD levels, suggesting that TAS1R2-mediated NAD regulation is coupled, at least in part, to PARP1 activity.

NAD levels in skeletal muscle respond to changes in glucose or energy availability5,6. The fact that glucose, the main circulating sugar, is a bona fide TAS1R2 agonist, suggested a physiological link between glycemia and muscle NAD regulation. To test this hypothesis, we acutely stimulated TAS1R2 using glucose or 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG), a glucose analogue that cannot be metabolized but exhibits the same TAS1R2 affinity as glucose23,24. C2C12 cells treated with high glucose or 3-OMG for 6 h exhibited decreased NAD levels (Fig. 2e) and increased PARP1 activity (Fig. 2f) compared to low glucose control. Importantly, the NAD-lowering effect of 3-OMG was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of TAS1R2/TAS1R3 (gurmarin) or PARP1 (PJ34) (Fig. 2g). While differentiated myocyte cultures from mKO muscles exhibited elevated NAD levels compared to mWT cultures (Fig. S3c), stimulation of primary mWT myocytes with glucose did not consistently alter NAD levels. Further investigation is required to elucidate the physiological factors contributing to the NAD insensitivity to glucose manipulations in primary myocytes.

To assess the physiological relevance of the TAS1R2-PARP1-NAD axis in vivo, we subjected mice to fasting and refeeding to induce rapid changes in glycemia (Fig. S3e). Regardless of the feeding state, mKO muscles exhibited higher NAD levels (Fig. 2h) and lower PARP activity (Fig. 2i) than mWT muscles. Refeeding proportionally suppressed muscle NAD levels in both genotypes (Fig. 2h). In contrast, PARP activity increased with feeding in mWT muscles but remained unchanged in TAS1R2-deficient mKO muscles (Fig. 2i), indicating that the modulation of PARP activity in response to glycemia fluctuations relies on functional TAS1R2 signaling. Considering that the TAS1R2 receptor in skeletal muscle is consistently exposed to circulating glucose, we examined and identified a negative correlation between plasma glucose levels and muscle NAD levels in both mWT and mKO mice (Fig. 2j), consistent with the responses observed during fasting and refeeding. Notably, the deficiency of TAS1R2 signaling in mKO muscles amplified NAD responses across the glycemic range, indicating a TAS1R2-dependent regulatory component. Taken together, these findings support a putative link between glucose-induced activation of TAS1R2-PARP1 axis and the regulation of NAD consumption in muscle cells.

TAS1R2 activates an ERK2-PARP1 signaling axis in skeletal muscle

In neurons, ERK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate PARP125–27 independent from DNA damage28. Since ERK1/2 is a downstream mediator of TAS1R2/TAS1R3 signaling29, we investigated its contribution to the regulation of PARP1 activity in skeletal muscle. The general ERK1/2 inducer, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), increased PARP activity in C2C12 cells (Fig. S4a), suggesting that, like in neurons, ERK1/2 activation can modulate PARP activity in muscle cells. Acute stimulation of TAS1R2 in vivo through intramuscular injections of sucralose or 3-OMG led to rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in mWT, but not in mKO muscles (Fig. S4b, c), suggesting the presence of a TAS1R2-ERK1/2 signaling axis in skeletal muscle. To further elucidate the specificity of TAS1R2 signaling cascade, we engineered mice with transgenic expression of the human TAS1R2 receptor in the muscles of mKO mice (mTg) and used aspartame, a human-specific TAS1R2 agonist that the mouse TAS1R2 receptor cannot sense30. Aspartame injection stimulated ERK1/2 in “humanized” TAS1R2 mTg muscles but not in mWT muscles expressing native mouse TAS1R2 (Fig. 3a). The induction of ERK2 was substantially stronger than ERK1 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where PARP1 is located (Fig. 3a). Indeed, ERK2, but not ERK1, co-immunoprecipitated with PARP1 in muscle nuclear isolates, indicating an interaction (Fig. S4d). In neurons, ERK2 directly phosphorylates PARP1 at the S372/T373 residues25. Consequently, ERK2-mediated PARP1 phosphorylation (p-PARP1) and activity (PAR) was increased in muscles from aspartame-dosed mTg mice (Fig. 3b), as detected by an ERK2-specific phospho-PARP1 antibody (Fig. S4d). In contrast, treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF), which robustly activates ERK1/2 through the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, did not affect PARP1 phosphorylation or activity in skeletal muscle (Fig. S4e), suggesting specificity of the ERK2-PARP1 axis to TAS1R2 signaling. To determine whether the robust stimulation of TAS1R2 signaling by aspartame can also impact NAD levels in vivo, fasted mWT and mTg mice were subjected to repeated ip. injections of saline or aspartame. Aspartame treatment caused a substantial drop in NAD levels in mTg mice, but aspartame-insensitive mWT mice remained unresponsive (Fig. 3c and Fig. S4f). These findings corroborate the physiological relevance of glucose-induced stimulation of TAS1R2-NAD axis (Fig. 2h–j) and demonstrate that direct stimulation of TAS1R2 in vivo is causatively linked to muscle NAD regulation. Like in muscles in vivo, sucralose activated pERK2 and proportionally increased PAR in C2C12 muscle cells (Fig. 3d, e), but ERK1/2 inhibition with 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (PD98059; PD) (Fig. S4g) blocked sucralose-induced PARP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3d, f) and activity (Fig. 3d, g). These findings suggest that STR signaling in skeletal muscle modulates PARP1 activity, at least in part, through ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3h).Fig. 3 TAS1R2 activates the ERK2-PARP1 axis in skeletal muscle.

TAS1R2 regulates skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity and fitness

Increased NAD in skeletal muscle activates the SIRT1-PGC1α axis causing beneficial adaptations in mitochondria9. Total acetylation was similar between genotypes (Fig. S5a), but we found reduced PGC1α acetylation (Fig. 4a, b). Taken together with the elevated NAD levels, these findings are indicative of increased SIRT1 activity in mKO muscles. Next, we tested possible effects of the NAD-SIRT1-PGC1α activation on mitochondria content and function. Transmission electron microscopy revealed higher mitochondrial density in myofibers of mKO mice (Fig.4c) and immunoblotting showed elevated levels of electron transport chain (ETC) proteins (Fig. 4d). Consequently, mKO myofibers displayed increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity compared to mWT controls (Fig. 4e). Given the substantial effects on mitochondrial function, we tested the running capacity of mice and found higher endurance in mKO mice (Fig. 4f). These phenotypic adaptations cannot be attributed to differences in body size or growth (Fig. S5b–d), glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity (Fig. S5e–h), or other secondary effects associated with energy balance and activity (Fig.S5i–l). Collectively, this data indicates that the increased NAD levels resulting from the inhibition of PARP1 activity in TAS1R2-deficient muscles (mKO) contribute to noteworthy functional adaptations in mitochondria and overall muscle fitness (Fig. 4g).Fig. 4 TAS1R2 regulates skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity.

Discussion

All cells possess glucose-sensing mechanisms that link energy availability to cellular processes governing homeostasis. Typically, these mechanisms rely on glucose uptake and subsequent transformation into metabolites detectable by intracellular sensors31. In this study, we elucidate the relationship between glucose sensing and NAD homeostasis in skeletal muscle, emphasizing the critical role of TAS1R2, the GPCR traditionally associated with sweet taste perception17. Our findings reveal that TAS1R2 directly regulates NAD levels, underscoring its significance in linking peripheral energy availability to cellular processes controlling homeostasis.

We demonstrate the expression of Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 in myofibers, suggesting that sweet taste receptors have a biological function in skeletal muscle. Importantly, their expression levels align with other relevant GPCRs, indicating a functional role in sensing and responding to circulating energy substrates. Using various agonists, we show that activation of TAS1R2 signaling negatively regulates NAD levels by increasing PARP1 activity. In skeletal muscle, PARP1 is the primary consumer of NAD, utilizing it for protein poly(ADP)-ribosylation (PAR)1. Consequently, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of TAS1R2 attenuates PARP1 activity, causing sustained increases in NAD levels. Mechanisms or strategies that boost NAD levels can induce beneficial adaptations in skeletal muscle32. In part, this is because NAD is also a substrate for SIRT1, so lowering PARP1 activity can redirect NAD toward SIRT1-mediated utilization21. We found increased SIRT1 activity in mKO muscles associated with beneficial adaptations in mitochondrial capacity and running endurance. These findings demonstrate that elevated NAD levels in TAS1R2 deficient muscles can translate into significant physiological adaptations. Direct inhibition of PARP1, the downstream effector of TAS1R2 signaling, also activates the NAD-SIRT1 axis leading to similar beneficial effects, including mitochondrial content and function, and running endurance9,10. However, these studies targeting PARP1 inhibition did not demonstrate or propose any physiological context or molecular signal that mediates these responses9,10. Therefore, TAS1R2 and PARP1 loss-of-function in mice display similar phenotypic attributes, further corroborating a functional coupling between TAS1R2 and PARP1 activity. The adaptive effects resulting from TAS1R2 deficiency in skeletal muscle are comparable to other approaches that positively affect NAD levels, such as NAD precursor supplementation2,3,33 or exercise training4,6,34,35, all directed towards promoting NAD synthesis. However, enhancing NAD synthesis through NAMPT overexpression in skeletal muscle proved insufficient to promote mitochondrial adaptations36, suggesting a dynamic interplay between complex mechanisms that control NAD bioavailability. In light of this, the adaptations observed in our mouse models imply that regulating NAD consumption might yield greater benefits for skeletal muscle than solely focusing on promoting its synthesis.

Most notably, our study establishes TAS1R2 as a glucose-sensing GPCR with independent influence on NAD levels in skeletal muscle. Fluctuations in ambient glucose induced by fasting-refeeding cycles or glucose restriction are traditionally associated with changes in NAD biosynthesis, underscoring an intimate link between energy availability and the modulation of NAD homeostasis5,6. These effects have been attributed to shifts in energy metabolism and the activation of intracellular energy sensors that depends on nutrient metabolism. However, our findings suggest that TAS1R2-mediated glucose sensing can independently alter NAD levels through extracellular energy sensing. This is particularly relevant given that the physiological range of blood glucose concentrations aligns with the affinity values of glucose for TAS1R237. Therefore, in addition to the modulation of NAD synthesis by metabolic sensors through the transcriptional regulation of NAMPT5,6, TAS1R2 receptor-mediated glucose sensing concurrently targets NAD consumption through the regulation of PARP1 activity. Targeting NAD synthesis and consumption through two distinct mechanisms, one relying on glucose uptake and metabolism6 and the other on receptor-mediated peripheral glucose sensing, may be necessary for critical adjustments of the NAD pool accompanying large energy or nutrient shifts. Considering that intracellular energy sensors, such as AMPK6,35, can be equally influenced by the metabolism of glucose or any other macronutrient, a mechanism involving nutrient-specific GPCR signaling can be rapidly deployed following changes in the circulating concentrations of the corresponding nutrient. This may confer a physiological advantage for the modulation of NAD that depends on both general energy cues and nutrient-specific ones. Although this notion requires further investigation, skeletal muscle also expresses GPCRs that sense fatty acids38 and amino acids39 which may contribute to this or other relevant sensory processes.

Another finding of our studies is the identification of an ERK1/2-PARP1 signaling axis in skeletal muscle. Specifically, ERK1/2 activation downstream of TAS1R2 stimulation directly phosphorylates and activates PARP1, leading to NAD utilization. ERK1/2 have been implicated in the regulation of skeletal muscle maintenance40 or development41, but their direct effects on muscle bioenergetics are unclear42. The ERK2-PARP1 axis was shown to be selective, as robust activation of ERK1/2 through the EGF tyrosine kinase receptor had no effect on PARP1 phosphorylation of activity. Therefore, the selective interaction between ERK1/2 and PARP1 underscores the specificity of the TAS1R2 signaling cascade in skeletal muscle in response to relevant extracellular stimuli. This concept is aligned with previous reports showing that receptor-mediated amino acid sensing in skeletal muscle regulates mTORC1 through ERK1/2 signaling39,43. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that myocytes integrate GPCR-dependent signals derived for all classes of circulating macronutrients.

In summary, our study uncovers a GPCR-dependent signaling mechanism that fine tunes skeletal muscle NAD bioavailability in response to changes in extracellular glucose. We postulate that TAS1R2 may function as a peripheral energy surveyor, conveying signals to myocytes about shifts in energy availability. Consequently, chronic TAS1R2 deficiency is likely perceived as prolonged energy deprivation eliciting NAD-dependent adaptations akin to those observed under similar conditions1. This mechanism offers insights into the intricate interplay between nutrient sensing and cellular adaptations and unveils possible therapeutic approaches. Given that GPCRs are established targets for pharmacological interventions44, the inhibition of TAS1R2 receptor could benefit individuals with compromised muscle health.

Mice were housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to water and standard diet. Male mice were used for experimental purposes only after reaching sexual maturity at 12-16 weeks of age unless otherwise stated.

Tas1r2 floxed mice (Tas1r2fl/fl) were generated from the KOMP Repository (#CSD25803). Tas1r2 iCre knock in mice (Tas1r2iCre) were previously generated as described19. Human TAS1R2 transgenic mice (hTAS1R2fl-stop) were created by InGenious Targeting Laboratory (Ronkonkoma, NY) by placing a cDNA cassette containing a synthetic CAG promoter, a floxed NEO stop cassette, the consensus human TAS1R2 cDNA, an IRES-EGFP, and a BGH polyA on the mouse ROSA26 locus. Whole body Tas1r2 knockout mice (bKO) were a gift from Dr. Zuker18. Myogenin-Cre mice (MyoCre) were a gift from Dr. Olson45. The above mouse lines (hTAS1R2fl-stop, Tas1r2fl/fl, Tas1r2iCre, and MyoCre) were backcrossed and then maintained to pure C57BL6/6 J strain (using Jax# 000664). RiboTag-Rpl22fl/fl-HA (RiboTagfl/fl) (Jax# 029977) and tdTomato mice (Tdfl/fl) (Jax#007914) were obtained from the Jackson Lab (Bar Harbor, ME).

Tdfl/fl mice were crossed with Tas1r2iCre mice to generate mice (TdTas1r2) that express Tdtomato in Tas1r2 positive cells19. RiboTagfl/fl mice were crossed with MyoCre mice to generate mice (HA-RiboTagMyo) that express Rpl22-HA in myogenin-positive cells (myocytes).

Tas1r2fl/fl mice were crossed with MyoCre mice to generate mice (mKO) with muscle-specific deletion of Tas1r2. mKO mice were crossed with hTAS1R2fl-stop mice to generate mice (mTg) with muscle-specific transgenic overexpression of human TAS1R2 without endogenous Tas1r2. We used a specific breeding scheme to obtain wild-type control (mWT), mKO, and mTg congenic littermates: Congenic male mice carrying one MyoCre allele, one hTAS1R2fl-stop allele and two Tas1r2fl/fl alleles were crossed with congenic female mice carrying two Tas1r2fl/fl alleles. Male offspring carrying two Tas1r2fl/fl alleles were used as wild-type controls (mWT). Male offspring carrying one MyoCre allele and two (floxed out) Tas1r2fl/fl alleles were used for muscle-specific genetic deletion of Tas1r2 gene (mKO). Male offspring carrying one MyoCre allele, two (floxed out) Tas1r2fl/fl alleles, and one (floxed STOP) hTAS1R2fl-stop allele were used as muscle-specific transgenic expression of hTAS1R2 gene without the endogenous mouse Tas1r2 gene (mTg).

Mouse genotyping

Mice were ear-punched at weaning and punches were digested with 100 µL of 50 mM NaOH for 1 h at 95 °C. Samples were then cooled at room temperature, spun, and neutralized with 20 µL of 1 M Tris pH8 and 100μL of water. Clear homogenates were subsequently genotyped by PCR and electrophoresis using specific primers. Primer sequences and genotyping details can be found in the Supplementary Information.

Mouse in vivo treatments

PJ34 treatment: Administration of 10 mg/kg PJ34 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) was performed IP twice a day for 5 days before the tissue harvest. Sweetener injections: For intramuscular sweetener injections, 5 h fasted mice were anesthetized with 165 mg/kg pentobarbital (Sagent, Schaumburg, IL) and 10μL of sucralose (100 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 3-o-methylglucose (30 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), or aspartame (5 mM) (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) were injected with a 20μL Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) in the vastus medial using the contralateral leg as saline-injected control. Muscles were dissected exactly 10 min after each injection and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fast/refed treatment: Mice were divided into cohorts of 4 mice and randomized between fasted and refed. Each day, a cohort was fasted starting 7am for a total of 24 h. Mice were kept fasted or were refed in a staggered fashion, so each harvest was performed exactly 2 h after the additional fasting or refeeding. Aspartame treatment: Mice were divided into cohorts of 4 mice and randomized between Saline and Aspartame. Each cohort was fasted for 20 h and mice were then injected IP with 200 μL saline (Pfizer, New York, NY) or 200μL of 7.5 mg/ml aspartame (60 mg/kg) (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). Mice were injected six times (360 mg/mg aspartame) spanning a 4 h period and harvested right after.

Harvest and tissue processing

All harvests were performed between 1 pm and 2 pm after a 5 h fast, unless otherwise stated. All tissues were collected in vivo under 165 mg/kg pentobarbital anesthesia (Sagent, Schaumburg, IL) using heat pads to sustain body temperature. Muscles were harvested tendon to tendon starting with the left leg and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples for RNA extraction were stored at -80 °C until use. Samples for protein determination and metabolomics were lyophilized overnight at -50 °C and 0.5mbar and then pulverized in 2 ml Sarstedt tubes (Newton, NC) containing 2 RNase-free plastic beads (OMNI, Kennesaw GA) in a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Rockville, MD) at 0 °C × 7200RPM × 20 s × 15 s pause × 3 cycles.

Primary myocyte isolation and culture

Mouse hindlimb muscles were dissected in PBS (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), sliced into 1 mm pieces in HBSS (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and digested for 45 min at 37 °C using 400U/ml collagenase (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and 0.08 U/ml dispase II (Roche, Germany). Tissues were then triturated by aspiration with a 1 ml pipette and incubated for additional 45 min before the reaction was stopped by addition of pre-warmed pre-plating medium (PPM), consisting of 90% low glucose DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 10% FBS, 1x glutamax, 1% penn-strep (all Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cells were strained, spun at 300 g, re-suspended in PPM, and incubated into a 100 mm tissue dish for 3 h. Myoblasts were then released from the culture dish by gentle agitation leaving the adherent fibroblasts behind and the medium was spun at 300 g. Pelleted cells were re-suspended in growth medium (GM), consisting of 80% Ham’s F-10, 20% FBS, 1x Glutamax (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 2.5 ng/ml bFGF, 10 ng/μL EGF, 1ug/ml insulin, 0.39 mg/ml dexamethasone (all Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 1% penn-strep (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cells were incubated on collagen-coated T25 flasks, and expanded for 5-6 days until clusters of 2-5 cells appeared. Cells were then purified for a second time (trypsinized in 1:1 PBS, pre-plated with PPM, separated from fibroblasts by agitation, spun at 300 g, resuspended in GM) and expanded from T25 to T75 flasks. Cells were differentiated at passage 6 by seeding 50000 cells into collagen-coated 24-well plates and switching to differentiation media (DM), consisting of 98% high glucose DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 2% horse serum, 1x Glutamax, 1% pen-strep (all Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) 24 h after. NAD was determined after 6 days of differentiation.

C2C12 culture and studies

C2C12 (ATCC CRL-1772) were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Penn/Strep (all Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) using 75cm2 flasks. Cells were passaged in 24-well plates for NAD or 6-well plates for signaling studies at a density of 52632 cells/cm2 and media was changed to high glucose DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) with 2% horse serum and 1% Penn/Strep (all Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) upon confluence to start differentiation. For the assessment of NAD cells were switched to 5 mM glucose DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) 2% horse serum and 1% Penn/Strep at day 4 of differentiation (all Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). After 2 days, the acute effects of adding glucose (20 mM) (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 3-o-methylglucose (20 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), PJ-34 (1uM) (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) or gurmarin (30ug/ml) (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA) were evaluated by spiking stock volumes in the wells for 6 h before harvesting. For signaling experiments, C2C12 cells at day 6 of differentiation were equilibrated in EBSS (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 10 min and subsequently incubated with 2x stocks in EBSS to achieve 10 mM sucralose (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 10μM PD98059 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), 10 ng/ml EGF (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), or 0.1 mM PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO).

Oxygen consumption in isolated fibers and primary cultures

Measurement of mitochondrial function (oxygen consumption) in muscle fibers and cells was performed as described46. Oxygen consumption in saponin-permealized fibers was performed using Oxygraph 2 K (Oroboros, Austria). Maximal respiration supported by electron flux was measured with the addition of ADP (500 mM) after stabilization on saturating pyruvate-malate (2 M). Steady-state O2 flux for was determined and normalized to fiber dry weight using Datlab 6 software (Oroboros).

Mouse body metrics (podikometry)

Body composition was measured in duplicate using an EchoMRI instrument, calibrated daily with 40.5 g of canola oil, and percent composition was calculated after subtraction of free water. Body length and tibia length were measured at harvest using pre-calibrated Traceable digital calipers (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Liver weight was measured immediately during the dissection with a 0.1 mg precision.

Glucose and insulin homeostasis

Glucose tolerance tests were performed intraperitoneally (i.p.GTT) or intragastrically (ig.GTT) with 1 g/kg glucose in 5 h fasted mice. Insulin tolerance test (ITT) was assessed in 5 h fasted mice with 0.5U/kg insulin (Humulin R U-100; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN). Plasma glucose was measured from the tail vein using AlphaTRAK 2 glucometers (Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ). Plasma glucose and insulin was measured in ad libitum mice (9am). For insulin measurement, blood was collected and centrifuged immediately at 2000g in EDTA-treated tubes and analyzed via ELISA (ChrystalChem ultrasensitive insulin kit; Elk Grove Village, IL). The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was calculated as the inverse of the sum of the logarithms of insulin (μU/ml) and glucose (mg/dL).

Energy balance and activity

An automated phenotyping homecage system (TSE PhenoMaster; TSE Systems, Germany) was used to perform behavioral and metabolic tests in single-caged mice. Phenotypic measurements of activity, food, and water intake and expired O2 and CO2 were performed ad libitum in cohorts of male mWT and mKO mice. RER and expenditure were automatically calculated from the software (TSE PhenoMaster 15.7.6.2) using the values of expired gases. Data was analyzed by regression following standardized guidelines using jamovi 2.2.547.

Running endurance (treadmill)

Running endurance was performed between 12 and 2 p.m. in 5 h fasted male mice using an Exer 6 treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus OH). All mice were accustomed to the treadmill for at least 2 sessions of acclimatization. Endurance was tested with a constant intensity protocol, consisting of 5 min–0°–10 m/min, 5 min–0°–20 m/min, and then 10°–20 m/min until exhaustion.

RNA isolation, gene expression and analysis

Frozen tissue samples were homogenized with 1 mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 3 2.8 mm plastic beads (OMNI, Kennesaw GA), and 1 0.05 mL scoop of 0.05 mm glass beads (Next Advance, Troy, NY) at 0 °C × 6800RPM × 20 s × 10s pause × 9 cycles. Homogenization was repeated 5 times. Samples were separated from beads and mixed with 200 µL of chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) in 1.5 mL tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000g × 4 °C × 15 min. Clear phase was separated, and ethanol (200 proof; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added 1:1 with clear phase. A Zymo Research Direct-zol RNA Microprep kit (Irvine, CA) was used for purification. RNA concentration was measured using NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). 1μg RNA was reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). cDNA was brought to 100μL and 2μL of sample per well was used in real time PCR using SYBR chemistry (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The cycle thresholds were compared to the Rn18s gene and gene expression was expressed in arbitrary units as 2-ΔCt. Primer sequences can be found in the Supplementary Information.

Ribotag RNA isolation and analysis

Muscle samples of RiboTagMyo mice were harvested, washed in PBS with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were pulverized and homogenized in 1 mL of cold polysome buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl, 200 mM KCl; all Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; 2 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide; all Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA) using 2 mL Dounce homogenizer (Wilmad, Vineland, NJ). Homogenates were transferred to a 1.5 ml RNase-free tube and centrifuged at 17,000 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min. The supernatant was brought to a fresh 1.5 mL tube and 100μL of sample was saved as input. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 4 μL of anti-hemagglutinin antibody for 3–6 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. 50 μL of AG Magnetic Beads (Pierce-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were washed 5 times with polysome buffer, re-suspended into 50 μL of polysome buffer, and added to the samples. Following overnight rotation, the samples were placed on a magnetic rack and washed 5x with 500 μL of high salt buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl, 300 mM KCl; all Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; 2 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100; all Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA) before elution with 300 μL of TRIzol (Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of ethanol and RNA was immediately extracted using a purification kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Reverse transcription and real time PCR were performed thereafter with our standard protocol. Gene enrichment was calculated as the ratio between elution and input expression. Associations with cell markers were evaluated through principal component analysis of eluate gene expressions after normalization with Rn18s.

Transcriptomics

RNA eluates from RiboTagMyo muscle tissue pulldown were send to the OSU Genomics Core for transcriptomic profiling using an Affymetrix mouse Clariom S hybridization array (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Samples were processed per the manufacturer’s protocol for a Clariom S Pico assay after a quality and quantity control with an Agilent TapeStation 4200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and a NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The resulting hybridization intensities were processed with Transcriptome Analysis Console 4.0 using the default configuration over the Clariom S Mouse updated transcript version 2.

Immunohistochemistry and tissue fluorescence

For TdTomato tissue fluorescence, muscles were cryo-protected in 30% sucrose overnight, then frozen in OCT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), sectioned, mounted (Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and imaged using Zeiss LSM 900 confocal (Zeiss, Germany) with a 581 nm filter and Zen 3.0 Zeiss Confocal software.

Electron Microscopy

Transmission electron microscopy imaging of muscle samples was performed by the OSU imaging core. Soleus samples were specially chosen for their fast fixation, thus preserving mitochondrial ultrastructure. Samples were dissected and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Samples were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and then en bloc stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in Eponate 12 epoxy resin (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA). Ultrathin sections were cut with a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica microsystems Inc., Deerfield, IL) and collected on copper grids. Images were acquired with an FEI Technai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) operating at 80 kV, and a Macrofire (Optronics, Inc., Chelmsford, MA) digital camera and AMT image capture software. For random sampling during imaging, at least 3 myofibers per subject were identified and then each was imaged in at least 4 random locations. The process was repeated at 11500x and 34000x.

NAD cyclic assay

NAD was determined by a cycling assay based on alcohol dehydrogenase after the acidic destruction of NADH48. 500μL of ice-cold 0.6 M perchloric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) was added to pelleted cells or to 2-3 mg of lyophilized tissue placed in 500μL skirted tubes with 5 mg of glass beads (Next Advance, Troy, NY). Samples were homogenized at 0 °C in a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Rockville, MD) with 3 cycles of shaking at 7200RPM × 20 s and 15 s pause, repeated 4 times. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12000 g during 20 min and 4 °C, and 300μL of acidic extract was saved in a new ice-cold 1.5 ml tube and the acidic pellet was saved for protein determination. Samples were then diluted 1:10 (cells) or 1:100 (tissues) with 100 mM PBS (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) right before starting the assay. The assay was performed in triplicate in black opaque 96 well plates containing 5μL of sample and standards and 95μL of freshly-made cycling assay. The cycling assay consisted on 100 mM PBS (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 0.1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 10 mM NAM (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 2% ethanol (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 10μM FMN, 20μM resazurin, 100μg/μL ADH, 10ug/ml diaphorase (all from Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). Fluorescence was recorded at 530/590 for 30 min. NAD from muscle samples was normalized by mg of dry tissue. For cell determinations, the total protein per well was used to normalize NAD. The acidic cell pellet was centrifuged again at 12000 g during 20 min and 4 °C and any remaining supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then neutralized with 50μL 1 M NaOH and homogenated at 7200RPM x 20 s three times or until solubilization. The basic homogenate was then spun and neutralized with 250μL 100 mM PBS before measuring protein with a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Muscle metabolomics

Targeted, quantitative metabolomics for nucleotides were performed from lyophilized gastrocnemius muscle as previously described49–51.

Protein extraction

4–6 mg of lyophilized powdered tissue was weighed in 2 ml Sarstedt tubes and protein was extracted with 200μL of RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Germany). Samples were placed 10 min on ice and then homogenized with 3 cycles of shaking at 7200RPM × 20 s and 15 s pause in a Precellys (Bertin Technologies, Rockville, MD). After spinning at 12000 g during 30 min, supernatants were placed in new tubes and protein was measured immediately with a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Samples were then brought to 2 mg/ml with supplemented RIPA buffer and 6x reducing buffer (Alfa Aesar- Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stored at −20 °C if not used immediately.

Immunoblotting

Samples were heated for 10 min at either 65 °C (samples probed for parylation or mitochondrial proteins) or 85 °C and 10–30μg of protein per lane was loaded into standard 7-10% reducing acrylamide gels for electrophoresis. Protein transfer onto PVDF (for mitochondrial proteins) or nitrocellulose membrane was performed in Towbin buffer at 100 V for 90 min inside a cold 4 °C room. After the transfer, blots were Ponceau-stained, cut into pieces to match the molecular weight of a target and a housekeeping protein, de-stained, and blocked with 5% dehydrated milk (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in TBST buffer. Blots were then probed overnight at 4 °C with corresponding primary antibodies and continuous rocking. After 3 washes in TBST, blots were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies, washed again and visualized with SuperSignal reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system. Antibody details and blot scans can be found in Supplementary Information.

Nuclear isolation

Lyophilized, pulverized muscle powder (12–15 mg) was resuspended in 300 μL PBS containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Germany), and was homogenized via dounce homogenizer. Homogenate was centrifuged at 1900 × g, 4 °C for 15 min, and supernatant was isolated as cytosolic fraction. The pellet was further treated with proprietary solutions for nuclear isolation (NE-PER, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), as follows. CER I buffer and NER buffer were supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Germany). The pellet was resuspended in 150 μL CER I buffer and incubated 10 min on ice. Buffer CER II (8.25 μL) was added to each sample, incubated 1 min on ice, then centrifuged at 16,000 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Supernatant was collected and added to the cytosolic fraction. Pellet was resuspended in 75 μL NER and incubated on ice for 40 min, with vortexing every 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g, 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as a nuclear fraction. Sample protein concentration was determined via BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Immunoprecipitation

Protein samples (450 μg of each) were diluted to 1 μg/μL in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Germany). To pre-clear samples, 50 μL Protein A/G-conjugated magnetic beads (Pierce-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were added to each sample and incubated for 60 min at 4 C while rotating. Beads and supernatant were separated magnetically, and 50 μL of supernatant was isolated as an input sample. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 4 μL PARP antibody overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Protein A/G-conjugated beads (50 μL) were added to each sample and incubated at 4 °C for 2 hours. Beads and supernatant were separated magnetically, and supernatant was discarded. Beads were washed 5X in 500 μL cold RIPA with inhibitors. SDS 6X reducing buffer (Alfa Aesar- Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added (15 μL) and samples were incubated at 65 °C for 8 min to elute protein, after which 15 μL RIPA with inhibitors was added and protein samples were magnetically separated from beads.

Schematics and diagrams

Schematics and diagrams were created using BioRender (Science Suite Inc.).

Statistics

Inferential statistics were performed by null hypothesis significance testing at a significance level of 0.05 using GraphPad Prism 9. Two-tailed tests were systematically employed throughout to infer a difference against the null. Planned comparisons between two groups were analyzed by t-tests. Planned comparisons within 2-factor designs were Šidák corrected after ANOVA, except two western blot experiments run in multiple gels where t-tests were employed. Linear regressions were performed to either test for a significant association between variables (significant slope) or to compare adjusted means between two groups (significant intercept).
