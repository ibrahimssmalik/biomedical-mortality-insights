==== Body
pmcWe read with great interest the recent article by Lee et al.1 on the performance of the MIC test strip (ETEST), automated AST card (Vitek 2) and Sensititre broth microdilution (BMD) in determining carbapenem susceptibility and MIC values for NDM-producing Enterobacterales. We applaud the authors for providing further evidence of suboptimal test performance of these challenging-to-treat bacteria across several clinically utilized susceptibility testing modalities. However it is unfortunate that this study did not evaluate or acknowledge the impact of an important contributor to this variability, namely zinc concentrations in each medium.

A number of studies over several decades have shown that the type of medium can have a profound effect on MICs and susceptibility patterns of bacteria based on (i) species (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa), (ii) resistance mechanism (e.g. MBL) and (iii) mechanism of action of the antimicrobial agent (e.g. colistin/polymyxin B, daptomycin, tigecycline, cefiderocol).2–7

Unlike the requirement for cation-adjusted Mueller–Hinton broth to have specific concentration ranges for calcium and magnesium, the concentrations of zinc are not specified or regulated. Therefore, for a study to assess performance or compare β-lactam susceptibility of MBL-producing isolates between tests that involve different media, consideration of zinc concentrations should be included to contextualize the study results. In this case, the dependence of MBL hydrolysis on zinc cations can lead to variability in MICs based on differences in the zinc concentrations in the testing media. Indeed, up to 10-fold differences in zinc concentrations have been observed in the broth of several automated susceptibility testing platforms (Vitek, MicroScan, BD Phoenix and Sensititre), whereas 4-fold differences in zinc concentrations have been observed in commercial broth routinely used for manual broth microdilution (Becton Dickinson, Oxoid and Sigma-Aldrich).8,9

In addition, we have shown that different lots of Mueller–Hinton broth even from the same manufacturer can result in different MICs and susceptibility categories of MBL-harbouring Enterobacterales.9 This latter finding could also be relevant to the study by Lee et al., given that the details of the Muller–Hinton agar (MHA) plates on which the Etests were placed for testing were not provided. If several brands or the same brand but different lots were indeed used that can also introduce variability in assessing Etest assay performance as it has been shown that the concentrations of cations in MHA also vary.3,10

In conclusion, differences in testing performance across media types and lots is not unexpected when MBLs are involved, and to further elucidate sources of variability, future studies would need to examine media and cation composition.
