In the originally published version of the manuscript there were two errors in the legend to Figure 1. This should read: “(A) Venous phase computed tomography (CT) […]” and “(B) Axial computed tomography (CT) […]” instead of: “(A) Triphasic computed tomography (CT) […]” and “(B) sagittal computed tomography (CT) […]”.

The emendations have been made to the article.
