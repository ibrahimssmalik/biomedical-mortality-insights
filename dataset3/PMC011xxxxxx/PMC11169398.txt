Glioblastoma is a rare and deadly malignancy with a low survival rate. Emerging evidence has shown that aberrantly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a critical role in the initiation and progression of GBM tumorigenesis. The oncogenic function of circZNF609 and circNFIX is involved in several types of cancer, but the role and underlying mechanism of these circRNAs in glioblastoma remain unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that circZNF609 and circNFIX may regulate EGFR through sponging miR-145-5p. Herein, we assessed the expression levels of circZNF609, circNFIX, miR-145-5p, and EGFR using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in glioblastoma patients and normal brain samples. The results showed that circZNF609, circNFIX, and EGFR expression levels were upregulated and miR145-5p was downregulated (p = 0.001, 0.06, 0.002, and 0.0065, respectively), while there was no significant association between clinicopathological features of the patients and the level of these genes expression. We also found a significant inverse correlation between miR145-5p and the expression of cZNF609, cNFIX and EGFR (p = 0.0003, 0.0006, and 0.009, respectively). These findings may open a new window for researchers to better understand the potential pathways involved in GBM pathogenesis. In conclusion, it may provide a new potential pathway for the development of effective drugs for the treatment of GBM patients.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a grade IV glioma according to the 2021 WHO classification and is the most aggressive and lethal primary malignancy of the central nervous system1. Despite recent advances in exploring novel therapeutic approaches for GBM, the outcomes of most patients are unfavorable2. The median survival from initial diagnosis is less than 15 months with treatment. Thus, further understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is needed to help develop effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of GBM3.

Recently, a growing number of studies have shown that circular RNA (circRNA) plays an important regulatory role in developing and progressing cancer, including glioblastoma4. CircRNA is an endogenous, highly stable, single-stranded closed circular RNA molecule without either a 5′ cap or 3′ polyadenylate tail. CircRNAs are divided into four major types: exonic circRNAs (ecRNAs), circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs), exon–intron circRNAs (EIciRNAs), and intergenic circRNAs, according to the sequence origin4,5.

CircRNAs mainly act as miRNA sponges to modulate downstream mRNA through the constructed a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA (ceRNA) network5. Among the cancer-related circRNAs, circZNF609 and circNfIX functioned as onco-circRNAs, the upregulation of which facilitated cancer cell proliferation and migration by regulating miRNAs.6,7. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a subset of non-coding RNAs conserved across species, regulate gene expression by binding to the 3′-untranslated region of target mRNAs8. In recent years, many studies focused on the regulatory role of miRNAs as the core of the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis that explains the relationship between different classes of RNAs including circRNA, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), miRNAs and mRNAs9. Hsa-miR-145-5p, one of the targets of several dysregulated circRNAs identified in studies, has been widely confirmed to be associated with cancer8,10. Evidence has shown that miR-145-5p can be regulated by different mechanisms and can involve in tumorigenesis and progression through binding to 3′-UTRs of target mRNAs10,11. Several studies have reported that miR-145-5p can significantly suppress tumor progression, including in colorectal cancer (CRC)12, lung cancer13, and glioma14 via targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. EGFR is a trans-membrane receptor tyrosine kinase of the ERBB family and has a role in cell proliferation, differentiation and cell survival. An overexpression of either EGFR or EGFR-activating mutations is associated with poor clinical prognosis in various human tumors15,16. Despite many reports on the molecular mechanism of EGFR, circRNA-induced EGFR regulation in glioblastoma is still poorly understood.

In the current study, using literature review and bioinformatics analysis from different web tools and databases including NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), Circular RNA Interactome database (https://circinteractome.irp.nia.nih.gov/), miRNet (http://www.mirnet.ca) and IntaRNA web servers (https://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IntaRNA/Input.jsp), and miRTarBase (http://miRTarBase.cuhk.edu.cn/), we predicted the presence of a regulatory axis, namely, circZNF609, circNFIX/miR-145-5p/EGFR axis. CircZNF609 was the alias of hsa_circ_0000615 which derived from the host gene ZNF609. Dysregulation of CircZNF609 has been reported in a few cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma17, nasopharyngeal carcinoma18, and hepatocellular carcinoma19. Another circRNA, hsa_circ_0049658, originated from host gene nuclear factor IX (NFIX) mRNA. Previous studies have shown that circNFIX is upregulated in liver cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and glioma, and functions as an oncogene involved in cancer metabolism, chemotherapy resistance, migration and invasion20. However, the influence and mechanism of these circRNAs in glioblastoma needs further research, and whether circZNF609 and circNFIX may play a role as ceRNAs in GBM pathogenesis remains to be investigated. So, we hypothesized that circZNF609 (circ0000615) and circNFIX (circ0049658) regulate EGFR expression through sponging miR-145-5p. The relative expressions of circZNF609, circNFIX, miR-145-5p and EGFR were then evaluated in glioblastoma compared to normal brain tissues. Also, the relationship between the expression of these genes and the clinical features of patients such as age, gender and tumor diameter was assessed.

Materials and methods

Specimens collection and ethics

A total of 51 samples, including 30 tumor tissues from glioblastoma patients and 21 normal brain tissues were collected from the Department of Neurosurgery of Sina Hospital and Shafa Neuroscience Research Center at Khatam Al-Anbia Hospital. All tissue samples were diagnosed by two independent pathologists. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Ethical code: IR.TUMS.MEDICINE.REC.1401.487), and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. None of the patients underwent radiotherapy or chemotherapy before surgery. The clinicopathological features including age, gender, and tumor size of patients were attained from their medical records. Control brain samples were taken from patients with a kind of cerebral hemorrhage that have needed surgery and cerebral lobectomy at the same time. The characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Clinicopathological features of cases.

Bioinformatics analysis and primer design

We screened differential miRNAs in glioblastoma and normal tissues from the GEO dataset (GSE165937, NCBI) using the edgeR package in R software with |logFC|≥ 1, adjust P value < 0.05. Volcano diagram of differentially expressed miRNAs was plotted using ggplot2.

To investigate the relationships between miR-145-5p and its target genes, we used MiRNet (http://www.mirnet.ca), a user-friendly and powerful tool that supports different types of miRNA targets for network creation and analysis.

The interaction between cZNF609 (circ0000615) and cNFIX (circ0049658) with miR-145-5p was performed with online software including Circular RNA Interactome database (CRI, https://circinteractome.irp.nia.nih.gov/) and IntaRNA (https://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IntaRNA/Input.jsp)21. In addition, miRanda (https://regendbase.org/tools/miranda) and miRTarBase (http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/) were used to predict the downstream target of miR-145-5p. According to the complementary regions between the circ0000615, circ0049658, miR-145-5p and EGFR, we hypothesized that these circRNAs regulates EGFR by sponging miR-145-5p and thus, we considered the cZNF609, cNFIX/miRNA-145-5p/EGFR axis for further experiments.

The suitable primers were designed with Primer Blast and Gene Runner software. Moreover, the specificity of divergent primers for hsa_circ_0000615 and hsa_circ_0049658 was checked by circPrimer 1.2 software. The sequences of primers in this study are shown in Table 2.Table 2 Sequences of primers.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR

Approximately 15 mg of frozen tissue samples using liquid nitrogen, were homogenized. Total RNA was then extracted using Kiazol reagent (Kiazist, Iran) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then quantity and purity of RNAs were measured by Nanodrop 2000C (Thermo Scientific, USA) and electrophoresis on 1.8% (wt/vol) agarose gel. RNA samples were converted into cDNA using the cDNA synthesis kit (Yekta Tajhiz Azma, Iran). Reverse transcription of mRNA and miRNA was performed using random primers and specific stem–loop primers, respectively. The reaction condition was set at 70 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 60 min, and 70 °C for 5 min.

The relative expression levels of all genes were evaluated using RealQ Plus 2 × Master Mix Green without Rox (Ampliqon, Denmark) using the LightCycler 96 (Roche, Germany). Thermal cycling conditions for circZNF609, circNFIX and EGFR include preincubation at 95 °C for 900 s followed by amplification in 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60C for 50 s. The suitable annealing temperature for miR-145-5p was 58 °C. SnRNA U6 as a housekeeping gene for miR-145-5p; and GAPDH as a reference gene for circRNAs and EGFR. PCR products were analyzed by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The back-splice junction sequences of circZNF609 and circNFIX were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. All of the qPCR reactions were performed in duplicate and data were calculated by comparing Ct values.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) software. Normality was checked by the Shapiro–Wilk test. The relative expression of circZNF609, circNFIX, miR-145-5p, and EGFR was evaluated in glioblastoma tumors and normal brain tissues using the unpaired sample t test. The association between the expression of circRNAs, miR-145-5p and EGFR with clinicopathological features of patients was calculated using Mann–Whitney and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for the correlation of expression of genes analyses. Also, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to investigate the diagnostic potential of circRNA biomarker(s) by the GraphPad Prism v.8 software. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Clinicopathological features

The median age of participants was 49 years (range, 12–75 years). The gender ratio of male to female patients was 5:1. The average ages at the time of diagnosis were 51.88 ± 15.87 and 55.8 ± 12.25 years for male and female patients, respectively. Most tumors were found in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, in two cases the tumor was located in the brain stem, which were diagnosed at a young age. No family history of brain cancer or other types of cancer has been found in patients.

MiR-145-5p expression was decreased in glioblastoma tissues

Using bioinformatic analysis of raw data from the GEO dataset, we investigated the expression levels of miRNAs in GBM tissues compared to normal brain tissues (Supplementary Table 1). According to hypothesis of this study, we focused on miR-145 analysis. The results indicated that the expression of miR-145-5p was significantly lower in glioblastoma tissues than in normal tissues (log FC: − 1.25, adj p value = 0.0342) (Fig. 1).Figure 1 Volcano diagram of differentially expressed miRNAs in glioblastoma. |log2FC|> 1 and adj p-value < 0.05 were considered as cut-off values for the identification of DE-miRNAs. Blue and red dots denote the downregulated and upregulated miRNAs in glioblastoma samples; grey dots denote miRNAs without differential expression between GBM and normal samples. The arrow represents the miR-145-5p.

miRNA–target interactions

The interaction between hsa-miR-145-5p and its target genes, which was performed using miRNet, represented as a network. The resulting miRNA-target interactions showed that 1602 circRNAs and 238 genes interact with hsa-miR-145-5p. The genes investigated in this study were indicated as bigger nodes (Fig. 2). We hypothesized that circZNF609 and circNFIX regulates EGFR through sponging miR-145-5p. The interaction sites between circZNF609 (circ0000615) and circNFIX (circ0049658) with miR-145-5p and also binding sites between miR-145-5p and EGFR are illustrated in Fig. 3A–C), respectively.Figure 2 Predicted target genes of miR-145-5p. miRNet was used for establishing a network of miR-145-5p and their target genes. Blue rectangle represents has-mir-145-5p; purple and orange dots represent target genes and circRNAs; the dots shown with two colors represent circRNA-gene.

Evaluating the expression differences of cZNF609, cNFIX, miR‑145 and EGFR between glioblastomas and normal tissues

CircZNF609 (hsa_circ_0000615) is derived from the circulation of the second exon of ZNF609. This back splice junction site was verified by the Sanger sequencing (Fig. 4A). CircNFIX (hsa_circ_0049658) is reverse spliced from the mRNA exons 3-8 of the host gene nuclear factor IX (NFIX) (Fig. 4B). Expression analysis showed a significant upregulation of circZNF609 in GBM samples compared to normal brain tissue (p = 0.001) (Fig. 5A), whereas circNFIX gene expression was increased in tumor samples compared to normal samples, but not significantly (p = 0.06) (Fig. 5B). We also found downregulation of miR-145-5p (p = 0.0065) (Fig. 5C) and upregulation of EGFR (p = 0.002) in GBM samples compared to normal tissue (Fig. 5D).Figure 4 Schematic representation of (A) circ0000615 and (B) circ0049658 biogenesis. The back splice junction site of these circRNAs was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Correlation analysis between expression levels of cZNF609, cNFIX, miR-145-5p, and EGFR

Pearson’s correlation analysis showed the correlation between the expression levels of cZNF609, cNFIX, miR-145-5p, and EGFR. Results demonstrated a negative significant correlation of circZNF609 and circNFIX with miR-145-5p (r = − 0.481, p = 0.0003; and r = − 0.465, p = 0.0006) (Fig. 6A, B), and a strong inverse correlation was observed between the expression of miR-145-5p and EGFR (r = -0.359, p = 0.009) (Fig. 6C). Notably, a significant positive correlation was observed between circZNF609 and circNFIX with EGFR mRNA levels in GBM patients (r = 0.4536, p = 0.0008; r = 0.329, p = 0.018) (Fig. 6D, E).Figure 6 The correlation between expression levels of (A) circZNF609 and miR-145-5p, (B) circNFIX and miR-145-5p (C) miR-145-5p and EGFR, (D) circZNF609 and EGFR, and (E) circNFIX and EGFR genes in GBM tissues compared with normal brain samples.

The identified correlation pattern between circZNF609, circNFIX, miR-145-5p and EGFR is consistent with our hypothesis regarding the sponging effect of cZNF609 (circ0000615) and cNFIX (circ0049658) on miR-145-5p. The expression correlation between cZNF609, cNFIX, miR-145-5p and EGFR in both tumor and normal tissues is represented by a grouped graph (Fig. 7).Figure 7 Grouped graph of expression correlation of cZNF609, cNFIX, miR-145-5p and EGFR in GBM and normal tissues as calculated by Pearson correlation.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis

The possible clinical utility of cNFIX and cZNF609 as a distinct GBM biomarker was evaluated by ROC curve analysis (Fig. 8A, B). The ROC curve analysis for cZNF609 indicates that this biomarker was well able to discriminate between tumoral and non-tumoral tissues due to its high level of AUC, sensitivity, and specificity (p = 0.001) (Fig. 8B).Figure 8 ROC curve analysis of (A) circNFIX and (B) circZNF609 expression for discrimination of GBM tumors from normal tissues.

Association between expression of circZNF609, circNFIX, miR-145-5p and EGFR and clinicopathological parameters

We assessed the association of circZNF609, circNFIX, miR-145-5p and EGFR expression levels in tumoral vs normal brain tissues with clinicopathological parameters. There was no significant difference in age, gender and tumor size among the groups (p > 0.05).

Discussion

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive diffuse glioma of astrocytic lineage and is considered a grade IV glioma based on 2021 WHO classification of CNS tumors22. The current standard treatment for glioblastoma involves surgery, chemotherapy and, radiotherapy23. However, as the average overall survival of patients is low, new diagnostic and treatment approaches are needed. Due to the rapid progression, even with aggressive multimodal therapy, glioblastoma remains almost incurable24. It is known that one of the most important cell signaling pathways involved in the development of glioblastoma is epidermal growth factor receptor. The EGFR signaling cascade activates several intracellular signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways, and thus can cause proliferation and tumor growth, angiogenesis, and alteration of the tumor microenvironment25. Existing evidence has demonstrated that EGFR overexpressed in ~ 60% of primary GBM patients. Therefore, a better understanding of the EGFR signaling network and its interactions with other pathways is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance and to develop better therapeutic agents24,25. Today, cancer treatment has moved towards pathway-based biomarkers therapies26. The research has provided new insight to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in glioblastoma3. Many studies revealed that noncoding RNAs such as circRNAs, lncRNAs and microRNAs could regulate many important pathological processes including initiation, progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. Several lines of evidence indicate the role of circular RNA molecules in different types of cancers, including glioma27. However, the molecular mechanism of circRNAs remains largely unknown.

circRNAs are endogenous single-stranded RNAs with covalently closed-loop structures and are highly stable, conserved, and abundantly expressed in various tissues28. Circ-ZNF609 (circBase ID: hsa_circ_0000615), with a full length of 874 bp, located at chr15: 64791491–64792365, is derived from the circulation of the second exon of ZNF60929. Circ-NFIX (hsa_circ_0049658) located in chr 19 (13183860-13192669), backspliced by exons 3-8 and 695 bp in length30. These circRNAs have highly conserved and fundamental biological functions among different species, suggesting that they play a critical role in cellular processes or organismal development31,32. Circ-ZNF609 and circ-NFIX have been identified as circular RNAs expressed in neural tissue and may therefore play an important role in neural functions or processes28. Recently, several studies have reported dysregulation of cZNF609 and cNFIX in various tumors and diseases7,18,30,33,34. In breast cancer, circZNF609 plays an oncogenic role by elevating p70S6K1 expression via sponging miR-145-5p35. According to the study by Pan et al., circNFIX attenuated pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by regulating miR-145-5p/ATF3 axis36. Thus, MiR-145-5p might be sponged by cZNF609 and cNFIX, and its expression was regulated by these circRNAs. Previous studies have shown that the expression of miR-145-5p is decreased in GBM patients, suggesting it can be a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for this condition37. Another study reported that circZNF609 promotes glioma cell migration and proliferation via the miR-134-5p/BTG-2 axis38. In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), elevated level of circZNF609 has been associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, the functional investigation indicated that circZNF609 regulated LSCC cell proliferation and invasion by sponging miR-342-3p and upregulating EGFR8. Xiao et al.20 demonstrated that circNFIX regulates the HCC progression and glutaminolysis by targeting miR-3064-5p/HMGA2 axis. Xu et al., discovered through bioinformatics and experimental analysis that circNFIX promotes glioma progression by regulating miR-34a-5p via Notch signaling pathway. Several miRNAs, including miR-145-5p, were also reported to have binding sites with circNFIX in this study7. Therefore, aberrant expression of these circRNAs plays an important role in tumor proliferation, cell cycle regulation, invasion, and metastasis by modulating complementary miRNAs or target mRNAs linked to cancer-related signaling pathways39–41. These findings suggest that circZNF609 and circNFIX may act as predictive biomarkers for cancer prognosis and as promising targets for cancer therapy. However, the specific role of circ-ZNF609 in glioblastoma remains largely unexplored.

In this study, we first predicted the circZNF609, circNFIX/miR-145-5p/EGFR axis by extracting data from the literature and bioinformatics analysis using databases and web tools. Then, we evaluated the expression of each gene of this axis in 30 glioblastoma tissues and 21 normal brain tissues.

The results demonstrated that circZNF609 expression was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues (p = 0.001). CircNFIX gene expression was not significant in tumor versus normal samples (p = 0.06). In comparison, a study by Ding et al., performed on 65 glioma samples and 15 normal samples, showed that the expression level of circNFIX was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared to the normal control group, and there was a significant difference between the low and high grade groups. Furthermore, knockdown of circNFIX suppressed glioma progression in vitro and in vivo, possibly by regulating the miR-378e/RPN2 axis as a ceRNA42. This finding supports the previous studies indicating an oncogenic mechanism for cZNF609 and cNFIX in different types of tumors6,18,20,30. Also, miR-145-5p and EGFR expression levels in glioblastoma tumors compared with normal brain tissues were decreased and increased, respectively (p = 0.0065, p = 0.002), while there was no statistically significant difference between expression levels of circZNF609, circNFIX, miR-145-5p, and EGFR genes with clinicopathological characteristics of patients, including age, gender and tumor size (p > 0.05). To use the relation of expression of these genes in clinic, further studies with more samples of different types of glioma are necessary. According to the ROC curve analysis, we found that circZNF609 transcript levels had more than 70% specificity in this regard, indicating that this circRNA can serve as good predictive biomarker to distinguish malignant from non-malignant tissues. Therefore, in samples suspicious for this disease, assessing the expression level of cZNF609 can be useful in evaluating the malignancy of the tissue. In contrast, the AUC of cNFIX was 0.636 with 53.3% sensitivity and 61.9% specificity in GBM patients (p = 0.1038) (Fig. 8A). Thus, it is not a good biomarker to discriminate tumor from normal tissues.

Our findings showed that the expression of cZNF609 and cNFIX was significantly negatively correlated with the expression of miR-145-5p (r = − 0.481, p = 0.0003 and r = − 0.465, p = 0.0006, respectively). Additionally, cZNF609 and cNFIX was highly positively correlated with EGFR expression (r = 0.453, p = 0.0008; r = 0.329, p = 0.018).

We also found an inverse correlation between EGFR and miR-145-5p expression levels (r = − 0.359 and p = 0.009). By analyzing miR-145 expression levels in GBM patients in this present study, 16 out of 30 patients showed ≥ two-fold reduction of miR-145 expression, which was associated with upregulation of the EGFR expression.

Based on bioinformatics analysis, EGFR was identified as a putative target of miR-145-5p (Fig. 2). Three binding sites for this microRNA were predicted in the EGFR gene using miRTarBase (Fig. 3C). In addition, there is strong evidence of interaction between the EGFR and miR-145 in glioma. Lu et al. showed that restoration of miR-145 in glioma cells significantly reduced in vitro proliferation, migration and invasion. Overexpression of miR-145 also reduced the expression of ADAM17 and EGFR14. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that miR-145 may modulate EGFR expression. However, we speculate that there may be other target genes that competitively interact with miR-145. These need further investigation.

The present study is limited by the relatively small number of patients. Further studies with a larger group of patients and an approximately equal number of male and female participants are needed to determine reliable prognostic value.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that circZNF609 and circNFIX may play a role in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma through the miR-145/EGFR axis, which requires functional studies. Further in vitro and in vivo model studies are needed to better understand the mechanism of this axis. Identifying molecular dysregulations in the EGFR signaling pathway may pave the way for potential therapeutic interventions and improve medical diagnosis.
