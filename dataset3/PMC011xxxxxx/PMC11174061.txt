==== Body
pmcIt has been brought to the attention of the Editorial Office that Figure 1 in the original publication [1] contained a duplicated picture that was mistakenly included in the paper. The authors acknowledge that this error occurred due to the similarity in the file names, which went unnoticed during the preparation of the figures. The corrected Figure 1 appears below. The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated.

Figure 1 Transmission electron microscopy image of spent FeNP@SBA-15 (after 10 runs).
