Chromic materials, capable of dynamic colour changes, represent a captivating realm where hues respond to external stimuli. These materials span diverse categories, including photochromic, thermochromic, and electrochromic variants, demonstrating versatile optical properties and adaptability to colour shifts under different triggers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Table 1 shows that recent strides in thermochromic polymer nanocomposites have notably fortified their stability and versatility, auguring significant implications across multiple industries [10,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. The evolution of thermochromic materials, depicted in Figure 1, began in the 1970s, primarily focusing on colour transitions linked to temperature [24,25]. Gradually, research progressed from mere novelties to nanostructured variants, enabling precise colour modulation for sensors, displays, and eco-friendly coatings. These materials now hold potential for energy-efficient building coatings and drug delivery systems, highlighting their role in sustainability and energy conservation [26,27,28]. Their growing relevance aligns with global energy conservation initiatives. For example, “cool roofs,” aiming to minimise solar energy absorption and surface temperatures, showcase the materials’ role in enhancing energy efficiency, especially in warmer regions. Given the substantial energy consumption by the building and automotive industries, these materials significantly impact urban environments, influencing energy use and indoor air quality [29,30,31,32,33,34].

Understanding and employing reversible thermochromic materials requires a comprehensive assessment across structural, optical, thermal, and mechanical aspects. Techniques like UV–Vis spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy help analyse critical parameters, offering insights into their responsiveness [35,36,37,38,39,40,41]. Recent advancements show promise by enabling colour changes with temperature shifts across various sectors. Improved manufacturing methods aim to enhance the efficiency of temperature-responsive windows while reducing energy consumption and promoting eco-friendly waste management [42,43,44,45]. These methods involve molecular changes, phase transitions, and alterations in nanoparticles or molecular structures induced by temperature variations. Some materials use specific dyes or pigments to achieve colour changes, with various techniques like in situ polymerization and nanoparticle encapsulation developed for specific applications such as temperature sensors and smart coatings [19,34,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53].

Addressing challenges like durability in reversible thermochromic coatings demands robust solutions. Implementing stringent manufacturing processes and protective layers has been pivotal [3,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63]. Recent research explores theoretical frameworks, nanocomposite polymer films, photonic fibres, and smart polymers to bolster functionalities and expand usage [10,46,64,65,66]. Reversible thermochromic materials’ adaptability makes them powerful tools across industries, especially in sensor-based heat detection devices.

In construction, integrating these materials into thermal imaging systems aids in the real-time identification of heat loss or inadequate insulation. This not only flags energy inefficiencies but also prompts swift rectification measures, enhancing energy conservation. Within the automotive sector, applying reversible thermochromic coatings to engine components or electrical systems creates temperature sensors, critical for monitoring thermal conditions. These sensors prevent overheating risks, ensuring better safety and durability and averting potential breakdowns or accidents.

2. Reversible Thermochromic

2.1. Fundamental of the Reversible Thermochromism

Reversible thermochromism is a fascinating property seen in certain materials that change colour as temperatures vary. Comprehending this phenomenon is crucial for tailoring materials with temperature-dependent colour shifts. When exposed to different temperatures, reversible thermochromic materials change colour reversibly, returning to their original hue when the temperature normalizes. This effect occurs due to molecular rearrangements, energy level transitions, or changes in particle size affecting light absorption, reflection, or scattering, leading to observable colour changes. Mechanisms behind reversible thermochromism, like conformational shifts or reversible chemical reactions, vary per material. Incorporating specific additives or nanoparticles with temperature-dependent optical traits enables controlled colour shifts (see Figure 2). This foundational understanding is vital for crafting materials with customised thermochromic properties, expanding their application in diverse fields [15,22,23]. Otherwise, Figure 2 depicts the thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) data that can guide spectroscopic analysis by pinpointing relevant temperature ranges for detailed spectroscopic measurements. This targeted approach enhances the efficiency and informativeness of data collection during spectroscopic studies.

Recent research conducted by Zhang et al. [70] sheds light on polydiacetylene-based thermochromic materials and their functioning. Their study highlighted that temperature-induced structural changes affected the material’s core structure, altering electron distribution and, consequently, the absorption spectrum. This caused a transition in colour, shifting from red to blue as temperatures increased. Additionally, transitions between solid, liquid, or gaseous states affected how these materials interacted with light, further influencing colour changes. Reversible thermochromic materials can also change colour through reversible chemical reactions and by adding thermochromic components. The degree of colour change within specific temperature ranges depends on temperature sensitivity, while chemical components like chromophores and additives impact light absorption and reflection.

Environmental elements like humidity, pressure, and light exposure significantly affect observed colour shifts. Liu et al. [71] research highlighted how varying humidity levels impacted colour transition temperatures in smart thermochromic coatings. Moreover, controlling heating and cooling rates allows for manipulating colour changes. Recent advancements by Wang et al. [72] showed how adjusting temperature change rates affected phase transition kinetics, enabling customised colour-switching speeds in thermochromic materials, and paving the way for adaptable applications in smart sensors and displays.

2.2. Thermochromic Mechanism and Classification

Reversible thermochromic materials display intriguing colour changes affected by temperature, composition, and environmental factors [73]. These alterations occur due to changes in their molecular structure when temperatures shift, affecting how they appear visually. Table 2 summarises recent studies on these materials, categorising them based on different triggers, which find applications in devices like heat chambers, electrical components, and transformers [74,75,76]. Understanding the mechanisms behind thermochromism is crucial to grasping how these materials change colour. Various mechanisms are involved, influenced by specific factors, contributing to colour shifts and reversibility. This section aims to explore these fundamental mechanisms, depicted in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6, through diverse experimental techniques. Table 3 further summarises these mechanisms, allowing tailored materials for applications ranging from smart coatings to industrial monitoring and making them versatile across industries.

a. Crystal transition mechanism

The fascinating phenomenon of thermochromism, especially notable in metal ion compounds, involves crystal transitions triggering colour changes with temperature variations. Understanding the dynamic correlation between structural phase transitions and discolouration in thermochromic materials (Figure 3a), particularly during crystalline versus glass synthesis transformations, elucidates complex intermolecular pathways (Figure 3b). During crystalline synthesis, thermochromic compounds exhibit highly organised molecular structures. At lower temperatures, these structures remain stable, displaying a distinct colour attributed to crystal lattice electrical transitions or absorption processes. However, increased temperature leads to lattice vibrations that disrupt the crystal structure, affecting electron energy levels and altering the absorption spectrum and colour. This dynamic interaction between molecular configurations and thermal energy underlies thermochromism in crystalline materials.

In contrast, glass synthesis results in amorphous or disordered thermochromic materials lacking a long-range structured crystal lattice. Molecular mobility rises with temperature, influencing interactions between neighbouring molecules and, thus, changing the material’s electrical and optical characteristics, leading to colour changes. Various intermolecular mechanisms contribute to the dynamic relationship between structural phase transitions and discolouration in thermochromic materials. Crystalline synthesis-induced lattice disruptions alter the electrical environment, modifying the absorption spectrum and colour with temperature. Conversely, in glass synthesis, changes in molecular mobility and local environments influence optical characteristics, causing colour shifts without structural alterations.

For instance, compounds like Cu2HgI4 and Ag2HgI4 change colour as their structure shifts from tetrahedral to cubic when heated. Understanding this crystal transition is vital for real-world applications like architecture, where reversible thermochromic materials in building coatings identify thermal inefficiencies, aiding in energy conservation and cost-effective heating [87,88]. In automotive paint, thermochromic coatings signal potential overheating in engines or electrical systems, preventing failures and ensuring safety [84,89]. Moreover, in healthcare, thermochromic materials are explored for body temperature sensors, providing non-invasive monitoring and aiding in prompt medical interventions, especially for fever or hypothermia [85,90]. These applications highlight the adaptability and versatility of these materials across industries, showcasing their potential for diverse needs, from energy efficiency to health monitoring.

(a) Phase diagram of imidazole-based ionic liquids (Im-ILs) showing the gradual loss of 3D crystalline order with increasing temperature. (b) Tin’s electron configuration change alters the crystal lattice due to a temperature change.

b. Ligand geometry mechanism

Thermochromism, observed in inorganic materials like those containing Cr3+ ions, occurs when the molecular arrangement changes with temperature [91,92]. For instance, materials with Cr3+ ions shift colours by adjusting their structure when heated, whereas the ions around the central ion are altered due to an expansion in the crystal lattice’s octahedral structure. This change in ion arrangement inside the crystal influences the material’s colour (Figure 4a) [93,96]. In real-world applications, inorganic thermochromic materials play a role in smart packaging for perishable goods, as seen in Figure 4b, with milk carton packaging changing colour near its expiration date. These smart packages, integrated with thermochromic materials, react to temperature changes caused by spoilage. This colour shift signals changes in product freshness or environmental temperature. The mechanisms behind these materials influence the packaging’s colour, serving as a warning to consumers or handlers about potential temperature-related issues during storage or transport.

c. Coordination number mechanism

The concept of coordination number, essential in complex compounds, plays a crucial role in thermochromism, especially in inorganic salts like nickel and cobalt salts, often containing crystal water [46]. Take iron phosphate (FePO4•2H2O) as an example. It exhibits two structural forms—orthogonal and monoclinic—each linked to distinct coordination numbers. The presence or loss of crystal water profoundly affects its colour. With crystal water, it is a light yellowish–white powder; without, it turns yellow–white [76]. Materials sensitive to humidity changes, altering colour based on moisture levels, can power humidity-sensing devices. Similarly, smart packaging employing these materials could signal temperature or humidity changes in food storage, ensuring food quality [97].

(b) The local structural models employing FePO4•2H2O by different coordination number and crystal water content [99], (c) Humidity sensing device [100].

d. Liquid crystal mechanism

Reversible liquid crystal thermochromic materials, particularly the cholesteric type, exhibit a unique mechanism that guides their colour changes. Figure 6 depicts their structure as a spiral arrangement with a variable pitch, defining how tightly the spiral turns. As temperature shifts, this spiral’s pitch alters, changing the light wavelength the material reflects and absorbs. This shift in light wavelength affects its intensity, resulting in colour changes [95]. Researchers can customise these materials by tweaking the spiral pitch response to temperature changes and tailoring colour behaviour to specific needs. Additionally, these materials serve as temperature-sensitive indicators in industries, helping to prevent overheating or machinery failures.

2.3. Synthesis Techniques for Reversible Thermochromic

Creating reversible thermochromic materials involves methods crucial for their wide application in various fields. These methods aim to make these materials more adaptable, responsive, and energy-efficient across different uses. Techniques like in situ polymerization, solution mixing, melt blending, nanoparticle encapsulation, and coating/impregnation are pivotal for tailoring thermochromic properties [74,75,103,104]. Notable advancements in various deposition techniques include the chemical deposition method and nanocomposite coatings and impregnation method to synthesize and manufacture thermochromic composite and facilitate nanocomposite solar energy transmission based on temperature changes, as developed by Zhang et al. [105], and polymer nanocomposites created by Abdellaoui et al. [46], enabling responsive sensors and versatile materials. In addition, the research by Vaghasiya et al. [106] delved into the integration of various technique (i.e., coating/impregnation and in situ polymerization) to produce wearable thermochromic sensors integrated into flexible patches for health monitoring.

However, challenges persist, such as ensuring consistent exposure and durability; therefore, future studies aim to address these hurdles by enhancing response times, achieving better exposure on complex surfaces, improving durability, and expanding application in various environments. Thus, a combination synthesis technique is used to explore new materials and integrate thermochromic materials into wearable devices that shows promise for future research, as highlighted by Hakami et al. [107]. In addition, Table 4 summarises the schematic of various synthesis techniques used for tailored thermochromic properties, reflecting their potential applications and future research directions.

Similarly, microscopic techniques such as SEM and TEM benefit from temperature control to observe morphological changes and colour variations in high-resolution images [77]. By imaging samples at controlled temperatures, researchers can analyse how temperature influences particle distribution and surface features, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of thermochromic materials’ behaviour [127]. Overall, temperature control enables researchers to unravel the dynamic interplay between temperature, molecular structure, and optical properties in thermochromic materials, crucial for their development and optimization for various applications.

Thermal analysis methods like DSC and TGA measure heat flow, phase transitions, enthalpy changes, and thermal stability, offering crucial insights into material compatibility at various temperatures. dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) evaluates viscoelastic behaviour, glass transition temperatures, and mechanical stability under different conditions, aiding in understanding material responses in diverse scenarios. Mechanical testing, especially tensile testing, assesses material strength, flexibility, and overall performance, which are essential for evaluating their robustness and mechanical behaviour. Surface analysis through techniques like AFM and XPS investigates surface morphology, roughness, and chemical composition, vital for assessing long-term stability and colour-changing capabilities.

These characterization methods are indispensable for understanding the mechanical, thermal, optical, structural, and surface characteristics of reversible thermochromic materials. They significantly contribute to their analysis and potential applications, ranging from enhancing energy efficiency to tailoring materials for diverse sectors. Future research aims to refine these methods to delve deeper into the intricate behaviour of these materials, optimising their functionality across applications and enhancing adaptability, durability, and responsiveness.

2.5. Advance Properties of Reversible Thermochromic Materials

The realm of smart materials introduces an exciting paradigm of adaptability within varying environmental conditions [166]. Among these, thermochromic nanocomposites stand out due to their captivating optical and thermal attributes, making them a focal point of scientific inquiry. This section delves into the diverse techniques employed for assessing these materials (Table 7), showcasing their properties through specific characterization methods.

The study by Sun et al. [171] involved the production of microcapsules from cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) using the complex coacervation technique. This intricate process, encompassing emulsification, coacervation, and crosslinking, demonstrated remarkable success. The SEM and TEM analyses confirmed the effective encapsulation of CLC, showcasing a particle diameter of about 3–5 µm with uniformed porous structure (Figure 7). Meanwhile, the investigation by Agra-Kooijman et al. [172] utilised polyester filaments pre-coated with thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC) ink to create breathable thermochromic textiles, enhancing their versatility [173]. The combination of pre-coated yarns was selected to achieve the desired thermochromic properties. The resulting knitted and handwoven fabric samples exhibited excellent reversible colour changes from red to blue as the temperature increased from 26 to 32 °C (Figure 8), demonstrating their potential for adaptive applications, consistent with the properties of the TLC ink used.

Furthermore, the innovative approach by Yunxiang Chen et al. [175] involved a novel thermochromic nanocomposite comprising the ionic liquid Nickel–Bromine–Ionic Liquid (Ni-Br-IL) alongside vanadium oxide (VO2) nanoparticles. Advanced analyses revealed significant enhancements in thermochromic characteristics, promising applications in smart windows [176]. Therefore, all above discussion studies elucidate the evolving landscape of thermochromic materials; the showcased results not only affirm successful encapsulation and improved thermochromic properties but also hint at prospective applications in diverse fields, especially in smart windows and adaptable materials. The ongoing exploration in this domain paves the way for further research avenues, delving deeper into material synthesis, characterization, and application development for a myriad of industries.

3. Application in Heat Detection Systems

The exploration and enhancement of heat-sensing systems utilizing reversible thermochromic materials is a critical frontier in bolstering their operational efficacy [102,177,178,179]. This research phase delves into the nuanced responses of these materials to temperature fluctuations, a cornerstone for advancing efficient heat detection systems. Notably, vanadium oxide, a prevalent component in smart windows, has showcased a noteworthy 9.4% reduction in energy consumption compared to traditional methods, as exemplified by Ye et al. [180].

3.2. Coating and Smart Window Systems Applications

Thermochromic materials show potential for energy-efficient smart windows and thermoregulation applications, pivotal for reducing carbon emissions in buildings. Table 9 outlines the various mechanical properties of commonly used thermochromic materials in smart window applications. Liquid crystal polymers, characterised by their liquid crystal structures, exhibit a reorientation temperature range (−20 °C to 50 °C) in thermochromic windows. In the sector of smart windows, a comparison between various thermochromic materials is pivotal, especially concerning their energy-saving potential. Among these materials, vanadium dioxide (VO2) coatings have garnered attention due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability for large-scale applications [193]. For instance, Louloudakis et al. [176,194] has demonstrated that VO2 coatings exhibit a notable thermochromic transition at low temperature, shifting from a transparent to a reflective state upon heating. It is shown that the precursor flow rate is not the critical factor to influence the thermochromic characteristics of the coatings. Hence, this transition effectively regulates solar heat gain, thereby reducing the need for artificial cooling in buildings [195].

In this case, Arnaoutakis and Katsaprakakis [196] have underscored the significant energy-saving benefits of incorporating VO2 coatings into windows. For instance, investigations into energy consumption for heating and cooling in buildings equipped with VO2-coated smart windows have revealed substantial reductions compared to conventional windows. The dynamic response of VO2 coatings to environmental conditions allows for efficient energy usage, contributing to improved building sustainability and occupant comfort. Ongoing advancements in fabrication techniques and material engineering further enhance the appeal of VO2 coatings for widespread adoption in energy-efficient building designs. These findings underscore the potential of VO2 coatings as state-of-the-art thermochromic materials for smart windows, offering compelling energy-saving solutions for architectural applications.

In summary, this reorientation alters their optical properties, influencing the window’s behaviour and the change in phase or properties of the microcapsule contents due to temperature directly influences the materials’ light transmission properties, affecting their optical characteristics. Furthermore, Figure 10 displays user-controlled smart windows with transparent heaters (smart-shield hydrogel), ensuring privacy and reducing heating and energy saving. These advancements underline the need for thermochromic materials with enhanced mechanical properties, durability, flexibility, and longevity, aligning them with eco-friendly architectural solutions.

This comprehensive review thoroughly examined the complexities associated with integrating these polymers into nanocomposite systems, assessing both their advantages and challenges. Among the synthetises processes of reversible thermochromic, solution-based synthesis and in situ polymerization are two most common techniques. Solution-based synthesis methods offer advantages such as scalability and control over material properties. By adjusting parameters such as solvent composition and polymer concentration, researchers can tailor the properties of reversible thermochromic polymer nanocomposites to suit specific applications. Additionally, solution-based synthesis allows for the incorporation of functional additives to enhance the performance of the nanocomposites. In situ polymerization techniques enable the direct synthesis of polymer nanocomposites within the desired matrix, facilitating better dispersion of nanoparticles and improved interfacial adhesion. This approach offers advantages in terms of process efficiency and control over material properties. The intrinsic ability of these materials to change colour in response to temperature fluctuations renders them highly promising for heat detection technologies. For instance, in building insulation, while these polymers can aid in identifying areas of heat loss or inadequate insulation, their restricted colour range may impede precise temperature detection. Moreover, their dependency on external stimuli like electricity or UV light can complicate implementation and escalate expenses. Addressing these challenges is paramount to fully unlocking the potential of reversible thermochromic polymer nanocomposites in heat detection systems. Continuous research efforts aimed at expanding colour options and reducing reliance on external triggers present promising avenues for enhancing their efficacy. Reversible thermochromic materials are highly advantages for applications such as building insulation. In this instance, reversible thermochromic polymer nanocomposites offer significant potential for improving building insulation by enabling the detection of areas with heat loss or inadequate insulation. However, the limited colour range of these polymers poses a challenge to precise temperature detection. Future research should focus on developing polymers with a broader colour palette to enhance their applicability in building insulation systems. Additionally, in industrial processes, reversible thermochromic polymer nanocomposites can play a crucial role in monitoring temperature changes and optimizing energy usage. However, their reliance on external triggers such as electricity or UV light may hinder their integration into industrial settings.
