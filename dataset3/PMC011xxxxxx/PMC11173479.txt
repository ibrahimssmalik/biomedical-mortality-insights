pmc1. Introduction

Anthriscus sylvestris L. Hoffm. (Umbelliferae), known as wild chervil, is a common perennial plant in Europe, North America, and Asia [1,2]. Its dried root has been used as an anti-pyretic, analgesic, diuretic, and anti-tussive agent in traditional Chinese medicine [3]. The major classes of phytochemicals of A. sylvestris include lignans, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids [4,5]. Pharmacological investigations have demonstrated that this plant possesses certain biological properties such as anti-tumor, anti-proliferative, anti-asthmatic, and anti-inflammatory [6,7,8].

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic, progressive disease of the pulmonary circulation characterized by vascular remodeling [9]. Pulmonary vascular remodeling involves a variety of cells, including vascular endothelial cells, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), and multiple inflammatory cells [10,11]. The previous study demonstrated that diarylpentanoids and phenylpropanoids isolated from the roots of A. sylvestris could inhibit the abnormal proliferation of PASMCs induced by hypoxia [12], which attracted our interest to search for more natural products with anti-proliferative effects from this plant. In this study, two new nitrogen-containing phenylpropanoids (1–2), and two new phenol glycosides (8–9), along with fifteen known analogues, were isolated from the roots of A. sylvestris, and their anti-proliferative effects against the abnormal proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells were evaluated.

2. Results and Discussion

2.1. Structure Characterization

The chemical investigations on the extract of the roots of A. sylvestris resulted in the characterization of compounds (1–19) (Figure 1).

Compound 1, a white amorphous powder, was assigned a molecular formula of C20H17NO4 due to the HRESIMS ion at m/z 336.1230 [M + Na]+ (calcd. 336.1232). The 1D NMR spectrum of 1 exhibited the signals of a carbonyl carbon [δC 180.3 (C-19)], a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring [δH 6.62 (1H, s, H-2), 6.56 (1H, s, H-6); δC 150.8 (C-3), 145.0 (C-5), 136.8 (C-4), 132.3 (C-1), 108.8 (C-6), 100.9 (C-2)], a disubstituted aromatic ring [δH 8.35 (1H, dd, J = 7.8, 1.3 Hz, H-15), 7.80 (2H, overlap, H-14,17), 7.47 (1H, t, J = 7.8 Hz, H-16); δC 141.6 (C-13), 133.9 (C-14), 127.8 (C-18), 127.1 (C-15), 125.4 (C-16), 118.2 (C-17)], two olefinic groups [δH 8.11 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz, H-11), 6.47 (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz, H-8), 6.36 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz, H-12), 6.29 (1H, dt, J = 15.9, 5.8 Hz, H-9); δC 146.4 (C-11), 134.6 (C-8), 122.6 (C-9), 110.2 (C-12)], an oxygenated methylene group [δH 5.88 (2H, s, H-7); δC 102.7 (C-7)], a nitrogenated methylene group [δH 5.07 (2H, d, J = 5.8 Hz, H-10); δC 55.8 (C-10)], and a methoxy group [δH 3.82 (3H, s, OCH3-5); δC 57.2 (OCH3-5)]. The 1D NMR data of compound 1 were very similar to those of 2-[2-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)ethyl]-6-methoxy-1(2H)-isoquinolinone [13]. Major discrepancies were concentrated on the absence of the methoxy group at C-16 and the presence of the methoxy group at C-5, and the Δ8(9) double bond linked with a methylene carbon, which was confirmed by the 1H-1H COSY correlations of H-9 with H-8 and H-10 and the HMBC crosspeaks from H-8 to C-2 and C-6, from H-10 to C-11, and from the hydrogens of the methoxy group (δH 3.82) to C-5 (Figure 2). Based on these data, the structure of compound 1 was identified and named as anthriscusin O.

Compound 2 was obtained as a colorless solid. Its molecular formula, C21H19NO4, was established by the HRESIMS ion at m/z 372.1205 [M + Na]+ (calcd. for 372.1206). The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1) of 2 revealed the presence of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring [δH 6.52 (1H, s, H-2), 6.47 (1H, s, H-6); δC 150.6 (C-3), 144.9 (C-5), 135.9 (C-4), 133.9 (C-1), 108.0 (C-6), 100.5 (C-2)], a quinoline unit [δH 8.82 (1H, d, J = 4.6 Hz, H-14), 8.20 (1H, d, J = 8.4 Hz, H-16), 8.05 (1H, d, J = 8.4 Hz, H-19), 7.78 (1H, t, J = 8.4 Hz, H-17), 7.70 (1H, d, J = 4.6 Hz, H-13), 7.64 (1H, t, J = 8.4 Hz, H-18); δC 153.3 (C-12), 151.0 (C-14), 148.7 (C-20), 130.6 (C-17), 129.9 (C-19), 127.9 (C-18), 127.0 (C-15), 124.7 (C-16), 119.1 (C-13)], an olefinic group [δH 6.27 (1H, d, J = 15.8 Hz, H-8), 6.17 (1H, dt, J = 15.8, 5.8 Hz, H-9); δC 133.6 (C-8), 125.6 (C-9)], an oxygenated methine group [δH 5.60 (1H, dd, J = 7.2, 5.8 Hz, H-11); δC 70.4 (C-11)], an oxygenated methylene group [δH 5.87 (2H, s, H-7); δC 102.5 (C-7)], a methylene group [δH 2.76 (1H, m, H-10a), 2.68 (1H, dd, J = 14.3, 7.2 Hz, H-10b); δC 43.0 (C-10)], and a methoxy group [δH 3.82 (3H, s, OCH3-5); δC 57.2 (OCH3-5)]. The 1H and 13C NMR data of 2 were similar to those of (2E)-3-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-propen-1-yl]benzenemethanol [14], except for the absence of the aromatic group and the presence of a quinoline unit at C-11 and an additional methoxy group at C-5, which was deduced by the HMBC correlations from H-11 to C-13 and C-15, and from the hydrogens of the methoxy group (δH 3.82) to C-5 (Figure 2). To define the absolute configuration, the ECD calculation was performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d) level using the TDDFT method. Furthermore, the agreement of the Cotton effects of the calculated ECD spectrum of (R)-2 with the experimental ECD spectrum of 2 allowed the absolute configuration of 2 to be assigned as (R) (Figure 3). Thus, the structure of 2 was elucidated as shown and named as anthriscusin P.

Compound 8 was acquired as a white amorphous powder with a molecular formula of C17H24O9, as determined by its HRESIMS and 13C NMR data. The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 2) of 8 were similar to those of 12 [15], except for the replacement of the methoxy group at C-8 by the ethyl group in 8, which was corroborated by the HMBC correlations (Figure S31, Supplementary Materials) of H-8 with δC 201.9 (C-7) and 8.7 (C-9). Additionally, the hexose moiety was determined as d-glucose through the chiral-phase HPLC analysis of a monosaccharide produced by the hydrolysis of compound 8 (Figure S63, Supplementary Materials). The anomeric proton (δH 4.95) of hexose moiety had a large coupling constant (J = 7.4 Hz), indicating a β-configuration. Thus, the structure of 8 was defined as shown and named as 1-(3-β-d-glucopyranosyloxy)-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)propan-1-one.

Compound 9 was acquired as colorless crystals. According to the HRESIMS at m/z 481.2053 [M + Na]+, its molecular formula was inferred as C22H34O10. The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals for two aromatic protons [δH 7.06 (1H, d, J = 7.7 Hz, H-6), 6.94 (1H, d, J = 7.7 Hz, H-5)], an oxygenated methylene group [δH 4.89 (1H, overlap, H-7a), 4.58 (1H, d, J = 11.2 Hz, H-7b)], three methyl groups [δH 2.28 (3H, s, H-8), 2.25 (1H, s, H-10), 2.18 (1H, s, H-9)], and two anomeric protons [δH 4.79 (1H, d, J = 1.2 Hz, H-1′′), 4.25 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz, H-1′)]. The 13C NMR spectrum exhibited resonances for six aromatic carbons [δC 137.5 (C-4), 137.0 (C-2), 136.3 (C-3), 133.8 (C-1), 128.5 (C-6), 127.9 (C-5)], an oxygenated methylene carbon [δC 70.9 (C-7)], and three methyl groups [δC 20.9 (C-10), 15.7 (C-8, 9)]. Additionally, two anomeric carbons (δC 102.6 and 102.2), as well as ten carbon signals [δC 78.1 (C-3′), 76.9 (C-5′), 75.0 (C-2′), 74.0 (C-4′′), 72.4 (C-3′′), 72.2 (C-2′′), 71.4 (C-4′), 69.8 (C-6′), 68.1 (C-5′′), 18.1 (C-6′′)] indicated the occurrence of two sugar substituents. The hexose moieties were identified as d-glucose and l-rhamnose by chiral-phase HPLC analysis (Figure S64, Supplementary Materials). Moreover, the anomeric proton (δH 4.25) of d-glucose had a large coupling constant (J = 7.8 Hz), and the anomeric proton (δH 4.79) of l-rhamnose had a small coupling constant (J = 1.2 Hz), which suggested the configurations of the anomeric carbons of d-glucose and l-rhamnose were β and α, respectively. In the HMBC spectrum, the anomeric proton of the d-glucose unit showed a correlation with C-7, and the anomeric proton of the l-rhamnose unit was correlated with the C-6′ of d-glucose unit. These NMR data mentioned above were similar to those of compound 14 [16], except for the presence of three methyl groups. The three methyl groups were respectively located at C-2, C-3, and C-4, which was determined by the key HMBC correlations from the methyl protons at δH 2.28 to C-1, C2, and C-3, from the methyl protons at δH 2.18 to C-3 and C-4, and from the methyl protons at δH 2.25 to C-4 and C-5 (Figure 2). Based on these data, the structure of compound 9 was identified and named as 2,3,4-trimethylbenzylalcohol-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(6→1)-β-d-glucopyranoside.

Fifteen known compounds were identified as bakuchiol (3) [17], 1,3-hydroxybakuchiol (4) [17], 15-demetyl-12,13-dihydro-13-ketobakuchiol (5) [17], 3,2-hydroxybakuchiol (6) [17], 12,13-diolbakuchiol (7) [18], 2,3,4-trimethylbenzylalcohol-O-β-d-glucopyranoside acid (10) [19], p-cymen-7-yloxy-β-d-glucopyranoside (11) [20], methyl di-O-methyl-O-glucosylgallate (12) [15], methyl 4-(β-d-glucopyranosyloxy)-3-methoxybenzoate (13) [21], benzyl α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-d-glucopyranoside (14) [16], 2-phenylethyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (15) [22], 3,5-dihydroxyestragole 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (16) [23], 5-O-feruloylquinic acid methyl ester (17) [24], butyl(4-β-d-glucopyranosyloxy-phenyl)acetate (18) [25], and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (19) [26].

2.2. Biological Activity

The isolates 1–19 were screened for their inhibitory effects on PASMCs’ abnormal proliferation induced by hypoxia in vitro. As shown in Figure 4, compared with the normal (NC) group, the proliferation rate of PASMCs in the model (M) group was significantly increased (p < 0.01). Compared with the M group, the proliferation rates of the compounds 3, 6, 9–10, 12, and 17 groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.01), which indicated that compounds 3, 6, 9–10, 12, and 17 can significantly inhibit the abnormal proliferation of PASMCs at 5 μM. Then, these cells were treated with the compounds (3, 6, 9–10, 12, and 17) with different concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μM). Compounds 3, 6, 9–10, 12, and 17 suppressed the abnormal proliferation of PASMCs, with IC50 values of 56.3 ± 0.5, 10.7 ± 0.65, 57.1 ± 1.1, 44.0 ± 0.75, 41.5 ± 0.87, and 35.3 ± 0.42 μM, respectively. Notably, the comparison of compounds 8 and 12 showed that the methoxy fragment connected to C-8 may be responsible for the inhibition. Additionally, compounds 9 and 10 exhibited an inhibitory effect in contrast to compounds 14 and 15, which might be attributed to the presence of a 2,3,4-trimethylphenyl group.

Pharmacological studies have shown that deoxypodophyllotoxin isolated from A. sylvestris possesses antitumor, antibacterial, and antiviral activities [7,8,27,28], which has led to the pharmacological effects of A. sylvestris being mainly focused on antitumor effects, with less research and attention paid to other pharmacological effects. In this study, the inhibitory effects of compounds isolated from A. sylvestris on the hypoxia-induced cell proliferation of PASMCs were investigated for the first time. The preliminary results of this experiment have an important potential value for future development and research on A. sylvestris.

Briefly, the PASMCs were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were divided into the normal group (NC), model group (M), and treatment groups (isolated compounds). Then, the MTT assay was performed as previously described [12]. All data were analyzed by SPSS software version 26.0 (IBM, New York, NY, USA) and presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Concentration-response analysis was performed to determine the compound concentrations required to inhibit the growth of cells by 50% (IC50) using GraphPad Prism 8.02 software.

4. Conclusions

Four new compounds (1–2, 8, and 9), together with fifteen known analogs were isolated from the roots of A. sylvestris. All compounds were isolated from the plant for the first time, which greatly enriches the chemical content of this plant. In preliminary in vitro bioassays, the results showed that 3, 6, 9–10, 12, and 17 exhibited anti-proliferation effects on hypoxia-induced PASMCs’ cell proliferation, suggesting that they may further act as potential lead molecules for the development of therapeutic agents for PAH. Then, we will discover more bioactive compounds from A. sylvestris and carry out further research on the mechanism with potential compounds for the treatment of PAH.
