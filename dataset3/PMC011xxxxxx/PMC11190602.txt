pmc1 Introduction

Immunity is the common terminology in modern medicine. It is the physiological function of the body's immune system to recognize “oneself” and “non-self” and eliminate “non-self” in order to maintain the stability of the body's internal environment. Through immunity, the body can resist and eliminate the invasion of foreign pathogens, neutralize toxins, and eliminate the damage, senescence, and mutated cells in the body [1]. Immunity is the kind of active defense mechanism of human body, which is of great significance in maintaining physiological and vital activities [2]

Under the normal physiological conditions, the immune system of the body relies on its innate immunity and acquired adaptive immunity to play the immune function together, so that the physiological function of the body is kept in the relatively stable state. If the body's immune function is abnormal, it will lead to adverse consequences such as allergic reaction, low immunity and so on. Studies have proved that people with low immunity are more vulnerable to the diseases and are not easy to recover, in the long term, which will increase the risk of serious diseases in the population in the long run [3,4]

With the acceleration of the pace of modern life and the increasingly fierce social competition, the decline of immunity has gradually become the hidden danger in the life of modern people [5]. In addition, with the popularization of organ transplantation, the increase of the incidence of malignant tumors, and the appearance of the aging population, the number of people in the state of immune hypofunction keeps rising. Immunosuppression is particularly harmful to children and the elderly [6,7]. Therefore, the research and development of safe and efficient immunomodulatory drugs to improve people's immunity has important clinical significance

At present, most of the immune enhancers used in clinic are synthetic drugs, which not only improve the immunity of the body, but also have certain toxic and side effects. A number of studies have found that some traditional Chinese medicines have natural immune enhancement effects [8]. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) are mostly natural plants, which have some advantages of low drug resistance, little toxic and side effects, few adverse reactions and no dependence. In the process of disease prevention and treatment, predecessors accumulated a lot of experience in TCM compatibility, which laid the foundation for the research and development of TCM as immune enhancer. In recent years, with the development of immunopharmacology and chemistry of TCM and people's pursuit of quality of life, the research and development of new multi-effect immune enhancers is increasingly urgent. A large number of research results showed that TCM and ingredients could enhance and restore the immune function of the body, and had broad application prospects in the aspects of inflammation, anti-immune damage, anti-tumor, anti-aging and so on [[9], [10], [11], [12]].

Dangdi oral liquid (DDO) is a representative prescription based on the improvement of immunity in TCM theory, which has been clinically used for many years in the Hunan Children's Hospital. DDO was mainly composed of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Danggui), Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. (Dihuang), Achyranthes bidentata Bl. (Niuxi), Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Gancao). Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels could nourish blood, promote blood circulation to relieve pain. Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. could nourish Yin and supplement blood, supplement essence and marrow. Achyranthes bidentata Bl. Could tonify the liver and kidney, strengthen the muscles and bones. Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. could tonify spleen and qi, expel phlegm and relieve cough, relieve heat and detoxification, alleviate medicinal properties. DDO has shown positive effects in clinical study, but its effective components and mechanism remain elusive. In the present study, the chemical compositions of DDO were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Additionally, the immune activity of DDO was measured in 6 aspects, which were the measurement of cellular immune function (including lymphocyte proliferation test and delayed allergic reaction test); the measurement of humoral immune function (including antibody producing cell test); the measurement of mucosal immune function (sIgA content); the measurement of macrophage phagocytic function (including neutral red phagocytosis test and mouse carbon clearance test); the measurement of natural killer cell (NK cell) activity (lactate dehydrogenase LDH assay) and the measurement of immune organ index. This study not only clarifies the material basis of DDO to improve the immunity, but also provides the new ideas and theoretical foundation for future researching the pharmacological mechanism of DDO.

4 Discussion

The compatibility of different traditional Chinese medicines in prescription contributes to enhancing the efficiency [21]. The mechanism of prescription might be related to the changes of the content and form of chemicals caused by the interaction among ingredients [22]. For example, Zhi-Zi-Chi decoction was comprised of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis and Semen sojae preparatum, which generated two new kinds of chemicals (jasminoside A and jasminoside I) and eight components disappeared (such as genipin, crocin III and so on) compared with single medicine. Moreover, the contents of six kinds of components were increased after the compatibility [23]. Therefore, the composition of DDO is not only the sum of three single medicines, so it was necessary to further investigate the compound changes after compatibility. At present, UPLC-Q-TOF/MS technology was widely used to analyze the medicine components because of its great efficiency and the potency for structural characterization [24]. Therefore, UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was applied to analyze the compounds in DDO. The results showed that 51 compounds were identified. It contained 26 flavonoids, 5 triterpenoids, 5 alkaloids, 4 glycosides, 3 coumarins, 2 organic acids, 2 esters and 4 other compounds. These compounds may be the active ingredients of DDO for improving the immunity. However, this study only carried out the qualitative analysis, and the quantitative measurement of the bioactive ingredients will be completed in the future

Immune system is the body's defense against foreign antigenic substances. In the immune response, non-specific immunity and specific immune response usually play the role together. Among them, specific immunity includes cellular immunity and humoral immunity. The level of immune function directly affects the strength of the body's resistance to disease and the prognosis of the disease [25]. Lymphocytes macrophages and NK cells are the important immune cells, and to investigate their changes is the important methods to directly evaluate the effects of drugs on immune regulation of the body

Lymphocytes are produced by lymphoid organs. When stimulated by foreign antigens such as ConA, LPS and so on, mature lymphocytes can show transformation phenomena such as volume increase and division. B and T lymphocyte are both important for immunologic response in organism. T lymphocyte possesses mediating cellular immunity as well as adjusting immunity. B lymphocyte mainly participates in the humoral immunity. Proliferation of lymphocyte is the most immediate index of reflecting organic immunity [26]. The experimental results showed that the absorbance value of DDO group was significant than control group, which indicated that DDO could significantly promote the proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo, and the medium dose possessed the best efficacy in vivo. Many studies have proved that traditional Chinese medicine and its ingredients and compounds had the better effect on promoting lymphocyte proliferation [26,27]

Macrophages, known as an important cell in non-specific immunity, are found throughout bodily tissues and play an important role in the immune system. Upon activation by foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses, macrophages become more efficient in eliminating pathogens, in comparison to their dormant state [28]. Macrophages are involved in phagocytosis, secretion of inflammatory mediators, and T cell activation [29]. In addition, activated macrophage secrete cytotoxic proteins, which play a role in the destruction of cancer, viruses, and bacteria within cells ([30]). Known as phagocytes, the phagocytosis ability of macrophage could be used to judge the non-specific immune function of the body. The experimental results proved that DDO could significantly improve the phagocytosis ability of macrophage in vitro and in vivo by natural red and carbon clearance test. Many studies have showed that traditional Chinese medicine and its ingredients and compounds had the better effect on improve the phagocytosis ability of macrophage [8,31]

NK cells are the special class of lymphocytes in the immune system that can be activated to mediate cytotoxic activity and produce the high levels of cytokines and chemokines involved in non-specific antiviral defense mechanisms [32]. In addition, NK cells have broad prospects in improving hematopoietic and organ transplantation, promoting anti-tumor immunotherapy, and controlling inflammation and autoimmune diseases [33,34]. The experimental results showed that three dosage groups of DDO could significantly improve the activity of NK cells, suggesting that DDO could improve the immune capacity of the body by enhancing the activity of these immune-related cells, and played an important role in disease prevention

The hemolytic plaque assay of spleen was used to detect the function of antibody forming cells in animals. Mice are immunized by intraperitoneal injection of sheep red blood cells, which could induce the mouse lymphocytes to produce specific antibodies, with the participation of lymphocytes and complement, the antibodies co-incubation with sheep red blood cells could produce hemolytic phenomenon and form hemolytic plaque [15,35]. It reflects the ability of cells to secrete antibodies, which belongs to the humoral immune response [36]. The results showed that DDO could increase the number of hemolytic plaques formed by the splenic lymphocytes of mice. Because the increase in the number of hemolytic plaques was proportional to the amount of antibodies formed by cells, it was proved that DDO could increase the number of antibodies in mice, and thus improve the humoral immunity function of mice

Delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction is the cellular immune response induced by antigen in the body. After specific antigen is re-exposed to sensitized T cells under the action of antigen presenting cells, T cells are activated, proliferated and differentiated into effector T cells, which further clear the antigen and cause the inflammation in local tissues [37]. After stimulation, visible and palpable swelling began to appear at 24 h. The cellular immune function of the organism could be evaluated by measuring the degree of swelling and comparing it with unstimulation. The experimental results showed that DDO could improve the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction of mice, suggesting that DDO could improve the cellular immune response

Mucosal immune system is an important part of the body's immune network, is an important link of the body to resist infection, which constitutes the body's first line of defense against infection. Mucosal immune system mainly plays a role by producing secretory IgA (SIgA), which can neutralize pathogens, toxins and other harmful substances in mucosal epithelium and capture pathogens in the intermucosal layer [38]. sIgA antibody can not only inhibit the adhesion of pathogenic microorganisms, but also obstruct the interaction between pathogenic microorganisms and epithelial cells through the form of cross-linking polymers. It is the biological barrier to isolate the combination of pathogenic microorganisms and epithelial cells, and can prevent pathogens from invading the body [39,40]. In this study, sIgA antibody levels in the small intestinal mucosa and pulmonary mucosa of mice were measured. The results showed that DDO could stimulate the production of sIgA antibody in immunized mice. This suggested that DDO could stimulate mucosal immunity in mice

5 Conclusion

In this study, the chemical compounds of DDO were identified by UPLC-QTOF/MS method, and the immune activity was measured. The results showed that 51 compounds were identified. In addition, DDO could significantly improve the non-specific immunity and specific immune response. Although the effective material basis for DDO to improve immunity was clarified in this study, more researches are required for further explanation for the potential mechanism of different components in DDO.
