The molecular mechanisms underlying diversity in animal behavior are not well understood. A major experimental challenge is determining the contribution of genetic variants that affect neuronal gene expression to differences in behavioral traits. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the neuroendocrine transforming growth factor–β ligand, DAF-7, regulates diverse behavioral responses to bacterial food and pathogens. The dynamic neuron-specific expression of daf-7 is modulated by environmental and endogenous bacteria-derived cues. Here, we investigated natural variation in the expression of daf-7 from the ASJ pair of chemosensory neurons. We identified common genetic variants in gap-2, encoding a Ras guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating protein homologous to mammalian synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein, which modify daf-7 expression cell nonautonomously and promote exploratory foraging behavior in a partially DAF-7–dependent manner. Our data connect natural variation in neuron-specific gene expression to differences in behavior and suggest that genetic variation in neuroendocrine signaling pathways mediating host-microbe interactions may give rise to diversity in animal behavior.

Molecular basis of natural variation in foraging behavior is revealed by genetic variants that modulate neuronal gene expression.

The molecular characterization of natural variants that affect behavioral traits provides a starting point to understand the cellular and organismal mechanisms driving diversity in behavior (1–3). How variation in gene expression might be manifest in differences in behavior has been relatively unexplored in part because the relationship between neuronal gene expression and behavioral states is not well understood. Activity-dependent neuronal transcription has been shown to have pivotal roles in the development and plasticity of neural circuits, but less is known about how changes in gene expression play a role in shaping behavioral states (4). Moreover, whereas variation in levels of gene expression have been readily quantified on a genome-wide scale across evolutionarily diverse organisms in many tissues, including the nervous system, mechanistically bridging changes in levels of gene expression to differences in phenotypic traits has continued to be a major challenge (5–8).

In Caenorhabditis elegans, a neuroendocrine transforming growth factor–β ligand, DAF-7, controls the dauer developmental decision (9, 10) and diverse aspects of physiology including feeding and foraging behaviors (10–16). Neuron-specific expression of daf-7 is modulated by endogenous and environmental bacterial cues (9, 10, 16–21), and we have observed that expression of daf-7 from the ASJ pair of chemosensory neurons is differentially regulated in a range of physiological contexts (16, 18, 21). We showed that secondary metabolites produced by pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced daf-7 expression in the ASJ neurons, promoting avoidance behavior and increased roaming activity (16, 18). In addition, we observed that male C. elegans were observed to up-regulate expression of daf-7 from the ASJ neurons upon the onset of reproductive maturity, promoting bacterial food-leaving mate-searching behavior (21). Most recently, we observed that expression of daf-7 from the ASJ neurons of adult hermaphrodite animals was regulated by interoceptive bacteria-derived cues from ingested food, defining a feedback loop mechanism that governs foraging behavior in response to the ingestion of bacterial food (16). Our studies have established that daf-7 neuroendocrine gene expression modulates foraging behavior of C. elegans in response to environmental and internal cues from pathogenic and nutritional bacteria, and moreover, the expression of daf-7 from the ASJ neurons is correlated with internal state favoring exploratory behavior (16). Here, we investigated genetic variation in daf-7 expression from the ASJ neurons among wild strains of C. elegans, connecting differences in neuronal gene expression to diversity in foraging behavior that is manifest in natural populations.

RESULTS

We surveyed a set of wild strains of C. elegans for relative levels of daf-7 expression in the ASJ neurons while feeding on the standard laboratory bacterial food Escherichia coli OP50. Previously, we found that for the laboratory wild-type strain N2 from Bristol, England, hermaphrodites do not exhibit detectable daf-7 expression in ASJ neurons when feeding on E. coli OP50, but we have observed dynamic daf-7 ASJ expression under different conditions, including the observation of daf-7 ASJ expression in N2 hermaphrodites exposed to P. aeruginosa PA14 (18) and in N2 males feeding on E. coli OP50 (21). A genome-wide analysis of whole-animal gene expression levels across wild strains showed variation in daf-7 expression (8). We observed a wide range of expression levels of daf-7 in the ASJ neurons among wild strains sampled, with N2 exhibiting the lowest (undetectable) level of daf-7 ASJ expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Our survey was conducted using strains generated from a cross of an integrated transgenic multicopy fluorescent reporter under the control of the daf-7 promoter (derived from the N2 strain) into each wild-strain background. Our experimental approach thus precluded the observation of variation in daf-7 expression due to local cis-acting loci because the reporter only had the regulatory regions of the N2 daf-7 gene.

Identification of natural variants in gap-2 modulating daf-7 expression in the ASJ neurons

To define a molecular basis of natural variation in daf-7 ASJ expression, we focused on differences in daf-7 ASJ expression between N2 and MY18, a strain isolated from Münster, Germany. We generated 123 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from multiple crosses between the N2- and MY18-derived strains (Fig. 2A) and quantified levels of daf-7 ASJ expression in each RIL strain (Fig. 2B). RIL sequencing of MY18 was used to identify 5716 variants that differed between the two parent strains (N2 and MY18), and a linkage mapping pointed to a broad quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome X that contributed 11.5% of the observed differences in daf-7 ASJ expression (Fig. 2C). In parallel, starting with an MY18-derived strain, we carried out multiple backcrosses with N2, selecting at each generation for the expression of daf-7 ASJ expression, yielding near-isogenic lines (NILs) in the N2 genetic background defining a 447-kb interval on chromosome X: 9,513,008 to X: 9,960,248 containing an MY18-derived locus that conferred increased daf-7 ASJ expression in adult hermaphrodites feeding on E. coli OP50 (Fig. 2D).

To identify the specific nucleotide differences contributing to the differential daf-7 ASJ expression between the N2 and MY18 strains, we adopted a candidate variant approach, examining nucleotide differences predicted to cause coding changes in the 18 genes present in the narrowed interval on chromosome X. One of these genes was gap-2, encoding a conserved Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) homologous to the synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein (SynGAP) family. We identified a candidate variant present in MY18 that was predicted to affect an exon specific to two of the alternatively spliced isoforms of gap-2, gap-2g, and gap-2j and cause a putative substitution of a threonine in place of the serine at position 64 of GAP-2G and GAP-2J. First, we observed that a strain carrying the gap-2(tm748) deletion allele in the N2 background exhibited up-regulated daf-7 ASJ expression in adult hermaphrodite animals feeding on E. coli OP50 (Fig. 3G), leading us to evaluate the effect of the 64T variant in the N2 background. We observed that a strain carrying the gap-2(syb4046) allele, which had been engineered to carry the S64T change in the g-/j- isoforms of gap-2 in the N2 genetic background, exhibited increased daf-7 ASJ expression on E. coli OP50 (Fig. 3, B and C). Conversely, when we examined the effect of engineering the T64S reciprocal change into the MY18 genetic background, we observed that daf-7 ASJ expression decreased compared to what was observed in the MY18 strain (Fig. 3D). These data established that the S64T change in GAP-2 G-/J- isoforms caused increased daf-7 ASJ expression. We observed that the gap-2(syb4046) allele causes a dominant phenotype (Fig. 3F), where the gap-2(tm748) heterozygote conferred an intermediate level of daf-7 ASJ expression compared to the wild-type or gap-2(tm748) homozygous strains (Fig. 3G).

We observed that 48 other wild strains carry the 64T variant (Table 1) (22). On the basis of the putative alteration of specifically gap-2g and gap-2j isoforms by the 64T variants, we examined whether other variants present in the affected exon specific to gap-2g and gap-2j isoforms might also influence daf-7 ASJ expression. We found that 24 wild strains harbor a variant that causes a putative S11L change (Table 1). To test the functional consequences of the S11L substitution in GAP-2, we generated the gap-2(syb6873) allele, in which the 11L variant was engineered in the N2 genetic background and observed that the 11L variant also conferred increased daf-7 ASJ expression to a degree comparable to what was conferred by the 64T variant (Fig. 3H).

We observed that the effect of the gap-2 variants on daf-7 ASJ expression was large relative to a small increase in daf-7 ASJ expression conferred by the npr-1 (215F) change (fig. S1). We also noted that the gap-2 variants did not cause a change in daf-7 expression from the ASI pair of chemosensory neurons (fig. S2).

gap-2 natural variants causing differences in a foraging behavioral trait

Having established that two gap-2 variants promoted daf-7 ASJ expression, we sought to connect these variants that alter gene expression to corresponding daf-7–dependent behavioral traits. C. elegans exhibits a two-state foraging behavior that alternates between an exploratory roaming state and an exploitative dwelling state on bacterial food (11, 23). A QTL affecting exp-1 (24) and a laboratory-derived mutation in npr-1 (25) have been previously shown to modify the proportion of time that animals spend in the roaming and dwelling states. daf-7 mutants have been shown to spend an increased proportion of time in the dwelling state compared to the N2 wild-type strain (11, 16). Recently, we have shown that the expression of daf-7 in the ASJ neurons is part of a dynamic gene expression feedback loop that promotes increased duration of the roaming state (16).

We observed that the MY18 strain exhibited a marked increase in the proportion of time spent in the roaming state relative to the N2 strain (Fig. 4, A, D, and H). The ancestral 215F allele of npr-1 is known to contribute to increased roaming behavior when compared to the N2 strain that carries a laboratory-derived 215V mutation in npr-1 (25). To examine the effect of the 64T gap-2 variant on foraging behavior, we observed the strain carrying the gap-2(syb4046) 64T allele in the N2 genetic background and found this strain spent an increased proportion of time in the roaming state relative to the N2 strain (Fig. 4, A, B, and H). In addition, we observed that the strain carrying the gap-2(syb4684) 64S allele in the MY18 genetic background spent a decreased proportion of time in the roaming state (Fig. 4, D, E, and H). These data establish that the 64T variant in gap-2 promotes an increase in the proportion of time that the animal is in the roaming state relative to the dwelling state when compared with the 64S allele of gap-2 in the N2 or MY18 genetic backgrounds. We also observed that the strain carrying the gap-2 allele with the 11L variant, gap-2(syb6873), in the N2 genetic background also increased the proportion of time that animals spent in the roaming state, to a degree comparable to what was observed for the 64T variant in the N2 background (Fig. 4, A, C, and H). We also ruled out that a large defect in feeding and growth might account for the marked effect of the variants on roaming behavior. The gap-2(syb4046) and gap-2(syb6873) animals exhibited a ~20% decrease in pharyngeal pumping rate and wild-type rates of growth and development (fig. S4). Our data identify two distinct variants acting on the same exon specific to gap-2g and gap-2j isoforms having comparable effects on daf-7 ASJ expression and foraging behavior.

gap-2 variants causing differences in foraging behavior by modifying daf-7 neuroendocrine gene expression

To determine whether the gap-2 variants modified roaming behavior by their effects on daf-7 ASJ expression, we first examined the roaming and dwelling behavior of the strain carrying the T64 gap-2 variant and a loss-of-function daf-7 allele in the N2 genetic background. We observed that this gap-2(syb4046); daf-7(ok3125) double mutant exhibited diminished roaming behavior compared with a strain carrying only the gap-2(syb4046) allele in the N2 background (Fig. 4, F, G, and H). Next, we examined the roaming behavior of a strain carrying the gap-2(syb4046) allele and a floxed daf-7 locus, with and without a transgene expressing Cre under an ASJ-specific (trx-1p) promoter. We observed a diminished proportion of roaming behavior in the animals carrying a selective knockout of daf-7 from the ASJ neurons (Fig. 4, I to K). These data suggest that the effect of the gap-2(syb4046) variant on daf-7 ASJ expression contributes to the foraging behavior trait difference between the N2 and MY18 strains, although the partial suppression of the increased roaming conferred by the gap-2(syb4046) variant suggests that the variant might also act through DAF-7–independent mechanisms to promote roaming behavior.

gap-2 variants acting cell nonautonomously to modulate neuroendocrine gene expression and foraging behavior

To determine the site of action where gap-2 variants modify neuroendocrine gene expression and foraging behavior, we first defined the expression pattern of gap-2 by green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagging endogenous GAP-2 at its C terminus. We observed expression in multiple cells of the nervous system (fig. S4), consistent with prior reports of the tissue expression pattern of gap-2 (26). To determine the cells in which the g- and j- isoforms of gap-2 were expressed, we inserted a stop codon in the exon preceding the first exon of the g- and j- isoforms, which was expected to cause only translation of GFP-tagged G- and J- isoforms of GAP-2 (Fig. 5, A and B). This strain exhibited GFP expression in the sensillar endings of the ADE neuron pair based on cell location and morphology (Fig. 5B). We confirmed expression of the G- and J- isoforms of GFP-tagged GAP-2 in the ADE neuron pair through colocalization with the expression of the dat-1p::mCherry transgene that was expressed in the ADE neuron pair (Fig. 5C).

Orange line has been determined on total N2 data and used for analysis of all the strains.

We used the expression pattern information to determine the neurons in which expression of the T64 variant of GAP-2 was sufficient to confer increased daf-7 ASJ expression and roaming behavior. Because the 64T variant causes a dominant effect on daf-7 expression, we used a transgene expressing the gap-2g-isoform cDNA carrying the 64T variant under the control of the pan-neuronal rgef-1 promoter in the N2 genetic background. We also expressed the gap-2g-isoform cDNA carrying the 64T variant under the control of the ADE neuronal dat-1 promoter in the N2 background. We observed that the expression of the 64T GAP-2 sequence under the control of both pan-neuronal and ADE neuronal promoters, in the N2 genetic background, conferred daf-7 ASJ expression (Fig. 5, D and E) and an increased proportion of time spent in the roaming state (Fig. 5, F to J). These data suggested that expression of the GAP-2 variant in the ADE neurons was sufficient to act cell nonautonomously to alter the expression of daf-7 from the ASJ neurons and to modify foraging behavior.

Prevalence and geographical distribution of gap-2 variants

The 64T gap-2 variant is present in 48 of 550 isotype reference strains in the Caenorhabditis Natural Diversity Resource (22), whereas the 11L gap-2 variant is found in 24 of these strains. We also identified two additional rare variants, ENN39E and P19S, which are also predicted to affect the g- and j- isoforms of gap-2. We examined the geographic origins of these 72 wild strains and observed enrichment for the T64 allele in Africa and Europe (Fig. 6A). We found that the 11L and ENN39E variants have also been observed in divergent strains from the Hawaiian Islands. Because daf-7 expression is affected by the bacterial diet, we investigated enrichment in specific natural substrates and found that the T64 variant was more often found in strains isolated from compost as compared strains isolated from rotting fruit or leaf litter (Fig. 6B).

DISCUSSION

Our data illustrate how changes in neuronal gene expression caused by natural variants underlie the mechanism by which the variants can exert differential effects on behavioral traits. In particular, we show that natural variants cause differences in behavior by cell-nonautonomously modulating expression levels of a neuroendocrine regulatory ligand in two neurons of C. elegans. The systematic analysis of gene expression as a quantitative trait has been generally conducted on a genome-wide scale enabled by RNA sequencing–based methodology (8). Our focus on the expression of a single gene enabled us to use a transgenic fluorescent reporter to examine levels of neuron-specific expression in live animals and facilitated subsequent mapping and molecular characterization. Roles for neuromodulators in shaping circuits that govern behavior have been implicated from genetic studies (27, 28), and our data suggest that variants causing differences in expression levels of genes that encode neuromodulators represent candidate variants that cause differences in behavior. In the current study, our focus on natural variation in daf-7 expression from the ASJ neurons was also motivated by our prior work establishing that daf-7 ASJ expression levels are strongly correlated with internal state favoring exploratory behavior (16).

GAP-2 is one of three GAPs in the C. elegans genome that stimulate the LET-60 Ras GTPase to reduce epidermal growth factor signaling (26, 29). GAP-2 is orthologous to disabled homolog 2-interacting protein (DAB2IP), a member of the SynGAP family of GAPs, which has been implicated in a range of disease states (30, 31) The similar dominant effects on daf-7 ASJ expression for both of the 64T and 11L natural variants as compared to the recessive effects of a deletion of gap-2 suggest that 64T and 11L variants confer reduced GAP-2 activity. We speculate that the 64T and 11L GAP-2G and/or GAP-2J isoforms act as dominant-negative proteins that might bind to LET-60 but not activate the GTPase and compete with wild-type GAP-2. Both let-60(n1046) gain-of-function and let-60(n2021) reduction-of-function alleles exhibit pronounced locomotory phenotypes in the presence of bacterial food (32), precluding the analysis of genetic interactions between gap-2 and let-60, but the presence of locomotory defects is consistent with gap-2 affecting Ras signaling in the ADE neurons to alter foraging behavior. Alterations in Ras signaling in the ADE neurons may also modify dopamine-dependent or PDF-1–dependent signaling that have been shown to have activity in the ADE neurons (33, 34), which may act cell nonautonomously to modulate daf-7 ASJ expression in the ASJ neurons. Our data also illustrate how the presence of multiple alternatively spliced transcripts of gap-2 might facilitate the emergence of genetic variants that exert effects in a restricted set of neurons. Whereas GAP-2 appears to be widely expressed in the nervous system and in other tissues, the GAP-G and/or GAP-2J isoforms exhibit restricted expression in the ADE pair of sensory neurons, and two variants, both 64T and 11L, affect an exon specific to these two isoforms.

The genetic variants in gap-2 that modulate daf-7 expression from the ASJ neurons and promote roaming behavior are found in many strains throughout the C. elegans species, suggesting that the variants may confer a fitness advantage in diverse bacterial environments. The enrichment of these gap-2 variants in strains isolated from compost relative to strains isolated from rotting fruit or leaf litter substrates is intriguing because C. elegans isolated from compost are more commonly found as dauer larvae (35). We speculate that animals carrying gap-2 variants conferring increased exploratory behavior might gain an advantage in compost environments that are enriched for dauer larvae. Our data suggest that diversity in behavioral traits associated with host interactions with microbes (36) can emerge from variants affecting the regulation of neuronal gene expression that is modulated by bacteria-derived food and pathogen cues.

daf-7p::GFP expressing wild isolate strain construction

To generate daf-7p::GFP carrying natural isolate reporter strains, each wild strain of interest was initially crossed to FK181 to introduce the ksIs2 transgene. Progeny carrying the transgene were then backcrossed to the parental wild strain eight times.

NIL construction

ZD1271 was made by backcrossing the ZD841 eight times to FK181 by following the daf-7p::GFP expression in ASJ phenotype. ZD2589 was made by crossing the ZD1271 with FK181 and then screening the strains for having N2 genotype region in between the Chr. X 9.5 to 14 Mb. ZD2626 was made by crossing ZD2589 with FK181 and then screening the strains for having N2 genotype in between Chr. X 9.5 to 12 Mb. ZD2627 was made by crossing ZD2589 with FK181 and then screening the strains for having N2 genotype in Chr. X 1.7 to 8.9 Mb. ZD2671 was made by crossing ZD2589 with FK181 and then screening the strains for having N2 genotype in between Chr. X 9.5 to 10 Mb.

Linkage mapping

daf-7p::GFP expression in RILs were measured, and whole-genome sequencing results of each RIL strain were used for linkage mapping. A total of 123 RILs were examined for the level of daf-7p::GFP expression in ASJ neurons as described above. Linkage mapping was performed for daf-7p::GFP expression in ASJ neurons using R package linkage mapping (www.github.com/AndersenLab/linkagemapping as previously described (37). QTLs were detected using the fsearch function. This function calculates the logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for each genetic marker and each trait as −n[ln(1 − R2)/2ln(10)] where R is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the RIL genotypes at the marker and trait values (38). A threshold for significance based on a 5% genome-wide error rate was calculated. QTLs were identified as the marker with the highest LOD score above the significance threshold. This marker was then integrated into the model as a cofactor, and mapping was repeated until no significant QTLs were detected. The annotated lods function was used to calculate the effect size of each QTL. Confidence intervals (95%) were defined by a 1.5-LOD drop from the peak marker.

daf-7p::GFP expression imaging

For quantification of daf-7 expression in animals, day 1 young adult animals were mounted and anesthetized in levamisole. The animals were imaged at 40× using a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope. Fifteen to 20 animals were imaged for each condition or strain. For quantification, maximum intensity values of GFP within the ASJ neurons were calculated using FIJI software (39).

Roaming/dwelling assay

Day 1 adults were placed on 10-cm Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plates, on which fresh OP50 had been uniformly spread the day before the experiment. These plates contained a 6-cm copper ring to keep the animals within the field of view for recording. The worms were transferred to inside of the ring on the assay plates 40 min before to move to worm tracker to avoid the initial reaction of worms to picking and transfer. On average, 10 worms were recorded. We recorded the region inside the copper ring at 3.75 frames per second for 90 min. Videos were analyzed using MBF Biosciences WormLab software. Speed and mid body bending angle were averaged over 10-s intervals. Values for each 10-s interval were plotted on a scatter plot of speed (y axis) and bending angle (x axis). Quantification of fraction of time spent roaming was done by the diagonal line whose placement was based on the distribution of points of the distribution of N2. Equation for this line is y = 0.3*x + 5. Points falling above the line were classified as roaming, and those points below the line were classified as dwelling.

Statistics

All statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software. Statistical tests used for each experiment are listed in the figure legend.
