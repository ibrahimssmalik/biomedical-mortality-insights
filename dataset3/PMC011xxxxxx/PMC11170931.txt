Background

The prevalence of obesity in combination with sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength or physical function, is on the rise among adults aged 65 years and older. A significant portion of this demographic now falls under the classification of sarcopenic obesity, a high-risk geriatric syndrome predominantly seen in an aging population vulnerable to compounded complications from both sarcopenia and obesity. It is essential to promptly evaluate the impact of academic research in this field, taking into account factors such as geographical regions, authors, journals, and institutions. Furthermore, exploring current topics and identifying potential areas that could inspire future researchers to conduct additional studies is crucial for advancing overall health in this population.

Methodology

A search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection database to identify English language articles and reviews focusing on sarcopenic obesity in older adults, published between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2023. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer (v.1.6.18) and CiteSpace (v.6.1.R2).

Results

A total of 985 original English-language articles were collected, consisting of 783 articles and 202 reviews. The volume of research publications in this field has shown significant growth since 2012. The United States leads in contributions, with 239 articles (24.3% of the total) and the highest number of citations at 18,403, along with the highest total link strength. The University of Melbourne in Australia stands out with 25 published articles (2.5% of the total). University of Verona in Italy has the most citations at 9,405, and Monash University in Australia has the highest total link strength at 53. Among prolific authors, John A. Batsis from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is the most productive with 24 articles (2.4% of the total). The journal "Nutrients" has the most articles on sarcopenic obesity in older adults, publishing 54 articles (5.5% of the total). Key topics in this area include sarcopenia, obesity, sarcopenic obesity, and elderly. Recent interventions focus on "nutrition" and "exercise" for sarcopenic obesity in older adults.

Conclusions

Research on sarcopenic obesity in older adults has seen significant growth on a global scale from 2004 to 2023, indicating a promising area for further study with potential benefits from current advancements. Although academic inquiries have shed light on various aspects of sarcopenic obesity in older adults, there remains a noticeable dearth of clinical research and evidence-based medicine on the effective management of this condition in elderly individuals. Future studies could focus on developing tailored interventions for older adults with sarcopenic obesity.

The prevalence of sarcopenia and obesity has been on the rise due to global urbanization, aging, and changes in lifestyles, making it a significant public health concern worldwide. Sarcopenia, initially characterized by age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and strength, now encompasses factors like chronic diseases, physical inactivity, movement disorders, and poor nutrition that contribute to muscle loss. On the other hand, obesity is a chronic condition marked by a substantial increase in total adipose tissue and/or visceral fat mass, leading to detrimental health effects. Severe cases of sarcopenia and obesity together exacerbate metabolic disorders and elevate the risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, disability, and fractures. This combination is also linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and other metabolic conditions, influencing their onset, progression, and mortality [1]. The co-occurrence of sarcopenia and obesity, known as sarcopenic obesity (SO), was initially coined by Baumgartner in 2000 to characterize a state where both conditions coexist [2]. Research suggests that approximately 11% of older adults worldwide have SO, with prevalence notably rising after the age of 70 years [3].

Currently, there is a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria for SO. Furthermore, factors such as age and race can impact body composition, specifically muscle mass and body fat content, resulting in the heterogeneous diagnosis of SO. The prevailing diagnostic criteria primarily focus on the combination of sarcopenia and obesity. Sarcopenia diagnosis involves distinguishing between primary and secondary sarcopenia based on the underlying cause. Primary sarcopenia is primarily associated with age-related changes and declining bodily functions, while secondary sarcopenia can be linked to various conditions such as inflammatory diseases, osteoarthritis, neurological disorders, reduced physical activity, malnutrition, and overnutrition/obesity. The assessment of sarcopenia typically considers three key variables: SMM, muscle strength, and physical performance. Variations in diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia exist due to differences in regions and ethnic groups. The 2018 European Working Group on Sarcopenia in the Elderly recommended that the diagnosis of sarcopenia in the elderly be based on walking speed, grip strength, and appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI). ASMI is calculated as limb SMM (kg) divided by height (m) squared. Sarcopenia is diagnosed if the ASMI value is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean reference value for the young population [4]. The Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2014 consensus defined sarcopenia as the age-related loss of muscle mass, along with low muscle strength and/or low physical performance. The group specified cutoffs for each diagnostic component. In 2019, AWGS maintained the same definition of sarcopenia but made revisions to the diagnostic algorithm, protocols, and certain criteria. Low muscle strength is now defined as handgrip strength below 28 kg for men and 18 kg for women. Criteria for low physical performance include a six-meter walk speed below 1.0 m/s, a Short Physical Performance Battery score of 9 or lower, or a five-time chair stand test taking 12 seconds or longer. The original cutoffs for height-adjusted muscle mass remain unchanged: less than 7.0 kg/m2 for men using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and less than 5.4 kg/m2 for women, as well as less than 7.0 kg/m2 for men and less than 5.7 kg/m2 for women using bioimpedance. Furthermore, the AWGS 2019 update introduces distinct algorithms for community and hospital settings, both of which start with screening calf circumference (below 34 cm in men and below 33 cm in women), SARC-F (strength, assistance in walking, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and falls) score of 4 or higher, or SARC-CalF (strength, assistance in walking, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, falls, and calf circumference) score of 11 or higher to enable early identification of individuals at risk for sarcopenia [5]. It is widely acknowledged by scholars that the reduction of SMM and muscle mass plays a crucial role in the clinical diagnosis of sarcopenia, with muscle strength being considered the most reliable indicator of muscle function. The diagnosis of obesity involves a variety of methods such as BMI, waist circumference, DXA, ultrasound, CT, or bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for assessing body fat percentage, with BMI being the most commonly utilized indicator.

SO can develop subtly, with sarcopenia being easily concealed by obesity, underscoring the importance of early detection. To identify sarcopenia in patients at an early stage, it is essential to rely on a combination of multiple indicators rather than a single diagnostic criterion for improved accuracy. Screening and diagnosis of individuals suspected of having SO involve assessing an increase in BMI or waist circumference that exceeds race-specific obesity diagnostic thresholds, along with surrogate markers of sarcopenia (such as clinical symptoms or risk factors) or the completion of questionnaires (e.g., the simple five-item rating questionnaire for elderly patients) [6]. In current literature, obesity in the context of SO is commonly defined as a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and an elevated body fat percentage (≥27% or 28% for men and ≥28% for women), or specific thresholds (e.g., 35%, 38%, or 40%). Additionally, waist circumference exceeding population-specific tertiles or the World Health Organization's defined cut-off values (≥88 cm for women and ≥102 cm for men) are frequently utilized [7].

Existing studies have shown that the presence of SO is linked to a range of negative clinical outcomes. These include metabolic issues such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and reduced levels of vitamin D. Additionally, this condition is associated with geriatric syndromes like cognitive impairment, functional limitations, increased risk of falls, depressive symptoms, dementia, frailty, osteoporosis, short sleep duration, low physical activity levels, fatigue, and disability. Furthermore, SO can impact cancer outcomes and treatment by reducing overall, recurrence-free, and disease-free survival rates, increasing surgical complications and hospital length of stay, and decreasing tolerance to therapy. It also heightens the risk of mortality due to various causes, such as cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and cardiovascular surgery, as well as morbidity outcomes like hypertension, lung diseases, stroke, and arthritis. Moreover, SO is associated with the development of other clinical conditions, such as hospitalization, poor nutritional status, limited improvement in activities of daily living, dysphagia after stroke, reduced quality of life, inflammation, and poor recovery in knee flexion range of motion after total knee replacement [8]. Despite its significant importance, clinicians still lack a comprehensive understanding of SO. This article conducts a bibliometric analysis of studies related to SO in older adults from 2004 to 2023. The objective is to identify development trends, research status, and hotspots in this field, ultimately enhancing clinicians' awareness of current research on SO in older adults. By providing insights from the existing literature, this analysis aims to improve clinicians' comprehension and management skills in dealing with SO in the elderly.

Materials and methods

Ethics

The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (approval number: I-23PJ738).

Data sources and search strategies

The study utilized data exclusively from the Web of Science Core Collection database, which includes academic publications from 250 global fields [9]. This database is commonly used by researchers for bibliometric analysis. The data encompass literature published between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2023. The search query used was: TS=('the aged' OR 'the elderly' OR 'older adult' OR 'older patient' OR 'geriatric' OR 'older') AND T=('Sarcopenic Obesity'), excluding letters, reviews, conference abstracts, and other document types. Only articles or review articles in English were included in the analysis, resulting in a total of 985 relevant documents, comprising 783 articles and 202 reviews. These documents were sourced from 79 countries/regions, 324 journals, and 4,006 institutions, and were authored by 5,168 unique authors.

Data collection and bibliometric analysis

This study utilized various tools for bibliometric analysis, such as Microsoft Office Excel 2021 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA), VOSviewer (v.1.6.18), CiteSpace (v.6.1.R6), and the R package "bibliometrix" for data analysis and visualization [10]. The relevant information, including titles, authors, keywords, affiliations, countries/regions, citations, journal details, and publication dates, was extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database for a total of 2590 documents. Subsequently, the processed data were imported into VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the R package "bibliometrix" for bibliometric analysis. CiteSpace was utilized to create knowledge maps specific to the field and employ dynamic network analysis techniques to examine hot topics, trends, and frontiers within the scientific domain. Specifically, CiteSpace was used for co-occurrence and clustering analyses related to authorship, research institutions, and countries. On the other hand, VOSviewer extracted bibliographic networks (co-authorship, co-occurrence, and citation-based) from the data to analyze collaborative relationships among countries, authors, and institutions, as well as co-occurrence relationships among keywords. Bibliometrix, an open-source R package developed by Massimo Aria and Corrado Cuccurullo, was employed for comprehensive bibliometric analyses, particularly focusing on analyzing the evolving trends in keywords within the literature.

Highly cited references analysis

In the domain of research, the number of citations an article receives is a key metric for evaluating its quality and influence. Highly cited articles play a crucial role in advancing research and reflecting current research trends. Table 6 provides an overview of the top 10 most cited articles. The most cited article, "Sarcopenia: European consensus on definition and diagnosis" by Cruz-Jentoft et al. (2010), published in Age and Ageing, is a collaborative effort by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). This article refines the definition of sarcopenia, introduces relevant parameters and diagnostic indicators, and explores its connections with other diseases [12]. The second most cited article, "ESPEN guidelines on definitions and terminology of clinical nutrition" by Cederholm, T et al. (2017) in Clinical Nutrition, systematically categorizes and summarizes concepts and terms related to clinical nutrition, such as sarcopenia, frailty, overweight, and obesity [13]. This standardized classification greatly enhances understanding of clinical nutrition and encourages further exploration within the academic community. Another highly cited article, with over 1000 citations, is "Research agenda for frailty in older adults: Toward a better understanding of physiology and etiology: Summary from the American Geriatrics Society/National Institute on Aging Research Conference on Frailty in Older Adults," authored by Walston, J et al. This article delves into the concept of frailty, exploring the physiological mechanisms of sarcopenia, factors that influence it, its connections to other frailty-related conditions, and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions [14].

The relationships and trends among highly cited articles are demonstrated in Figures 13, 14. The connecting lines in Figure 13 show the connections between these influential publications [12,18-21,24-42]. Notably, the article "Sarcopenic obesity predicts instrumental activities of daily living disability in the elderly" by Baumgartner, RN et al. in 2004 [18] has been a key work in the field of SO in the elderly over the last two decades. This publication has influenced subsequent research and inspired the comprehensive article "Sarcopenic obesity in older adults: aetiology, epidemiology and treatment strategies" by Batsis, JA et al. [20]. In addition to the developmental context, the significant increase in citation counts is also a noteworthy aspect. As shown in Figure 14, the articles with the highest burst intensities in the timeline are the two works by Cruz-Jentoft et al., published in 2010 and 2019, titled "Sarcopenia: European consensus on definition and diagnosis" (41.38) [12] and "Sarcopenia: revised European consensus on definition and diagnosis" (39.63) [43]. On the other hand, the six articles at the bottom of the timeline are still showing bursts, indicating that the topics addressed in these articles are currently popular in research and offer scholars insights into the latest trends and potential research directions.

Discussion

SO is characterized by a concurrent decline in muscle mass and function, coupled with a rise in adipose tissue. This issue is becoming more concerning among elderly individuals because of its significant health consequences, including effects on longevity, associated conditions, and vulnerability to age-related disorders. The complex pathophysiology of SO entails a multifaceted interplay among muscle, fat tissue, hormonal fluctuations, inflammation, oxidative stress, and lifestyle factors [44]. Our study involved the analysis of 985 articles on SO in the Web of Science Core Collection. The literature was analyzed in depth by country/region, institution, journal, author, and keywords. Bibliometrix R software and CiteSpace were utilized to explore the knowledge structure, research hotspots, and emerging trends in this field. The findings aim to provide a foundation for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for this complex condition.

The interest in SO among older adults is growing, with the number of citations in this field increasing each year, reaching 127 in 2022. Among the 79 countries and regions that have conducted research on SO in older individuals, the United States stands out for its high publication output and substantial international collaborations. There has also been a noteworthy rise in the number of publications from South Korea and China, likely influenced by the increasing elderly population in these nations. Three of the top 10 institutions with the most publications on this topic are from both the United States and South Korea. Italy emerges as a key focus of international research, ranking second only to the US in total citation count and link strength. Both countries have shown strong publication outputs and link strength in this area. Additionally, all of the leading 10 journals in terms of publication and citation counts related to SO in older adults fall under the Q2 category or higher, indicating significant interest from both the public and scientific community in this field.

Keywords with close co-occurrence relationships can be categorized into three main clusters. The first cluster delves into the endocrinological and metabolic aspects of SO in older adults, encompassing metabolic syndrome, adipose tissue, fat-free mass, body composition, and insulin resistance. The second cluster revolves around the conceptualization of SO in older adults, covering aspects like definition, consensus, pathophysiology (inflammation), and the clinical significance of SO in older adults, such as its impact on frailty, disability, and mortality. The third cluster primarily addresses risk factors and clinical implications of SO in older adults, specifically focusing on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease.

The pathogenesis of SO is multifaceted, involving aging, a sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary choices, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These factors collectively contribute to the decline in muscle mass and function, alongside an increase in fat mass. Among the top 20 keywords associated with the pathogenesis of SO are aging, insulin resistance, inflammation, and nutrition/malnutrition. The relationship between inflammation and SO has been a prominent subject of research in recent years. Muscle and adipose tissue share common inflammatory pathways, through which peptides are produced in an autocrine and paracrine manner to facilitate intercellular signaling. These pathways are interconnected, contributing to the pathogenesis of SO [45]. The secretion of peptides by adipocytes is closely tied to the size of these cells, with larger adipocytes producing higher levels of pro-inflammatory adipokines and lower levels of anti-inflammatory adipokines. Weight gain can lead to adipocyte enlargement, disrupting the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Additionally, as individuals age, adipocytes tend to exhibit more pro-inflammatory characteristics. Obesity triggers the activation of macrophages, mast cells, and T lymphocytes, resulting in the production of various adipokines and cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins, and interferon-γ. This immune response causes infiltration of immune cells and sets off an inflammatory cascade. These inflammatory factors are not limited to adipose tissue, potentially exacerbating inflammation and oxidative stress. Impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation can increase lipid peroxidation, leading to the accumulation of lipid intermediates and reactive oxygen metabolites. This, in turn, heightens insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, and myocytic lipotoxicity, ultimately contributing to myocyte dysfunction and apoptosis [46]. Muscle biopsies from obese individuals have revealed upregulated expression of chemokine genes that hinder myocyte differentiation and proliferation, providing further evidence for this perspective [47].

Our study identified that the hotspots regarding SO interventions were "nutrition" and "exercise." The key objectives in treating SO are to combine exercise and nutritional interventions with the aim of creating a negative energy balance to reduce adipose tissue (improving adipose markers and reducing inflammatory parameters) while preserving and ideally increasing muscle mass and function [48]. Energy restriction activates cellular stress response elements, improves autophagy, and alters apoptosis and hormone balance. However, caution should be exercised when implementing low-calorie diets for weight loss to prevent compromising muscle mass and strength. Some scholars suggest that an energy restriction of approximately 500 kcal/d (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ) can effectively promote weight loss, is safe, and can counteract the reduction in non-fat mass. A reasonable weight loss target should not exceed 5% to 8% of the initial weight. Moderate weight loss (around 5%) has been shown to reduce muscle fat infiltration and enhance muscle function. Therefore, patients following a low-calorie diet may have increased protein requirements, and protein intake should be carefully managed to preserve fat-free mass and enhance muscle strength. The optimal type and quantity of protein supplements have yet to be determined, but it is recommended to supplement essential amino acids like leucine, arginine, and cysteine. As for the amount of protein supplements, it is advised to consume 1.0~1.2 g·kg-1·d-1, with some scholars suggesting 1.2~1.6 g·kg-1·d-1. In individuals with renal impairment, the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. Evidence suggests that specific nutrients such as beta-hydroxymethylbutyrate, vitamin D, creatine, omega-3 fatty acids, and low calcium levels can enhance protein anabolism, improve muscle mass, increase sensitivity to anabolic signals, and reduce fat accumulation while promoting lipid oxidation. Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise benefits of these nutrients, as well as to identify their optimal combinations and dosages [49].

Exercise has a multitude of beneficial effects on individuals with SO. It can influence hormone balance, reduce oxidative stress, lower inflammatory responses, promote mitochondrial synthesis, alter immune and motor functions, increase muscle oxidative capacity, enhance muscle protein synthesis, and enhance insulin sensitivity. Simply losing weight without including exercise may result in a reduction of fat-free mass, worsening the condition. However, incorporating exercise along with energy restriction can aid in preventing the loss of fat-free mass [50].

The optimal form of exercise for SO patients is yet to be definitively determined. However, current data indicate that a combination of resistance exercise and aerobic exercise may be the most effective. Resistance training has been shown to be more beneficial in combating sarcopenia, while aerobic training is more effective in addressing obesity. A six-month randomized controlled trial involving obese older adults found that the combined exercise group showed greater improvements in physical performance tests and quality of life compared to groups that only engaged in resistance or aerobic exercises. This group also experienced greater strength gains, increased lean mass, and reduced resistance. Although limited, data on alternative forms of exercise such as whole-body electrical stimulation, vibration, yoga, and tai chi suggest that they may also be effective for SO patients, particularly for those with physical disabilities or mobility issues [51,52].

There is currently a lack of studies on interventions for SO in older adults among the top 15 most highly cited references. This is partly due to the fact that the majority of these highly cited references were published before 2018. While it is well established that resistance exercise can improve skeletal muscle function in SO, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends a strength training program to be conducted at least twice a week on non-consecutive days, with one set of eight to 12 repetitions for healthy adults and 10-15 repetitions for older and frail individuals [53]. However, there remains a scarcity of clinical studies focused on a comprehensive intervention tailored specifically to SO in older adults. A meta-analysis of 15 studies on the effects of exercise and nutritional intervention on body composition, metabolic health, and physical performance in adults with SO found that aerobic exercise reduced body weight and fat mass (FM). Resistance exercise (RE) decreased FM and improved grip strength, while the combination of aerobic exercise and RE decreased FM and improved walking speed. Nutritional interventions, particularly low-calorie high-protein (LCHP) diets, reduced FM but did not impact muscle mass and grip strength. Despite exercise training being crucial for improving body composition and physical performance in individuals with SO, nutritional intervention with LCHP only decreased FM without enhancing physical performance [54]. Elderly individuals with SO commonly exhibit a variety of complex conditions and increased heterogeneity, including multiple chronic illnesses and geriatric syndromes. Performing interventional research on this diverse group with SO presents many challenges.

While previous bibliometric analyses have examined SO, there remains a notable gap in research on SO among the elderly population. This study stands out as the first bibliometric analysis focusing on research related to SO specifically in older adults. The findings from this analysis are essential for gaining insights into current research trends, key areas of interest, and potential future research directions concerning SO in the elderly. Our bibliometric analysis underscores that SO among the elderly is a significant research area that encompasses geriatrics, gerontology, endocrine and metabolic diseases, and clinical nutrition. While academic research has shed light on SO, numerous clinical studies have underscored the efficacy of exercise and nutritional interventions in addressing obesity, sarcopenia, and the combination of both in adults. Nevertheless, there remains a dearth of clinical research and evidence-based medicine on effectively managing obese sarcopenia in the elderly. Given the vast heterogeneity and complexity of the elderly population, significant challenges persist in tackling this issue. In clinical settings, it is imperative for healthcare providers to acknowledge the presence and detrimental effects of obese sarcopenia and not overlook it, as doing so could lead to overlooking a critical issue. For elderly individuals dealing with both obesity and sarcopenia, it is recommended to conduct a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). By utilizing the assessment results along with the patient's comorbidities, physical functioning, social support, and life expectancy, a geriatric interdisciplinary team (GIT) can develop personalized interventions to improve the patient's quality of life and overall prognosis.

This investigation has several limitations. While the study heavily relies on the Web of Science Core Collection database for its vast literary resources and reliable information, there is a risk of a potentially incomplete literature search. To improve coverage, it would be beneficial to include additional databases such as PubMed and Scopus. Furthermore, the search strategy limited to the terms "sarcopenic obesity" may have excluded relevant publications, introducing a risk of selection bias. The study exclusively focuses on English-language literature, potentially overlooking valuable non-English-language literature. Additionally, the bibliometric analysis does not assess the quality of the searched literature. Lastly, the study only considers literature published between 2004 and 2023, suggesting that researchers interested in the field should analyze newly published research since 2024.

Conclusions

The analysis indicates a significant increase in global research focusing on SO in older adults, a key area of study spanning geriatrics, gerontology, endocrine and metabolic diseases, and clinical nutrition. The United States leads in this research domain. While academic investigations have illuminated aspects of SO, there is a noticeable lack of clinical research and evidence-based medicine on effectively managing obese sarcopenia in the elderly. With the aging population, there is an urgent need for coordinated efforts to reduce adverse health outcomes associated with geriatric SO. Tailored interventions for older adults with SO should be a priority. Our study can serve as a guide for SO research in older adults, aiding researchers in identifying crucial information and senior experts in expanding collaboration networks or designing future clinical trials.
