The brain is composed of neurons with different structures and functions, and studying the structure and function of these neurons is a significant and challenging frontier hot spot1. Through the continuous exploration of scholars, the neural network has been formed to study brain science based on the structure and function of neurons2. Neural network simulates neuronal activities with mathematical models, which can realize human brain's thinking, perception and other behaviors3. In the past few decades, neural networks have received extensive attention from scholars and have been applied in many fields, such as secure communication4, fault detection5, intelligent control6, machine learning7 and deep learning8. In the general neural network model, the resistors act as biological synapses, but ordinary resistors can not meet the needs of memory, and memristors can achieve this function. The memristor was proposed by Professor Chua9 in 1971 and implemented by Strukov and Snidein10 in 2008. Memristor neural networks are characterized by plastic response, non-volatility, nanoscale size, low energy consumption, storability and easy integration11. In addition, among the many dynamic behaviors of neural networks, tracking and synchronization are very meaningful research content12. Tracking and synchronization mean that related neural network nodes achieve the same dynamic behavior. Pinning synchronization can be divided into pinning synchronization13, sliding mode synchronization14 and exponential synchronization15 and fixed/prescribed-time synchronization16, etc. However, it is often impossible to obtain the exact initial state value of the system in practical application. In order to solve this problem, Cheng and Tang17 proposed the finite-time and fixed-time synchronization of delayed memory neural networks based on adaptive aperiodic intermittent adjustment strategy in 2023. Compared with the uncertainty of infinite rest time in asymptotic and exponential synchronization theory and the initial value dependence of finite rest time in finite time synchronization theory, the certainty and independence of finite and fixed-time synchronization theory have been greatly improved. The practical applications of neural network tracking and synchronization theory, such as tracking control and secure communication, have received extensive attention and in-depth research18–35.

However, for the above works, the controller design is only for a specific chaotic networks and does not have universality. The adaptive control of memristive system based on linear matrix inequalities technique and Chebyshev neural network has rarely been reported.

Based on Lyapunov stability theory, a suitable nonlinear adaptive controller and compensation controller are designed in this paper, and the synchronization problem of a class of memristive systems and neural networks is studied. The main highlights and contributions are summarized as follows: (1) Different from the traditional stability theory, the compensatory controller and adaptive controller used in this paper require fewer parameters, reduce energy consumption, and have better economic mechanism. (2) Adding memristive components that are highly similar to biological synapses to the traditional neural network model can better simulate the human brain. (3) Based on linear matrix inequality technique, a simple controller and a compensatory controller and the update law are designed. (4) A novel synchronization method via Chebyshev neural network is proposed, then, taking this memristve system with external disturbances as an example, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Tracking control method

The memristive system is described as1 x˙=Ax+F(x),

where x∈Rn is the state variable, A∈Rn×n is the coefficient matrix, F(x)∈Rn is the nonlinear function which satisfies the following Lipschitz conditions:2 F(x)-F(x^)≤Lx-x^,

where L>0, x^=[x^1,x^2,…,x^n]T denotes Euclidean norm.

The structure of the proposed adaptive controlled memristive system is shown in Fig. 1. Assuming the reference signal x^=[x^1,x^2,…,x^n]T and a tracking controller U to (1), one has3 x˙=Ax+F(x)+U.

where U=[U1,U2,…,Un]T.Figure 1 The structure of the proposed adaptive controlled system.

In order to realize x to track the reference signal, it needs the next steps.

Applying a compensatory controller u^=[u^1,u^2,…,u^n]T to (1), one obtains4 x^˙=Ax^+F(x^)+u^.

Defining the error ei=x^i-xi, (i=1,2,…,n), let5 u^-U=-u,

where u is the adaptive controller, Subtracting (3) from (4). One has6 e˙=Ae+F(x^)-F(x)-u.

Theorem 1

Under the nonlinear function F(x^)-F(x) of (6) satisfies the Lipschitz condition (2), if the controller and update law are designed, respectively, as7 u=Γe+keΘeΘe,

8 k˙=μΘee.

where q∈R+, μ∈R+, Γ∈Rn×n, Θ∈Rn×n is a positive definite symmetric matrix which satisfies the following linear matrix inequality :9 (A-Γ)TΘ+Θ(A-Γ)T<0,

The error e(t) is globally asymptotically stable to zero under the action of the controller (7) and update law (8).

Proof

Define Lyapunov function as10 V=eTΘe+1μk-L2,

Since Θ is a positive definite matrix, V is also positive definite. One has 11 V˙=e˙TΘe+eTΘe˙+2μk˙k-L=2{eTAT+[F(x^)-F(x)-u]T}Θe+2μk˙k-L=2eTATΘe+2[F(x^)-F(x)]TΘe-2eTΓT+keΘeeTΘTΘe+2(k-L)Θee≤2eTATΘe-2eTΓTΘe+2LΘee-2kΘee+2kΘee-2LΘee=2eTATΘ-ΓTΘe=eT(A-Γ)TΘ+Θ(A-Γ)Te,

One has12 V≤eT[(A-Γ)TΘ+Θ(A-Γ)T]e,

According to (9), one has13 V˙≤0.

Therefore, the error (6) is globally asymptotically stable at zero. The proof is completed.

Remark 1

The linear matrix inequality Eq. (9) holds that all the eigenvalues of the matrix A-Γ are negative. And the controller u is derived by selecting a matrix such that all eigenvalues of the matrix A-Γ are negative, and a positive definite symmetric matrix Λ is arbitrarily defined. The positive definite symmetric matrix Θ can be obtained, so that the adaptive controller u can be determined by (7). The expression of the compensatory controller u^ can be easily determined by substituting the reference signal into the system.

Synchronization control via Chebyshev neural network

The driven system is described as14 x˙(t)=[A+ΔA(t)]x+f(x)+Δf(x,t)+dm(t),

The corresponding response system is given as15 y˙(t)=[B+ΔB(t)]y+g(y)+Δg(y,t)+ds(t)+u(t),

where x=[x1,x2,⋯,xn]T, y=[y1,y2,⋯,yn]T. A and B are constant matrice, ΔA and ΔB are the perturbations, f and g are nonlinear functions, Δf and Δg are uncertainties, dm(t) and ds(t) are external disturbances and the synchronization error e=y-x. One has16 e˙=By-Ax+ΔB(t)y-ΔA(t)x+g(y)-f(x)+Δg(y,t)-Δf(x,t)+ds(t)-dm(t)+u(t).

The structure of Chebyshev neural network is depicted as Fig. 2.Figure 2 The structure of Chebyshev neural network.

Lemma 1

If limt→∞ξ(t)→Θ and ξ˙(t) is bounded, then, limt→∞ξ(t)→0.

Theorem 2

Considering the interval [-1,1], Chebyshev polynomials, which are given as17 Ti+1(x)=2xTi(x)-Ti-1(x),i=1.2.…,m-1.

and the function ϕ(x) of Chebyshev neural network is considered as18 ϕLP(x)=∑i=1mwiTi(x)=WTT,

where W=[w0,w1,…,wm]T, T=[T0,T1,…,Tm]T.

And ϕ(x) can be written as19 ϕ(x)=WTT+ε,

The controller can be designed as20 u=-σE-f^-ur.

The compensatory controller is designed as21 ur=λsgn(ETΘM),

where σ>0 is the matrix of feedback gains, Θ is a symmetric positive definite matrix as (9). λ is a constant.M=I,f^=Tη^ is the uncertain estimator using Chebyshev neural network, suppose that the first five polynomials are chosen as follow:22 T=T00000T00000T00000T0,

where T0=[1,T1,T2,T3,T4],η^=[η^1T,η^2T,η^3T,η^4T], η^i=[w0i,w1i,w2i,w3i,w4i]T, and23 T1=x,T2=2x2-1,T3=4x3-3x,T4=8x4-8x2+1.

w0i, w1i, …,w4i denote the coefficients of Chebyshev neural network to be estimated.

Then, the synchronization between (14) and (15) can be achieved.

Proof

Define Lyapunov function as24 V=12ETΘE+12γη¯Tη¯,

where Θ is a symmetric positive definite matrix as (9). η¯=η∗-η^,γ is a positive constant. The time derivative of V is25 V˙=-12(E˙TΘE+ETΘE˙)-1γη¯Tη^˙,

One has26 V˙=-12ETΓE+η¯TϕTMTΘE+ETΘM(ϑ-ur)-1γη¯Tη^˙,

where ϑ(t)≤λ, let27 η^˙=γϕTMTΘE,

Then, Eq. (26) can be rewritten as28 V˙=-12ETΓE+ETΘM[ϑ(t)-ur],

If one assumes the compensatory controller ur satisfies29 ETΘM[ϑ(t)-ur]≤0,

Substituting (21) into (29), one has30 ETΘϑ(t)-ETΘλsgn(ETΘ)≤0,

One has31 ETΘMϑ(t)-λETΘM≤0,

One has32 ETΘMϑ(t)-λ≤0,

According to Lemma 1, assuming that ϑ(t)≤λ, one may get33 V˙≤0.

Therefore, Theorem 2 is completely proved.

Model of memristive system

A memristive system is described as:34 x˙=ax+by+yzy˙=-xz+yz-cF(y,ω)z˙=-z-dxy+eω˙=y,

where35 F=(1+0.25z2-0.0002z4)y,

when a=0.5, b=3, c=0.1, d=6, e=1, initial conditions x(0)=-1, y(0)=-1.5, z(0)=-0.1,ω(0)=-0.5, the phase diagram of system (34) are plotted in Fig. 3.Figure 3 The projection phase of memristive system (34), (a) x,y, (b) x,z, (c) y,z, (d) x,y,z.

Results and discussion

Taking the memristive system (34) as an example, rewrite it as36 x˙1x˙2x˙3x˙4=0.53000-0.10000-100100x1x2x3x4+x2x3-x1x3+x2x3-0.025x2x42+0.0002x2x44-6x1x20,

I. The tracking control of fixed-point P(c1,c2,c3,c4).

Assume the reference signal x^=[1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4], according to (6), the compensatory controller can be obtained as37 u^1=-12.5u^2=-2.2048u^3=14u^4=-2,

Let Γ=Diag10,0,0,10, one has38 A=0.53000-0.10000-100100,A-Γ=-9.53000-0.10000-10010-10,

The eigenvalues of the matrix A-Γ can be obtained as follow39 λ1=-9.50,λ2=-10.0,λ3=-0.10,λ4=-1.0,

It can be seen that all the eigenvalues are negative, and the positive real symmetric matrix Λ= Diag (5,5,5,5) is used, according to linear matrix inequality (12), a positive symmetric matrix can be gotten as40 Θ=2.73037.812500.78147.812525.000002.4752002.500000.78142.475200.4975,

According to Eqs. (7), (8) and (9), when x^1(0),x^2(0),x^3(0),x^4(0)=[-1,1.5,-0.1,-0.5], k(0)=2, μ=2, the time domain response and the adaptive parameter k(t) for the controlled mem-system (5) are drawn in Fig. 4.Figure 4 The tracking control of fixed-point P. (a) Time domain response, (b) the parameter k(t).

II. The tracking control of periodic signal

Assume the reference signal r=[sint,cost,2sint,2cost]T, under the action of the compensatory controller, tracking controller, the update law and linear matrix inequality, the initial conditions of the controlled system are chosen as x^1(0),x^2(0),x^3(0),x^4(0)=[-1,1.5,-0.1,-0.5], and μ=2, k(0)=20, the time domain response and the adaptive parameter k(t) for the controlled system (36) are presented in Fig. 5.Figure 5 The tracking control of periodic signal, (a) time domain response, (b) the parameter k(t).

From Figs. 4 and 5, they can be observed that by using linear matrix inequality technique, the compensatory controller and tracking controller and update law can be designed, as time increases, all state variables of the controlled mem-system (5) can quickly track a fixed point and some periodic signals, and the adaptive update law k(t) reaches a stable state.

III. The synchronization control via Chebyshev network

Consider the identical driven and response system described in Eqs. (14) and (15) with the proposed memristive system (36) with external disturbances as an example, initial conditions: x(0)=[1,1,1,1]T and y(0)=[-1,-1,-1,-1]T,dm1=0.1cos(t), dm2=0.1sin(t), dm3=0.1cos(t),dm4=0.1sin(t), ds1=0.1sin(2t), w0i(0)=w1i(0)=w2i(0)=w3i(0)=w4i(0)=1,ds2=0.1cos(2t), ds3=0.1sin(2t), ds4=0.1cos(2t), λ=5,γ=0.1σi=5, the unique input of Chebyshev neural network x=sin(2πt),the synchronization are illustrated in Fig. 6, it is clearly seen that the proposed controller is faster in reducing the time of synchronization errors. Moreover, the controller design is simpler. Chebyshev neural network can be used to approximate the uncertain nonlinear function and the adaptive law can be used to adjust its correspo- nding parameters in the system.Figure 6 Synchronization control error e(t).

Conclusion

To sum up, a memristive system and the basic principle of tracking control method were introduced, and the stability theory about the tracking control was analyzed. The process was to track the signal with the chaotic variable information driven by the memristive system. Additionally, a synchronization method via Chebyshev neural network was proposed. Compared to previous control schemes, in this scheme, it has the following achievements: (1) The adaptive control methods of memristive system based on linear matrix inequality and Chebyshev neural network are firstly proposed. (2) It has wide control range. This scheme can stabilize the memristive system at arbitrary fixed points or any periodic orbit (see Figs. 4 and 5), the synchronization of two identical mem-systems with external disturbances can be fast achieved (see Fig. 6). The control process is simple and effective. Moreover, the structure of Chebyshev neural networks is simpler since there are fewer tuning parameters. it is particularly easy to implement in engineering. The fractional-order control method and their application in communication will be discussed in next work.
