We present a genome assembly from an individual male Hedya salicella (the White-backed Marble; Arthropoda; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Tortricidae). The genome sequence is 742.3 megabases in span. Most of the assembly is scaffolded into 25 chromosomal pseudomolecules, including the Z sex chromosome. The mitochondrial genome has also been assembled and is 16.3 kilobases in length. Gene annotation of this assembly on Ensembl identified 11,961 protein coding genes.

Background

The White-backed Marble, Heyda salicella (Linnaeus, 1758) is a single brooded, common species of micro moth widely distributed across Europe and introduced in North America ( Gilligan et al., 2020). This large and distinctive Heyda species is predominantly white with a mottled chestnut and grey thorax. It has a wingspan of 19–24 mm and has been recorded in flight from the months June through to September. H. salicella inhabits areas where food plants are abundant, with sightings recorded in marshy areas amongst willows, banks of streams, open woodland and occasionally parks and gardens. Larvae feed on spun shoots and folded leaves of Salix (willow, sallow) and Populus (poplar, aspen) species ( Kimber, 2023).

The genome of H. salicella was sequenced as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project, a collaborative effort to sequence all named eukaryotic species in the Atlantic Archipelago of Britain and Ireland. Here we present a complete chromosome-level genome sequence for H. salicella, based on one male specimen from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK. This high-quality complete genome assembly of H. salicella, among a phylogenetically diverse set of insect orders, will yield genomes from closely related species, permitting valuable insights into genomic change over shorter time frames ( Mulhair & Holland, 2022), while resolving the biogeographic origin of morphologically similar populations in Europe and North America.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one male Hedya salicella ( Figure 1) collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (latitude 51.77, longitude –1.34). A total of 25-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads and 43-fold coverage in 10X Genomics read clouds were generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected four missing joins or mis-joins and removed one haplotypic duplication, reducing the scaffold number by 16.67%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Hedya salicella (ilHedSali1) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 742.3 Mb in 45 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 27.3 Mb ( Table 1). Most (99.88%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 25 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 24 autosomes and the Z sex chromosome. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 2– Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Genome annotation report

The ilHedSali1.2, GCA_905404275.2 genome assembly was annotated using the Ensembl rapid annotation pipeline ( Table 1; https://rapid.ensembl.org/Hedya_salicella_GCA_905404275.2/Info/Index). The resulting annotation includes 20,143 transcribed mRNAs from 11,961 protein-coding and 1,706 non-coding genes.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

A male Hedya salicella (specimen no. Ox000472, individual ilHedSali1) was collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire (biological vice-county: Berkshire), UK (latitude 51.77, longitude –1.34) on 13 June 2020. The specimen was taken from woodland by Douglas Boyes (University of Oxford) using a light trap. The specimen was identified by the collector, and preserved on dry ice.

DNA was extracted at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The ilHedSali1 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice with tissue set aside for Hi-C sequencing. Whole organism tissue was disrupted using a Nippi Powermasher fitted with a BioMasher pestle. High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted using the Qiagen MagAttract HMW DNA extraction kit. Low molecular weight DNA was removed from a 20 ng aliquot of extracted DNA using the 0.8X AMpure XP purification kit prior to 10X Chromium sequencing; a minimum of 50 ng DNA was submitted for 10X sequencing. HMW DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30. Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation using AMPure PB beads with a 1.8X ratio of beads to sample to remove the shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA sample. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus and 10X Genomics read cloud DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and HiSeq X Ten (10X) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from tissue of ilHedSali1 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the HiSeq X Ten instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). One round of polishing was performed by aligning 10X Genomics read data to the assembly with Long Ranger ALIGN, calling variants with FreeBayes ( Garrison & Marth, 2012). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using SALSA2 ( Ghurye et al., 2019). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected using the gEVAL system ( Chow et al., 2016) as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using gEVAL, HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2022), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

Genome annotation

The Ensembl gene annotation system ( Aken et al., 2016) was used to generate annotation for the Hedya salicella assembly (ilHedSali1.2, GCA_905404275.2). Annotation was created primarily through alignment of transcriptomic data to the genome, with gap filling via protein-to-genome alignments of a select set of proteins from UniProt ( UniProt Consortium, 2019).

The study describes the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the genome of Hedya salicella, a moth found throughout Europe and introduced in North America.

The authors employed HiFi long-read and HI-C approaches to assemble a chromosome-level genome, along with sequencing the mitochondrial genome. However, I noticed the absence of BUSCO completeness results for protein-coding genes. Additionally, there was a lack of description on how the transcriptome data (used in genome annotation) were generated.

The authors did not present analyses of repetitive elements. They mention the number of non-coding RNAs (1,706) but do not specify which types were found or how this was determined in the methods section.

In the "Genome sequence report" section, the first sentence, "The genome was sequenced from one male Hedya salicella…," has already been mentioned at the end of the Background section. I suggest rewriting this sentence.

The study has significant merit for indexing, but I recommend some minor revisions to further improve the quality of the work.

The manuscript entitled “ The genome sequence of the White-backed Marble, Hedya salicella (Linnaeus, 1758)”, by Boyes and colleagues, presents the basic data for the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the  White-backed Marble moth.

The manuscript presents the genome assembly, with ~740Mb span, reporting on basic statistics on genome and annotation quality. The genome was sequenced following up-to-date protocols, focusing on long-read data (PacBio) to attain complete chromosomes. Although the authors do not provide a comparison of genome and annotation quality with other insect genomes, BUSCOs numbers suggest that the assembly have a good quality (completeness ~98%). 

Most of the genome statistics is presented in a Snailplot figure, which I find a poor-choice given it is very confusing, specially to readers not used to genomic data. However, the results are well described and easy to follow.

The manuscript also reports the annotation of 11,961 protein-coding and 1,706 non-coding genes. However, it is not clear if the annotation is of good quality. For such, I recommend the authors to perform a BUSCO analysis on the annotated genes.

The authors present a chromosome-level assembly for the moth species Hedya salicella. They used PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing and Illumina 10X Genomic reads sequencing to perform the initial assembly. For chromosomal-level scaffolding, they used Hi-C data. In this report, the authors show the quality data of this genome as well as an annotation of the gene models.

The sequencing techniques used are appropriate as demonstrated by the high contiguity of the scaffolds. Therefore, the data presented here represents a high-quality genome that has great potential to answer questions related to genome evolution, molecular systematics, population genomics and conservation of Lepidoptera.

However, I found some points that I would like to clarify: Separate “ H. salicella, based.”

The use of “complete” when describing the contiguity of the genome (“This high-quality complete genome assembly of H. salicella”) is not accurate. I agree that is a highly contiguous genome but the assembly still has gaps. Please, delete the word “complete”.

It would be also interesting to report the number of gaps across the final genome assembly.

It is claimed in the manuscript that the assembly is not fully phased. It would be necessary a clearer explanation of this point in the text.

I am unclear about the idea behind these sentences: “This high-quality complete genome assembly of H. salicella, among a phylogenetically diverse set of insect orders, will yield genomes from closely related species, permitting valuable insights into genomic change over shorter time frames.” Suppose the intention was to point out that this genome can help assemble other genomes of closely related species. In that case, I think it is debatable, considering that closely related species within the same family seem to have some degree of variation in the number of chromosomes (see Table 1 in Traut, Sahara, and Marec, 2008). If the intention was to point out that its comparison with closely related species is of interest for genomic analysis, etc., then, I think it might be necessary to rephrase the sentence. The sentence could be rephrased as: This high-quality genome for the species H. salicella constitutes a valuable resource for studying genomic evolution over short periods among closely related species.

The use of the term sequencing depth instead of coverage could be more appropriate when the authors refer to it in the text. Both terms are interchangeable, but I think in this case it refers to the sense of sequencing depth, and therefore it would be more precise (Sims, et al, 2014 [Ref-2]).

It is mentioned that transcriptomic information was used for genome annotation, but whether these transcriptomes were sequenced from the same individual or from other individuals is not specified. It is also not specified which tissue was used to sequence the transcriptomes. I believe this section needs further clarification.

The genome's BUSCO score is reported, but not the BUSCO of the annotation. It would be interesting to know this value for the annotation.

As described in the article, the genome annotation was performed following the Ensembl gene annotation system. Like most current genome annotations, this method requires the annotation of repetitive elements in the genome. Information on repeats such as microsatellites or transposons is highly relevant since it often constitutes a large amount of genomic material in the species, with direct implications during development or evolution. If possible, I think it would be very informative if this report provides information on the annotation of repetitive elements such as the percentage of total elements found and the most frequent transposon families. Although the suggested addition could be out of the scope of this data note, this information is commonly reported in genome analyses. In the case of this H. salicella, it might be of great interest considering the disproportionate size of the Z chromosome, which is five times larger than the average of the other pseudochromosomes.
