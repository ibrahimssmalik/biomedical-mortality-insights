The theory of symmetric matrices as well as range symmetric matrices are well known in literature. A matrix is said to be EP (or range symmetric), whenver the range space of the matrix is equal to the range space of its conjugate transpose. In other words, matrix is EP whenever its null space is same as that of the null space of its conjugate transpose. Ballantine 1 has studied about the product of two EP matrices of specific rank to be again an EP matrix. In 2 new characterizations of EP matrices are given. Also, weighted EP matrix is defined and characterized. Meenakshi 3 extended the concept of range symmetric matrices over Minkowski space. In 2014, the same author defined range symmetric matrices in indefinite inner product space. 4

For an n×n matrix A , the secondary transpose is related to transpose of the matrix by the relation AS=VATV . Here, the matrix V has non zero unitary entries only on the secondary diagonal. For a matrix A with complex entries, the secondary transpose will be renamed as secondary conjugate transpose Aθ and is given by Aθ=VA∗V . Definition 1 (Ref. 5) Let A∈ℝn×n . Then the secondary transpose (or secondary conjugate transpose Aθ in the case of complex matrices) of A denoted by AS and is defined as AS=bij , where bij=an−j+1,n−i+1 , i,j=1,2,…n .

Throughout this article we assume V to be a permutation matrix with units in the secondary diagonal. Also, NA represents the null space of the matrix A . The column space and rank of A are denoted by CA,ρA respectively. The set of matrices of order n×n over the field of real numbers is denoted by ℝn×n .

The concept of secondary conjugate transpose is gaining importance in recent years. Shenoy 6 has defined Outer Theta inverse by combining the outer inverse and secondary transpose of a matrix A . Drazin-Theta matix AD,θ 7 is a new class of generalized inverse introduced for a square matrix of index m. One can refer 8 for the extension of these inverses over rectangular matrices. R. Vijayakumar 9 introduced the concept of secondary generalized inverse with the help of secondary transpose of a matrix. This concept is similar to Moore Penrose inverse. But unlike Moore penrose inverse, existence of s-g inverse is not assured in general. In Ref. 10, a necessary and sufficient conditions of existence of s-g invese is given. In the same article, a few characterizations and a determinantal formula for s-g inverse also has been discussed. In 2009, Krishnamoorthy and Vijayakumar 11 has defined the concept of s-normal matrices with the help of secondary transopse for a class of complex square matrices. Jayashree 12 has defined secondary k-range symmetric fuzzy matrices. Its relation with s-range symmetric fuzzy matrices, k-range fuzzy symmetric matrices and EP matrices are defined.

In this article, we define secondary range symmetric matrices. Several equivalent conditions for a matrix to be secondary range symmetric, is obtained here. Also, the existence of secondary generalized inverse of a secondary range symmetric matrix is discussed.

Below are some useful deifnitions and results related to secondary conjugate transpose. Definition 2 (Ref. 13) Let A∈ℂn×n . Then the conjugate secondary transpose of A denoted by Aθ and is defined as Aθ=A¯s=cij where cij=a¯n−j+1,n−i+1 .

Definition 3 (Ref. 13) A matrix is said to be secondary normal (s-normal) if AAS=ASA .

Definition 4 (Ref. 10) A†S is said to be secondary generalized inverse of A if AA†SA=AA†SAA†S=A†S

and AA†S and A†SA are S - symmetric.

Theorem 0.1 (Ref. 10) Given an m×n matrix A . The following statements are equivalent. (i) A has s-cancellation property (i.e., AsAX=0AX=0 and YAAs=0YA=0 ).

(ii) ρAsA=ρAAs=ρA

(iii) As exists.

Definition 5 (Ref. 14) A matrix A∈ℂn×n is said to be EP (or range symmetric) if NA=NA∗ .

Meenakshi 3 has defined EP in Minkowski space and has given equivalent conditions for a matrix to be range symmetric. Definition 6 (Ref. 3) A matrix A∈ℂn×n is said to be range symmetric in Minkowski space if and only if NA=NA+ .

Here A+ represents the Minkowski adjoint given by A+=GA∗G where G is the Minkowski metric tensor.

Results

In this section, we define secondary range symmetric matrices which is analogous to that of range symmetric matrices. Some equivalent conditions for a matrix to be range symmetric is also given here. Definition 7 X is secondary right (left) normalized g inverse of A if AXA=A , XAX=X and AX is S -symmetric. ( XA is S -symmetric).

Definition 8 Consider A∈ℝm×n . The s-transpose of A is defined as As=bij where bij=am−j+1,n−i+1 , 1≤i≤n,1≤j≤m .

Definition 9 A matrix A∈ℝn×n secondary range symmetric if and only if NA=NAS

Theorem 0.2 Let A∈ℝn×n . Then the following conditions are equivalent. (i) A is secondary range symmetric

(ii) VA is EP

(iii) AV is EP

(iv) NA∗=NAV

(v) CA=CAS

(vi) AS=BA=AC where B and C are some nonsingular matrices

(vii) CA∗=CVA

(viii) CA∗⊕NA=ℂn

(ix) CA⊕NA∗=ℂn

Proof 1 A is secondary range symmetric⇔NA=NAS⇔NVA=NASV⇔VA is EP⇔VVAVSis EP⇔AV is EP.

Hence 1⇔2⇔3 holds true.

1⇔4 A is secondary range symmetric⇔NA=NAS⇔NA=NVA∗V⇔NA=NA∗V⇔A∗V=A∗VA1A⇔A∗=A∗VA1AV⇔A∗=A∗AV1AV⇔NA∗=NAV

This proves the equivalence of 1 and 4 .

3⇔5 AV is range symmetric⇔CAV=CAV∗⇔CA=CVA∗⇔CA=CVA∗V⇔CA=CAS

Hence 3 and 5 are equivalent.

2⇔6 VAis range symmetric⇔VA∗=VAPfor some nonsingularn×nmatrixP⇔A∗V=VAP⇔VA∗V=AP⇔AS=AP⇔A=APS=PSAS⇔AS=PS−1A⇔AS=KAwhereK=PS−1.

Hence 2⇔6 .

5⇔7 CA=CAS⇔CA=CVASV⇔CA=CVAS⇔VA∗=AA1VA∗⇔A∗=VAA1VA∗⇔A∗=VAVA1A∗⇔CA∗=CVA

Thus equivalence of 5 and 7 are proved.

2 ⇔ 8 . VA is range symmetric⇔ℂn=CVA⊕NGA=CVA∗⊕NA=CA∗V⊕NA=CA∗⊕NA

Thus equivalence of 2 and 8 are proved.

3⇔9 AV is range symmetric⇔ℂn=CAV⊕NAV=ℂn=CAV⊕NAV∗=CA⊕NA∗

Thus the equivalence of 3 and 9 is proved.

From the following example, it is clear that EP matrices in Minkowski space defined by Meenakshi 3 and secondary range symmetric matrices are two different concepts.

Consider a matrix A=−111−1 where AS=−111−1 . Here, A is secondary normal as well as ρA=ρAAS . The matrix A is secondary range symmetric. However, the matrix is not range symmetric in Minkowski’s space since A+=GA∗G=−1−1−1−1 . It is clear that NA≠NA+ .

Let B=1−11−1 and BS=−1−111 . Clearly B is not secondary range symmetric.

Observe that B is range symmetric in Minkowski space. Since, B+=GB∗G=1−11−1 so that NB=NB+ .

Note that AS=VA∗V=VGA+GV .

A necessary condition for a matrix to be a s-EP (secondary range symmetric) is proved here. Theorem 0.3 Let A∈ℝn×n . If A is secondary normal and ρA=ρAAS , then A is secondary range symmetric.

Proof 2 Since A is secondary normal, AAS=ASA . Hence ρA=ρAAS=ρASA=ρAS which implies NA=NAAS=NASA=NAS . Thus A is secondary range symmetric.

A relation connecting range symmetric and secondary range symmetric matrices is given below: Theorem 0.4 Let A∈ℝn×n . Then any two of the following conditions imply the third one. (1) A is EP.

(2) A is secondary EP.

(3) CA=CVA .

Proof 3 1,2⇒3

Since A is EP, CA=CA∗ . By Theorem 0.2 , CA∗=CVA as A is secondary range symmetric. Hence A is secondary EP ⇔ CA=CVA .

2,3⇒1

Since A is s-EP, by Theorem 0.2 , VA is range symmetric. Hence CVA=CVA∗=CA∗V=CA∗ . Also, By (3), CA=CVA from which it follows that CA=CA∗ . Hence A is range symmetric. Thus (1) holds.

For any square complex matrix A , there exists unique S - symmetric matrices such that A=M+iN where M=12A+AS and N=12iA−AS . In the following theorem, an equivalent condition for a matrix A to be secondary range symmetric is obtained interms of M , the S -symmetric part of A . Theorem 0.5 For A∈ℝn×n , A is secondary range symmetric if and only if NA⊆NM where M is the S -symmetric part of A .

Proof 4 If A is secondary range symmetric, then NA=NAS . For x∈NA , Ax=0 and ASx=0 . Hence Mx=0 . Thus, NA⊆NM , then Ax=0⇒Mx=0 and hence Nx=0 . Therefore NA⊆NN . Thus NA⊆NM∩NN . Since, both M and N are S -symmetric, they are secondary range symmetric. NM=NMS=NVM∗V=NM∗V

and NN=NNS=NVN∗V=NN∗V

Now, NA⊆NM∩NN=NM∗V∩NN∗V⊆NM∗+iN∗V=NA∗V and ρA=ρA∗=ρA∗V . Therefore, NA=NA∗V=NVA∗V=NAS . Thus A is secondary range symmetric.

We shall discuss the existence of secondary generalized inverse inverse of a secondary range symmetric matrix. First, we shall prove certain lemmas, to simplify the proof of the main result. Lemma 1 For an m×n matrix A , if A†S exists, then CA†S=CAS .

Proof 5 If A†S exists, then A†SA=A†SAS=ASAA†SSA†SS and A†S=A†SAA†S=ASA†SSA†S⇒CA†S⊆CAS.

Further, ρA†S=ρA=ρAS . Thus, CA†S=CAS .

Lemma 2 For an m×n matrix A , if A†S exists, then CAA†S is the projection on CA†S and A†SA is the projection on CA†S .

Proof 6 x∈CA if and only if x=Ay=AA†SAy=AA†Sx . By definition 2 , AA†S being S -symmetric, idempotent is the projection on CA . Similarly, x∈CA†S if and only if x=A†SAA†Sy=A†SAx and A†SA is S -symmetric and idempotent. Hence A†SA is the projection on CA†S .

Theorem 0.6 For an n×n matrix A , the following are equivalent: (1) A is secondary range symmetric and ρA=ρA2.

(2) A†S exists and A†S is secondary range symmetric.

(3) There exists a symmetric idempotent matrix E such that AE=EA and CA=CE.

Proof 7 1⇒2 . Since ρA=ρA2 and A is secondary symmetric, by using Theorem 0.2 we have, ρASA=ρBA2=ρA2=ρA and ρAAS=ρA2C=ρA2=ρA . Thus ρA=ρAAS=ρASA . Hence by Thoerem 0.1 , it follows that A†S exists, By Lemma 1 and Theorem 0.2 , CA†S=CAS=CA=CASS=CA†SS . Hence A†S is range symmetric. Thus (2) holds.

2⇒3 . Since A†S exists, by Lemma 1, CA†S=CAS , by Theorem 0.2, A†S is secondary range symmetric which implies that CA†S=CA†SS . Hence CAS=CA†SS . By Lemma 2, it follows that ASAS†S=A†SSAS , hence A†SAS=AA†SS . By definition 2, A†SA=AA†S=E , is S - symmetric, idempotent and AE=EA=A ; hence CA⊆CE and ρE=ρAA†S=ρA , which implies CA=CE . Thus 3 holds.

3⇒1 . Since, E is S - symmetric and idempotent, ES=E=E2 , by lemma 1.1, E†S exists and E†S=E implies E is the projection on CA . For all reflexive g-inverses Ar of A , AAr=EE†S=E . Since E is S - symmetric and idempotent, AAr is S - symmetric. Hence by definition 7, An exists and AAn=EE†S=E which implies EA=A . By hypothesis AE=EA=A . Therefore AAn=AnA=E . Thus both AAn and AnA are S - symmetric. By definition 2, A†S exists and E=AA†S=A†SA . By taking secondary transpose on AE=EA=A , we get EAS=ASE=AS . CAS⊆CE=CA and ρAS=ρA . Therefore CA=CAS . By theorem 0.2, A is secondary ramge symmetric. ρAAS≥ρAASA†SS=ρAA†SS , ρAE=ρA≥ρAAS . Thus ρA=ρAAS=ρA2C=ρA2 . Thus (1) holds. Hence the theorem.

Corollary 1 Consider an n×n secondary range symmetric matrix A . Then A†S exists if and only if ρA=ρA2 .

Proof 8 Since A is secondary range symmetric and ρA=ρA2 , the existence of A†S follows from Thereom 0.6. Conversly, if A is secondary range symmetric, and A†S exists, then by Theorem 0.1 ρA=ρAAS=ρASA and by Theorem 0.2 , AS=AC . Hence ρA=ρAAC=ρA2 .

Conclusion

As an extension of this work, one can think of defining weighted secondary EP matrices and its characteriations. Also, extending secodary range symmetric matrix to indefinite inner prodcut spaces will open up a new area of research.

I am very delighted to see the scholarly interest in the study of range symmetric matrices. Here are my suggestions for improving the article: Some definitions (such as definition 1) are not clearly written and need to be clarified for better understanding.

The article requires a sufficient number of illustrations to explain the theory and definitions, which are currently missing.

A new preliminary section should be included, containing all the necessary basic concepts to provide a strong foundation for the reader.

Definition 7 does not adequately explain the entries of matrix A and needs to be revised for clarity.

Definitions 7 and 8 should be illustrated through examples to enhance comprehension.

The proofs, especially the proof of Theorem 1, are not written in an easily understandable manner and should be simplified for better readability.

A conclusion and discussion section must be included and well explained to summarize the findings and implications of the study.

The definition of Minkowski’s space should be included, accompanied by examples to illustrate its application.

The examples given at the beginning of page 5 are not properly explained and need to be elaborated for clarity.

By addressing these points, the article can be significantly improved and provide a clearer, more comprehensive understanding of range symmetric matrices.
