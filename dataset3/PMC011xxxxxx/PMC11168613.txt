Background

The impact of closed-loop control systems to titrate oxygen flow in critically ill patients, including their effectiveness, efficacy, workload and safety, remains unclear. This systematic review investigated the utilization of closed-loop oxygen systems for critically ill patients in comparison to manual oxygen titration systems focusing on these topics.

Methods and findings

A search was conducted across several databases including MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, LOVE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization on March 3, 2022, with subsequent updates made on June 27, 2023. Evidence databases were searched for randomized clinical parallel or crossover studies investigating closed-loop oxygen control systems for critically ill patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis guidelines. The analysis was conducted using Review Manager software, adopting the mean difference or standardized mean difference with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for continuous variables or risk ratio with 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. The main outcome of interest was the percentage of time spent in the peripheral arterial oxygen saturation target. Secondary outcomes included time for supplemental oxygen weaning, length of stay, mortality, costs, adverse events, and workload of healthcare professional. A total of 37 records from 21 studies were included in this review with a total of 1,577 participants. Compared with manual oxygen titration, closed-loop oxygen control systems increased the percentage of time in the prescribed SpO2 target, mean difference (MD) 25.47; 95% CI 19.7, 30.0], with moderate certainty of evidence. Current evidence also shows that closed-loop oxygen control systems have the potential to reduce the percentage of time with hypoxemia (MD -0.98; 95% CI -1.68, -0.27) and healthcare workload (MD -4.94; 95% CI -7.28, -2.61) with low certainty of evidence.

Conclusion

Closed-loop oxygen control systems increase the percentage of time in the preferred SpO2 targets and may reduce healthcare workload.

pmcIntroduction

Critically ill patients frequently require supplemental oxygen due to the clinical manifestation of inadequate gas exchange [1,2]. Oxygen administration can be considered a lifesaving treatment and may reduce the mortality and morbidity of hypoxemic patients [3,4]. Oxygen is commonly utilized for critically ill patients and its prescription is frequently observed for patients undergoing respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation to correct or prevent hypoxemia [3,5,6].

Hypoxemia can result from many factors, such as lung and cardiovascular diseases, or reduced oxygen levels at high altitudes and can potentially progress to hypoxia, leading to potential organ damage [7–10]. In addition, hyperoxemia, the presence of excess oxygen, also carries risks, including oxidative stress and potential harm to vital organs [11–14]. Thus, finding the right balance is crucial [15–20]. Therefore, healthcare professionals must carefully titrate oxygen to ensure that they are adequate for the patient’s needs, minimizing the risks associated with both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia while optimizing patient outcomes.

The literature suggests safe and acceptable targets of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging between 92–98% for patients without lung diseases and 88–92% for patients with previous lung diseases [21]. However, manual adjustment of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to precisely deliver oxygen within the target is both challenging and time-consuming for healthcare professionals [22–24]. Therefore, the adoption of automated technologies may be considered to partially reduce workload of healthcare professionals.

Closed-loop oxygen control systems have been developed to provide continuing monitoring and adjustments of oxygen titration based on patients’ SpO2, avoiding and treating hypoxemia and hyperoxemia episodes [23,24]. These systems are based on the feedback principle to maintain a target saturation prescribed by continuing titrating oxygen levels [22–24]. It remains uncertain whether closed-loop oxygen control systems are effective, efficient, and safe. It is also uncertain whether these systems affect the workload of healthcare providers. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on these topics.

Methods

This review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines [25,26]. This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO [CRD42022306033], and additional details are available in the published protocol [27].

Search strategy

The search was performed on March 3, 2022, and updated on June 27, 2023, in the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and LOVE evidence databases (S1–S6 Tables in S1 File). Furthermore, a search was performed at the ClinicalTrials.gov website and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to find ‘ongoing’ and ‘unpublished’ studies. There were no restrictions to language, date, or type of publication.

Eligibility criteria

The eligibility criteria [28] were (P) population: adult ICU patients requiring supplemental oxygen; (I) intervention: any system or device that allows an automatic oxygen titration, including for use with invasive or noninvasive ventilation or with low- or high-flow oxygen therapy; (C) comparator: manual adjustments of oxygen; and (O) outcome: percentage of time in the SpO2 target, time for weaning from oxygen, length of stay, mortality, costs, adverse events, and workload of healthcare professionals. Different records identified by the same registration number were grouped and considered as a single study. This way, we guarantee that studies with multiple publications were included just once.

Study selection

Two investigators (C.G.M. and A.G.V.) independently screened the studies retrieved by the searches. A third investigator (R.K.N.) was consulted to resolve potential disagreements, if necessary.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was the time in the SpO2 target, defined as the percentage of time in which the SpO2 values remained in the predefined range (e.g., 92 to 96% or 88 to 92%). Secondary outcomes included time for weaning from supplemental oxygen, defined as the total time spent in oxygen support during hospitalization, length of stay, mortality, costs, adverse events, and workload of healthcare professionals, defined as the need for the professional to provide oxygen adjustments (e.g., number of manual adjustments; time spent providing adjustments).

Assessment of characteristics of studies

Characteristics and outcome data from the included studies were independently extracted by two investigators (C.G.M. and A.G.S.) and revised by a third investigator (A.C.P.) using a predefined data collection form.

Risk of bias

The risk of bias for the outcomes was determined by using the ‘Cochrane Risk of Bias 2’ (RoB2) tool for randomized and crossover trials [29,30]. The risk of bias arising from the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome and selection of the reported result were assessed. For crossover studies the risk of bias arising from period and carry-over effects was also assessed.

Data synthesis and analysis

The mean difference or standardized mean difference was adopted to analyze continuous variables, with a 95% confidence interval [95% CI]. Dichotomous outcomes are presented as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. When possible, skewed data were adjusted for mean and standard deviation using Wan’s methods and the RevMan Calculator [31]. For figures with good resolution, we extracted data using the ‘Webplotdigitizer’ website. For crossover studies, the first period was used to perform the analysis to avoid carry-over effects. When substantial heterogeneity was identified (I2 ≥ 50%), we conducted a predefined subgroup analysis for the type of devices. All analyses were performed using Review Manager software (RevMan, Version 5.4.1. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020).

Assessment of certainty of evidence

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to measure and summarize the overall certainty of the current evidence of each outcome [32] through the ‘GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool’ software [33].

Post hoc analysis

Two additional outcomes were added after peer review of the published protocol [27] to provide additional information to analyze the data along with the percentage of time in the SpO2 target, as follows: (a) the percentage of time with hyperoxemia and (b) the percentage of time with hypoxemia. The criteria for hypoxemia and hyperoxemia were considered based on the definitions provided in the studies. We were concerned with carefully verifying the direction of effect and the impact of these data in meta-analyses, describing the contribution of these trials when necessary. In addition, we conducted two posthoc analyses, one comparing the percentage of time in the SpO2 target for subgroups according to the duration of the intervention, and one in subgroups according to the reason for admission, i.e., medical or surgical.

Results

Studies included

A total of 14,256 records were identified, and 37 records from 21 studies [34–54] enrolling 1,577 participants were included (Fig 1 and Table 1 and S7–S9 Tables in S1 File). Of those, 13 studies [34–38,40,42,45,51,52] investigated closed-loop oxygen control systems for use with invasive mechanical ventilation, and 8 studies [41,43,44,46–50] investigated closed-loop oxygen control systems for use with noninvasive respiratory support. Nine studies [36,37,40,44,46–49,54] could be used in the meta-analysis. Further details can be found in the S10 and S11 Tables in S1 File.

Risk of bias for randomized clinical trials

Most of the outcomes presented some concerns [40,42,46,47,50,51,54] mainly due to insufficient information on the randomization process such as allocation concealment and baseline characteristics (Fig 2). Only for costs [48], all domains presented a low risk of bias due to the completed and desirable information provided. For adverse events, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), mortality and time to oxygen weaning, in addition to concerns due to the lack of information from the randomization process, the lack of details on the pre-specified analysis defined a priori motivated the judgment of some concerns among the evaluators [47,50,51,54]. Of note, for adverse events from the seven studies that evaluated this outcome, in addition to the concerns cited about the randomization process, one study [51] lacks information from blinding of outcome assessors.

Risk of bias for randomized cross-over trials

Adverse event is the only outcome that included five studies and only one of them [43] had an overall ’low risk’ of bias (Fig 3). We were concerned about the actual impact of the insufficient information available to assess both proper randomization [34,38,39,45,49,53] and appropriate carry-over time in all outcomes [38,39,45,49,35]. As information from the first phase was not available for most of the crossovers, it was not possible to precisely assess whether there was a deviation from the intended interventions [35,38,43]. We did not find any evidence of missing outcome data or differences between groups for ’measure of outcome’ for all outcomes planned in this review and thus considered it as low risk of bias. Furthermore, it was not possible to assess whether a selection of the reported result of the outcomes was due to the absence or insufficient reporting information from the registered protocol [35,45].

Time spent in predefined SpO2 targets, percentage of time with hypoxemia or hyperoxemia, and weaning

The included studies had different SpO2 targets (S1 Fig in S1 File). In 7 studies [37,40,44,46–49], closed-loop oxygen titration devices increased the percentage of time in the predefined SpO2 target with substantial heterogeneity, not completely explained by the planned and post hoc subgroup analysis (Fig 4, S2 and S3 Figs and S11 Table in S1 File). The sensitivity analysis for the percentage of time in the SpO2 target, included only trials with a low risk of bias (S4 Fig in S1 File) and showed similar estimates of the intervention and inconsistency. There’s no clinically important difference in effect estimates between the meta-analysis encompassing all studies and the one focusing solely on studies with a low risk of bias, any inconsistency is likely to be insignificant [55]. Despite the observed asymmetry in the funnel plot (S5 Fig in S1 File), we cannot definitively attribute it to publication bias due to the limited number of studies included in this outcome. In 6 studies [36,37,40,46,48,49], closed-loop oxygen titration reduced the percentage of time with hypoxemia, with substantial unexplained heterogeneity, due to imprecise results of 2 studies [36,49] (S6 Fig in S1 File). In 4 studies [36,46,48,49] closed-loop oxygen titration did not reduce the percentage of time with hyperoxemia, with substantial heterogeneity and inconsistency in 2 studies [36,46] (S7 Fig in S1 File).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; HFNC = high flow nasal cannula; i-ASV = INTELLiVENT-Adaptive Support Ventilation; SD = standard deviation.

Four studies [38,43,45,53] were not included in the quantitative analyses due to the absence of reported data from the first crossover period. The mean percentage of time spent in the SpO2 target, ranging from 92 to 96%, was higher in the intervention group when compared to the control group, 83 (SD 21) versus 33 (SD 36), respectively [45]. These findings were similar to one study [43] published, in which the estimated effect presented, a mean difference (MD) of 38.5% [95% CI, 27.8 to 49.3]. One study [38] investigated 265 mechanically ventilated patients during daily nursing procedures. The closed-loop group spent a mean percentage of time in the SpO2 target of 48 (SD 37), compared with the control group of 43 (SD 37). One study [53] investigated the duration during which mechanically ventilated patients maintained their SpO2 within the optimal breath zone, considering the SpO2 target and FiO2. They found that patients in the closed-loop group spent 61% of their time within the optimal oxygenation range, a statistically significant improvement compared to the 52% observed with conventional ventilation. One study [52] evaluated the time spent in the optimal zone (i.e., SpO2 target) in 60 participants. The mean time spent in the closed-loop and control group remained at the optimal zone of 192 (SD 52), and 25 (SD 124) minutes, respectively. This study [52] was not included in the quantitative analysis due to the absence of information on all patients included to change mean and SD data from minutes to percentage of time.

Clinical outcomes

Of all included studies, 10 studies [36,37,40,42,44,46–49,54] evaluated length of stay, and 10 studies [36,37,39,40,42,45,47,49,50,54] evaluated mortality. In most studies, the intervention was not applied throughout the total duration of oxygen supplementation (S11 Table in S1 File). We considered it inappropriate to meta-analyze these details.

Costs

Of all studies, only one study [48] investigated hospitalization costs, and 2 studies [45,49] evaluated oxygen consumption. These studies suggest that closed-loop oxygen titration systems may result in a reduction in costs and oxygen consumption (S11 Table in S1 File).

Adverse events

Of all studies, 14 studies [34,35,37–39,42–48,51,52] reported adverse events. Quantitative analyses were not performed due to the wide variety and the absence of a standardized definition of adverse events (S11 and S12 Tables in S1 File).

Healthcare workload

Of the 7 studies [35–37,42,44,49,54] that evaluated the workload of healthcare professionals, 4 studies [36,37,44,54] were included in a quantitative analysis, suggesting that closed-loop oxygen control may reduce healthcare workload (Fig 5). In the sensitivity analyses excluding trials with some concerns according to the risk of bias assessment (S8 Fig in S1 File), we observed a slight increase in the heterogeneity (I2 = 83%) maintaining the direction of the effect of interventions (MD -4.94, 95% CI -9.43 to -0.46).

Discussion

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis show that closed-loop oxygen control devices may increase the percentage of time in the SpO2 target and reduce the percentage of time with hypoxemia. Closed-loop oxygen titration was found not to be associated with a lower percentage of time with hyperoxemia, time for weaning supplemental oxygen, adverse events, length of stay, and mortality. The evidence suggests that closed-loop oxygen titration may reduce costs, oxygen consumption and healthcare workload.

Although both are harmful, episodes of hypoxemia (i.e., SpO2 < 90 to 92%) are frequently regarded as a ‘red flag’ when compared with hyperoxemia episodes (i.e., SpO2 > 94–96 to 100%). Consequently, supplemental oxygen is typically considered to be widely available and liberally administered, with little to no attention given to avoiding excessive use. Closed-loop systems for oxygen titration seem to increase the time spent in the SpO2 target, contributing to the correct dose adjustment of oxygen and avoiding hypoxia episodes. However, it may not effectively reduce the occurrence of hyperoxemia, particularly in mechanical ventilation systems, or when high oxygen targets are being used. For instance, one trial [36] showed a high incidence of hyperoxemia with automatic oxygen control; however, this incidence was also high in the control group (35% vs. 33%). The included studies reported the use of different upper limits of SpO2 target and timing of intervention, making it difficult to compare the results. In this scenario, the predefined width range could have influenced the results of the percentage of time in the SpO2 target, hyperoxemia and hypoxemia. Substantial heterogeneity was also found for the percentage of time spent in the SpO2 target, not fully explained by subgroup analysis. The duration of the intervention and the different patient characteristics, could explain the substantial heterogeneity observed among the studies included in the subgroup analysis of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation support.

Supplemental oxygen use is frequently observed in patients admitted to hospitals and is considered one of the most common treatments provided to critically ill patients. The underrecognition and delay in the correction of hypoxemia remains a major problem in clinical practice associated with an increase in mortality [56], especially in settings where resources are limited and in countries or regions [57]. In addition to socioeconomic factors, the health crisis triggered by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted inequities related to an unprecedented need for oxygen supply and other resources, such as ICU beds, specialized professionals, invasive and noninvasive ventilators, and other medical supplies [58], and consequently, the indices of mortality in patients with and without COVID-19 significantly increased [59,60].

Investments in technology to develop new innovative devices for closed-loop oxygen titration that can efficiently manage resources have grown exponentially in recent years for both clinical and research uses. This was also observed in our findings, as most of the included trials were industry-sponsored investigations. Furthermore, unusual situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance and need to rationally use oxygen in clinical practice, as prolonged use of unnecessary supplemental oxygen increases health costs, ICU, and hospital stays, exposing patients to infections and psychosocial complications resulting from the hospitalization process. Despite the benefits of closed-loop devices for oxygen titration, the clinical use at bedside is still limited, due to the high initial investment necessary to acquire such technology. The direct cost related to closed-loop oxygen titration systems was evaluated in only one study [48], and oxygen consumption, an indirect measure of cost, was evaluated in two studies [45,49], showing inaccurate results due to the small number of included patients. Future studies should investigate ‘cost outcome’ to assist decision-makers in providing an assertive plan for closed-loop oxygen titration device implementation for clinical and research uses.

Patients admitted to the ICU are frequently exposed to different procedures, such as physical therapy and rehabilitation interventions (e.g., airway clearance, suctioning, and positioning), which can promote respiratory and hemodynamic changes according to their clinical condition. In addition, lung dynamics are directly affected by the patient’s clinical presentation. Thus, it can require frequent parameter adjustments during invasive or noninvasive ventilation support to maintain the predefined target of SpO2, increasing the workload of healthcare professionals. Closed-loop devices cannot replace healthcare professionals as they cannot handle complex clinical changes in oxygen adjustments. However, they can ease the workload of professionals by automating oxygen adjustments and freeing up time for patient care. These devices do not eliminate the need for clinical discussions and adjustments, especially for significant changes. They require alarms and data visualization for informed decision-making. While their safety is not clearly defined, they offer a potential way to reduce bedside tasks; however, more research on adverse events is needed due to oxygen-related risks. The identification and reporting processes of adverse events can be challenging. Researchers may consider the inclusion of adverse events as an outcome, reporting additional details of the definition, occurrence, and classification of events.

Strengths and limitations

This review has strengths that have helped reduce potential bias in the review process, such as a thorough literature search, rigorous and well-established methods to minimize bias, including multiple reviewers to independently screen abstracts, review studies, extract data, assess the risk of bias and the certainty of evidence outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration [30]. In addition, primary study authors were contacted to provide additional information, data, or clarifications when needed. For crossover randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we also contacted authors to request data from the first phase of interventions to describe baseline characteristics and results separately from patients randomized to each stage. We, therefore, believe that it is unlikely that we missed any relevant trials. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis provided important insights. Additional studies investigating the use of closed-loop oxygen systems through the entire duration of oxygen support should be developed to improve the findings for certainty of evidence.

However, this review has some limitations. First, due to the short intervention period in most studies it was difficult to establish a direct relationship between the device and the patient’s length of stay, mortality and time for oxygen weaning. It is important to emphasize that most studies in this meta-analysis featured brief intervention periods, ranging from only a few hours to 24 hours. This limitation diminishes the generalizability of the results to patients necessitating prolonged oxygen therapy, typically those in the most critical condition. Second, despite our considerable efforts to mitigate publication bias, we were unable to reliably assess it through the funnel plot due to the limited number of available studies. Third, there was insufficient information about the randomization process of some studies, so we recommended the use of reliable methods (e.g., computer-generated random numbers) and detailed reporting to ensure homogeneity between groups. Fourth, the washout period between interventions of crossover RCTs was short and heterogeneous, and the possibility of the carry-over effect cannot be ruled out. Although the devices provide the same substance (oxygen), the type of device can influence the patient’s stability. Fifth, the findings of the invasive mechanical ventilation subgroup should be interpreted with caution. Automatic mechanical ventilation modes adjust a group of ventilation settings such as tidal volume, respiratory rate, FiO2, and positive end-expiratory pressure. Thus, the findings of this review regarding the percentage of time spent in the SpO2 target cannot be solely attributed to the oxygen titration. Additionally, the number of adjustments in ventilation parameters may also have influenced healthcare workload outcomes.

In summary, while closed-loop oxygen titration systems probably increase the percentage of time spent within desired SpO2 ranges and reduce healthcare workload and costs, their safety remains uncertain. Adverse events are likely underreported in existing studies. Moreover, the extent to which these systems enhance efficiency, such as by reducing the duration of oxygen weaning, and even more importantly, by affecting length of stay and mortality rates, remains unclear. This uncertainty primarily stems from the limited duration of the intervention in the scarce, and small existing studies. Future research should focus on evaluating effectiveness, safety, and efficacy over longer periods, and prioritize patient-centered endpoints.

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: The meta analysis has been thoroughly conducted but there are various issues which need consideration

1 Most studies have a very short duration of intervention ranging for only few hours which will make it difficult to generalise the results for patients requiring oxygen for prolonged duration

2 Exclusion criterion in various studies can be included

3 Hyperoxeia is equally detrimental specially in patients with Type 2 respiratory failure patients. What were the causes of hyperoxia in closed loop systems should be briefly discussed

4 Subgroup analysis based on duration of intervention should be done as there are various studies having intervention for more than 24 hours.

5 Separate analysis for studies with post surgical patients and patients with medical conditions requiring supplemental oxygen should be considered

Reviewer #2: The aim of your study was to evaluate whether closed-loop oxygen control systems are effective, efficient and safe.

Despite heterogeneity of studies it was seen that Closed-loop oxygen titration are effective in reducing costs, oxygen consumption and healthcare workload.

Are they safe - No; as they resulted in longer patient times with hyperoxemia

Are they efficient -No; as time for weaning from supplemental oxygen's not shown to reduce with these systems and they had no effects on ventilator associated adverse events, length of stay, and mortality.

Please include the same clearly in conclusions.

Reviewer #3: The authors have made a substantial effort to collate the literature and come to a reasonable conclusion. However, this meta analysis does not have a funnel plot to look at the publication bias. There is considerable heterogeneity(I2=80.1%) and lacks a sensitivity analysis.

Dear prof. Vijay Hadda, dear editor,

We sincerely appreciate the opportunity to submit the revised version of our manuscript entitled ‘Closed-loop Oxygen Control for Critically Ill Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis’.

Your comments and those of the respected reviewers were very helpful for revising the work, we have meticulously implemented changes to enhance the quality and clarity of our manuscript.

Below, we provide a detailed point-by-point response to the reviewer’s comments.

We look forward to your response, and also the responses from the reviewers if they get a second chance to review our work.

Kindest regards, and on behalf of all coauthors,

Caroline Gomes Mól

 

ACADEMIC EDITOR:

1. The language need thorough check for grammar and syntax.

Thank you for your comment. We have carefully reviewed both the manuscript and supporting information, conducting a thorough check for grammar and syntax.

2. Also, it would be better if main results can be presented as main text, instead of supplementary.

Thank you for your comment. As suggested, we have transferred certain topics and figures from the supplementary material to the main text, as outlined below:

● [Page 9; line 10] S1 Appendix. Overall risk of bias for each planned outcome.

● [Page 9; line 13; Figure 2; ‘5. [PLoS One - Major Revision] Fig 2 Rob RCT’] S1 Fig. Risk of bias of RCT included studies.

● [Page 9; line 24; Figure 3; ‘6. [PLoS One - Major Revision] Fig 3 Rob RCT crossover’] S2 Fig. Risk of bias of crossover included studies.

● [Page 11; line 3] S3 Appendix. Summary of studies not included in the quantitative analyses.

● [Page 12; line 15; ‘7. [PLoS One - Major Revision] Fig 5’] S10 Fig. Forest plot of healthcare professionals' workload.

Reviewer 1

1. Most studies have a very short duration of intervention ranging for only few hours which will make it difficult to generalize the results for patients requiring oxygen for prolonged duration.

Thank you for your comment. This is a very valid and important comment. We added this limitation to the limitations section of the Discussion of the revised version of the manuscript, as follows:

● [Page 16; line 13] ‘It is important to emphasize that most studies in this meta-analysis featured brief intervention periods, ranging from only a few hours to 24 hours. This limitation diminishes the generalizability of the results to patients necessitating prolonged oxygen therapy, typically those in the most critical condition.’

2. Exclusion criterion in various studies can be included.

We appreciate your suggestions. Exclusion criteria of studies are now provided in table 1 as follows:

3. Hyperoxemia is equally detrimental especially in patients with Type 2 respiratory failure patients. What were the causes of hyperoxemia in closed-loop systems should be briefly discussed.

Thank you for your comment and question. The percentage of time with hyperoxemia ranged from less than 1% to 35% in the closed-loop group and less than 1% to 31% in the manual titration group, and this was found to be not statistically different. Of note, in most of the studies, the duration of hyperoxemia was short. In the one study with a high percentage of time with hyperoxemia (Arnal, 2018), utilization of INTELLiVENT–ASV resulted in 35% of time with hyperoxemia versus 31.33% with manual titration. We added the following to the revised version of the manuscript:

● [Page 13; line 15] ‘However, it may not effectively reduce the occurrence of hyperoxemia, particularly in mechanical ventilation systems, or when high oxygen targets are being used. For instance, one trial [36] showed a high incidence of hyperoxemia with automatic oxygen control; however, this incidence was also high in the control group (35% vs. 33%).’

4. Subgroup analysis based on duration of intervention should be done as there are various studies having intervention for more than 24 hours.

Thank you for this valuable suggestion. See also our response to your comment 5, below. According to this suggestion, and also your suggestion in comment 5, we conducted subgroup analyses considering the duration of the intervention, and type of ICU admission, focusing on the primary endpoint of our study. We added the findings as a post hoc analysis to the supplement, and added the following to the revised version of the manuscript:

● [Page 8; line 21] ‘In addition, we conducted two posthoc analyses, one comparing the percentage of time in the SpO2 target for subgroups according to duration of the intervention, and one in subgroups according to the reason for admission, i.e., medical or surgical.’

● [Page 10; line 11] ‘In 7 studies [37,40,44,46–49], closed-loop oxygen titration devices increased the percentage of time in the predefined SpO2 target with substantial heterogeneity, not completely explained by the planned and post hoc subgroup analysis (Fig 4, S2 Fig, S3 Fig and S11 Table).’

● [Supporting information page 5] ‘S2 Fig. Forest plot of subgroup analysis of duration of intervention for the percentage of time spent in the SpO2 target.’

● [Supporting information page 6] ‘S3 Fig. Forest plot of subgroup analysis of patient’s condition (medical or post-surgical) for the percentage of time spent in the SpO2.'

5. Separate analysis for studies with post-surgical patients and patients with medical conditions requiring supplemental oxygen should be considered.

See our reply to your comment 4, above.

Thank you for your comments and suggestions. We agree that there remains a substantial gap in our understanding of the safety and efficacy of closed-loop oxygen systems in reducing mortality rates and shortening hospital stays.

We revised the conclusion to better address these concerns raised, as follows:

● [Page 17; line 6]‘In summary, while closed-loop oxygen titration systems probably increase the percentage of time spent within desired SpO2 ranges and reduce healthcare workload and costs, their safety remains uncertain. Adverse events are likely underreported in existing studies. Moreover, the extent to which these systems enhance efficiency, such as by reducing the duration of oxygen weaning, and even more importantly, by affecting length of stay and mortality rates, remains unclear. This uncertainty primarily stems from the limited duration of the intervention in the scarce, and small existing studies. Future research should focus on evaluating effectiveness, safety, and efficacy over longer periods, and prioritize patient-centered endpoints.’

Reviewer 3

1. This meta-analysis does not have a funnel plot to look at the publication bias. There is considerable heterogeneity (I2=80.1%) and lacks a sensitivity analysis.

Thank you for your comment regarding the 'funnel plot' and sensitivity analysis. We appreciate and agree with your suggestion. We have incorporated sensitivity analysis for the main outcomes, as follows:

● [Page 10; line 14] ‘The sensitivity analysis for the percentage of time in the SpO2 target, included only trials with a low risk of bias (S4 Fig.) and showed similar estimates of the intervention and inconsistency. There's no clinically important difference in effect estimates between the meta-analysis encompassing all studies and the one focusing solely on studies with a low risk of bias, any inconsistency is likely to be insignificant [55].’

[Supporting information page 7] S4 Fig. Sensitivity analyses for the percentage of time spent in the SpO2 target

[Page 12; line 15] ‘In the sensitivity analyses excluding trials with some concerns according to the risk of bias assessment (S8 Fig), we observed a slight increase in the heterogeneity (I² = 83%) maintaining the direction of the effect of interventions (MD -4.94, 95% CI -9.43 to -0.46).’

[Supporting information page 13] S8 Fig. Sensitivity analyses for healthcare professional’s workload

We fully agree that the absence of a Funnel Plot analysis is a limitation of our systematic review. Despite the inclusion of only seven studies in the meta-analysis, we also performed the funnel plot for the percentage of time in the SpO2 target (see the figure below). However, the test for publication bias is severely underpowered for this outcome, and visual inspection of a funnel plot with few studies can be highly misleading. Thus, this result should be interpreted with caution. We have incorporated this information into the results and discussion section, as follows:

● [Page 10; line 19] ‘Despite the observed asymmetry in the funnel plot (S5 Fig.), we cannot definitively attribute it to publication bias due to the limited number of studies included in this outcome.’

● [Page 16; line 16] ‘Second, despite our considerable efforts to mitigate publication bias, we were unable to reliably assess it through the funnel plot due to the limited number of available studies.’

[Supporting information page 8] S5. Fig. Funnel plot for the percentage of time spent in the SpO2 target.

Your advice aligns with the suggestions made by other reviewers above, where subgroup analyses have been proposed with the aim of exploring how effect varies across different groups. (please refer to our response to comments 4 and 5 by reviewer '1').
