﻿Abstract

A new species of the mycoheterotrophic genus Thismia from Malaysia is described and illustrated. Thismiamalayana introduced here was found in two localities: in the lowlands of Gunung Angsi Forest Reserve, Negeri Sembilan, and in the hilly dipterocarp forests of Gunung Benom in Tengku Hassanal Wildlife Reserve, Pahang. Thismiamalayana falls into the section Thismiasubsect.Odoardoa, as it has creeping vermiform roots and free equal tepals. It is characterised by the following taxonomically important features: a sepia-brown, urceolate-curved floral tube, free equal tepals with terminal appendages, prominent bright yellow annulus and bright violet-blue stamens each bearing five appendages (one pair of club-shaped inwards-pointing, one pair of acute outwards-pointing, and one central appendage). According to the categories and criteria of the IUCN Red List, T.malayana is provisionally classified as Vulnerable.

The tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia together form the second largest area of tropical rainforests in the world. Also, the tropical lowland evergreen rainforest is the most species-rich forest formation in the region and structurally the most complex one, with species composition varying according to local soil and drainage conditions (Davis et al. 1995). Native plants of this type of forest include Thismia Griff., a genus of non-photosynthetic, mycoheterotrophic plants belonging to the family Thismiaceae. The genus Thismia comprises around 100 currently recognised species, and its range extends across various regions of the world, including tropical and subtropical Asia, northern and eastern Australia to New Zealand, the north-central USA, Costa Rica and southern tropical America (POWO 2024).

One of the most remarkable characteristics of Thismia is its mycoheterotrophic way of life. Unlike most plants, its species do not produce chlorophyll and are not capable of photosynthesis. A mycoheterotrophic plant is in fact a parasite of the mycorrhizal symbiosis, cheating it of the carbon resources that are shared in the mycorrhizal symbiosis, and this adaptation allows it to survive in the undergrowth of forests where the light availability is low (Merckx 2013; Watkinson 2016). Thismia species are known for their small size, which is usually only a few centimeters (Leake 1994). They are typically hidden in leaf litter and grow near tree roots or old rotten logs. Despite their small size, they are very sensitive to environmental changes, e.g. they decay easily when pulled out of its original habitat. Thismia species exhibit a number of unusual morphological features that continue to fascinate due to their amazing diversity of flower shapes and colours (Feller et al. 2022). The flower structure of Thismia is highly specialised to pollination by fungus gnats or other small insects (Thorogood and Siti-Munirah 2021). The flowers often have a complex shape with cup-like or spherical structures and intricate patterns that presumably attract pollinators. Due to their cryptic appearance, many Thismia species are still poorly known in terms of taxonomy and other biological aspects.

Another Thismia species is described here that is new to science. It was first discovered in 2020 in the Tengku Hassanal Wildlife Reserve (WR) (formerly known as Krau Wildlife Reserve) in the state of Pahang in Malaysia. It was later found also in a forested area in Ulu Bendul Recreation Park (RP), a popular nature and recreation area in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. It is located near the town of Kuala Pilah, about 25 kilometres from Seremban. The Ulu Bendul RP is also part of the Gunung Angsi Forest Reserve (FR) and offers nature lovers, hikers and explorers the opportunity to immerse themselves in the beauty of the tropical rainforest and discover its rich flora and fauna as well as its contribution to wildlife conservation. The type material of the new species was collected in February 2023 at the edge of the Gunung Angsi main trail in the forest area of Ulu Bendul RP.

﻿Materials and methods

The specimens of the new species were collected from both localities (Map 1), preserved in 70% ethanol and deposited in the Kepong Herbarium (KEP). Morphological characters were examined, and measurements were made using an Olympus SZ61 stereomicroscope and high-resolution macrophotography of fresh and preserved material. The morphology of the new species was carefully compared with all related species of the genus Thismia. Assessment of the conservation status according to the categories and criteria of the IUCN Red List (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2022).

Diagnosis.

Thismiamalayana resembles T.chrysops but differs by the brown-whitish colour of the floral tube (vs. very dark sepia brown), glabrous surface of the tepal appendages (vs. finely ciliate), presence of transverse bars at inner surface of floral tube (vs. bars absent), supraconnective apex of each stamen with 5 appendages: one pair of club-shaped inwards-pointing, one pair of acute outwards-pointing, and one central appendage (vs. 7 appendages: one pair of club-shaped, one pair of acute and 3 central appendages).

Ecology.

In medium-moist or mesic, shady areas of lowland dipterocarp forests at elevations of 200–450 m a.s.l. Flowering and fruiting usually from December to February but flowering also observed in June. According to the third and fourth author’s observations, T.malayana was only sighted and observed a few times a year, especially during the rainy season.

Etymology.

The specific epithet malayana is derived from Malaya, a name formerly used for Peninsular Malaysia. The epithet refers to the known region of the species distribution.

Conservation status.

According to the IUCN standards (IUCN 2022), we propose to classify the preliminary conservation status of Thismiamalayana as VU (Vulnerable). This particular species has only been found in two locations. One of the sites is located in a protected area (Tengku Hassanal WR), the other in a water catchment forest under the PRF class protection forest (Gunung Angsi FR), which also includes Ulu Bendul RP. Both habitats are therefore considered stable. However, the population of this species was detected near a hiking trail at both sites, which exposes this species to the risk of trampling due to its small size. During the survey conducted between 2022 and 2023, only less than 10 individuals were found. However, due to the limited time and area of the survey and also mycoheterotrophic nature of the species which remains hidden in the soil for most of its life, it was not possible to determine the estimated number of mature individuals in the population. Therefore, this species is classified as Vulnerable based on criterion D2.

Notes.

According to the classifications of Jonker (1938) and Kumar et al. (2017), T.malayana is placed in subgenus ThismiasectionThismiasubsectionOdoardoa Schltr. (Schlechter 1921), as it has six free, equal tepals and vermiform roots. Among the ThismiasubsectionOdoardoa, the following species share the curved or bent floral tube characteristic of T.malayana: T.chrysops from Johor (Gunung Ledang, Peninsular Malaysia) (Ridley 1895), T.cornuta from Sarawak (Malaysia) (Hroneš et al. 2018), T.inconspicua from Brunei (Sochor et al. 2017) and T.kinabaluensis from Sabah (Malaysia) (Nishioka et al. 2018). A detailed morphological comparison of T.malayana and these morphologically most similar four species is presented in Table 1.
