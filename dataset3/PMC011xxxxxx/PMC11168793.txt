==== Body
pmc A 76-year-old man underwent follow-up endoscopy after undergoing curative endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for esophageal cancer 1 . He had a past history of advanced pharyngeal cancer, which had been treated with chemoradiotherapy, and had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy because of persistent trismus ( Fig. 1 ). The follow-up endoscopy, performed via transnasal endoscopy, revealed a 6-mm depressed lesion in the lesser curvature of the antrum, and a biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma ( Fig. 2 ). ESD using a newly developed endoscope 2 3 was performed to treat the gastric cancer.

Fig. 2 Endoscopic images showing a slightly depressed lesion at the lesser curvature of the antrum viewed on transnasal endoscopy.

First, the catheter through the gastrostomy was removed and an endoscope with a diameter of 7.9 mm (EG-840TP; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted through the gastrostomy ( Fig. 3 ; Video 1 ). Circumferential marking, mucosal incision, and circumferential incision were performed, and submucosal dissection was subsequently performed until the tumor was resected en bloc ( Fig. 4 ), taking 9 minutes. The lesion was retrieved through the gastrostomy, and a new catheter was placed into the gastrostomy using a guidewire. The final pathologic diagnosis was a 6×6-mm, 0–IIc, well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, pT1a, pUL0, ly0, v0, pHM0, pVM0.

Gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection is performed through a gastrostomy using a newly developed thin endoscope.

Although the newly developed endoscope has a large working channel of 3.2 mm and offers wide angles (up 210°; down 160°), its small width of 7.9 mm enabled efficient ESD to be performed through the gastrostomy without dilation 1 .
