This bibliometric study aimed to analyze the citation metrics, journal and author characteristics, and subject domains of the 100 top-cited Systematic Reviews (SR) and Meta-Analysis (MA) in orthodontics.

Material and Methods:

An electronic database search was conducted for SR and MA in the Web of Science on 16th July 2023, without language and time restrictions. Of the 802 hits returned, the 100 top-cited orthodontic articles were shortlisted. They were analyzed for citation metrics, journal characteristics (journal, year of publication, impact factor-IF), author and affiliation characteristics (number, primary and corresponding author’s affiliation, and country), study domain, and keywords.

Results:

These articles were published from 1996 to 2021 in 20 journals, with an impact factor of 1.9 to 10.5, by 351 researchers affiliated with 104 universities. Their citations ranged from 45 to 344, and 34 poised to be classified as classic (≥ 100 citations). The maximum number of articles was published in the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics (n=38), the European Journal of Orthodontics (n=18), and the Angle Orthodontist (n=8). The authors for individual papers ranged from 1 to 10, with 5 being the most common (n=58). Europe had the highest contribution regarding the number of corresponding authors, institutions, and citations. Bone anchorage and orthodontic tooth movement/Biomechanics were the most frequently researched domains (n=11 each). The most common keyword used was Orthodontics (n=19), followed by Systematic Review (n=16) and Meta-analysis (n=9).

Conclusion:

In general, the top cited SR and MA were published in high-impact orthodontic journals, were multi-authored, and reflected the collaborative work from different universities.

Bibliometric analysis is a scientific computer-assisted review methodology that identifies core research characteristics by covering all the publications related to a given topic or field. It typically measures research outputs like publication counts, citation counts, and measurements derived from these data. 1 This information is a supporting tool for decision-making in setting research priorities, tracking the evolution of science and technology, funding allocation, and rewarding scientific excellence. 2 One of the standard bibliometric methods is citation analysis, which quantifies the number and relationship of references an article receives over time. 3 It also highlights the scientific progress and quality of research done throughout the years and the focus areas of active research. Despite being a time-dependent measure, it reflects the impact and progress of the research over the years, and is a widely used scientific quality indicator. 4

With evidence-based clinical decision-making gaining momentum in all fields of Medicine and Dentistry, including Orthodontics, there is an increased focus on publications providing higher evidence. 5 The widespread use of computer-based information systems and online access to publications have also enhanced the impact and utility of this evidence. According to the evidence-based Medicine pyramid, systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) provide the highest level of evidence, as they synthesize reliable information with varying levels of evidence from already available literature. 6 SRs are designed to answer specific questions by employing a predetermined, precise methodology to comprehensively search for, select, assess and analyze original research studies. SRs may or may not include formal MAs. MA is the statistical pooling of the results of studies that are part of a systematic review, and presents a significant advantage to SRs, by increasing the overall sample size by combining data from individual studies, thus increasing the statistical power and precision to assess the treatment effects. 7

Citation analyses in Orthodontics have often focused on the time frame of publication or emerging domains within the field, such as Lingual Orthodontics, 8 Temporary anchorage devices (TAD), 9 etc. However, citation analysis of level-one evidence constituting SRs and MAs has not been attempted. Further, information on the bibliometric characteristics of impactful, high-quality publications will help understand the trends in synthetic research. Hence, the current study was designed to identify and analyze the bibliometric characteristics of the 100 most-cited SRs and MAs in Orthodontics.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The Clarivate Analytics Web of Science (WoS) database has been widely used, being more accessible to historical literature. Therefore, a database search was performed in the WoS to track the top-cited SRs and MAs in Orthodontics. The search term in the topic field was entered as “(Systematic review OR Meta-analysis) AND Orthodont*” without any time and language restrictions. The systematic search was conducted on 16th July 2023. The results were sorted based on the number of citations, and the first 200 articles were selected and exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA), to evaluate their eligibility for inclusion in this study.

The preliminary screening of articles to assess their relevance to the study was performed independently by two authors (PV and US) based on the information from the title, abstract and the complete article, when required. Publications not directly related to orthodontics and those on craniofacial syndromes, cleft lip and palate were excluded. Any discordance related to the inclusion of a particular article was resolved by consensus discussion between all the authors. The hundred top-cited articles in the qualified list were included for data extraction and further analysis.

The information retrieved included the total number of citations, the journal of publication, year of publication, number of authors, details of the primary and corresponding authors (affiliation, position, and country), funding organization, the journal’s impact factor (IF), Digital Object Identifier (DOI), study type and domain, and keywords. 8 Manual data extraction and normalization were performed to unify terms and remove typographical errors. Normalization was carried out for the “Author,” “Organization,” and “Country of Origin” fields. 10 In cases of multiple and different entries for the same author, their affiliations were verified and confirmed through an internet search. Only universities and higher research centers were noted for the study’s affiliation field. Information regarding departments, private practice, and smaller centers was not considered. 8 , 10 The orthodontic study domains were classified as proposed by Aura-Tormos et al. 11

Two investigators (MS and BN) independently collected and tabulated the data. After completion, they were compared for concurrence. A periodic team review was conducted to settle all discrepancies, and the consensus data thus obtained was treated as final. The data analysis and pictorial representation of data were developed using Microsoft Office 365 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA).

RESULTS

An initial keyword search yielded 802 articles. The top 200 were exported for scrutiny in descending order of the number of citations. Twenty-five articles not fulfilling the eligibility criteria regarding subject matter were eliminated during screening, leaving 175 for further consideration. From the final list, the 100 most-cited articles were included for analysis (Table 1). The systematic selection of articles is depicted in the flow chart (Fig 1).

STUDY DOMAIN

There was a wide distribution of articles based on research domains in Orthodontics. A total of 21 domains were discussed among the top 100 cited systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Table 5). The most focused domains were orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) / biomechanics (11 articles, 1150 citations) and bone anchorage (11 articles, 969 citations). This was followed by digital Orthodontics, Class II management with functional appliances, and Aligners.

The top five cited articles were mostly related to root resorption (n=344), clear aligners (n=277), OTM (n=257), digital study models (n=219), and functional appliances (n=198). With the recent advances in digital Orthodontics, aligners, and fixed functional appliances, the volume of research with citations has increased significantly. Domains like dental trauma, vertical discrepancy, and bonding and bracket removal presented least number of articles with citations. Citation analysis of journals regarding the domain bone anchorage/mini-implant (n=9) showed that these articles were most commonly published in AJODO from 2007 to 2017 (Supplementary Table).

KEYWORDS

There were 212 unique keywords provided by 40 research papers in the lot. The most frequent were Orthodontics (n=19), Systematic review (n=16) and Meta-analysis (n=9). Details of keywords used thrice or more are presented in Table 6.

DISCUSSION

Citation metric is a popular quantitative measure of the impact of a research article in a particular domain. Bibliometric studies analyzing various aspects of this metric and its associated factors have been a common practice in many specialties of Dentistry. In Orthodontics, scientific mapping has been conducted in many areas, like Lingual Orthodontics, 8 TAD, 9 Orthognathic Surgery, 12 and Artificial Intelligence. 13 However, bibliometric studies on level one evidence articles are unavailable; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first in this regard.

Overall, the articles covered 21 subject domains. Orthodontic tooth movement/Biomechanics topped the list, with 1150 citations from 11 articles. This finding is not surprising, as this is a fundamental domain for the practice of Orthodontics. Three of the top five domains were related to recent evolutions in Orthodontics: Bone anchorage, Digital orthodontics, and Aligners. As recent advances in any field exhibit a higher knowledge gap, evoke more interest, and instigate more research and publications, it is natural to note increasing citations of seminal publications in the domain. 14 Among individual articles, the systematic review on root resorption by Weltman et al., 15 published by AJODO in 2010, topped the number of citations (n=344). This article reported high-quality evidence of risk factors associated with root resorption associated with fixed orthodontics. It should also be noted that nearly one-fourth of the articles were published in journals not exclusive to the specialty of Orthodontics, highlighting the need to go beyond specialty journals while searching for relevant content.

The scientific literature on Orthodontics is vast, and articles reaching over 100 citations are considered highly impactful and classic. It has been reported that less than 10% of the research papers fulfill the status of classic articles. 16 In larger research fields, articles with more than 400 citations are considered classics. However, the classic citation varies for each field. 17 In the present study, 34 articles had more than 100 citations and could be categorized as classic. This higher proportion is not surprising, since many of these publications pertain to the newer advances in the field, increasing in research and publications, and the tendency for authors to cite preferentially articles with higher levels of evidence. 18

Time since publication is an essential factor that impacts the citation metrics of an article. 8 Older articles receive more citations than recently published ones, due to the advantage of time and the snowball effect of subsequent related articles referring to older and primary articles. 8 , 19 Correlating with other studies, 19 , 20 more cited articles were published after 2010, highlighting the scientific expansion in Orthodontics focused on clinical trials and evidence-based practice. It is important to note that in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (IF: 8.4), an internationally recognized evidence-based Medicine journal, a handful of articles (n=5) were published. This might be due to the scarcity of clinical trials in Orthodontics to conduct well-designed MAs.

The IF of a journal is another factor influencing the citation metrics, and accounts for nearly 59% of the citation discrepancy. 21 In this study, top-cited SR and MA citations ranged between 45 and 344, and were published in high impact orthodontic journals. The IF of the journals included in this study ranged from 1.9 to 10.5, with a median of 3. The relationship between IF and the number of citations is bidirectional and mutually beneficial. High IF indicates high repute, visibility, and readership for the journal among peers. 22 This motivates the researchers to select these journals to publish their high-quality research. By virtue of quality, these publications inherently have a high potential for citations and boost the IF further over time.

Countries with better economic rankings are likely to publish the most impactful papers, which may be related to the availability and allocation of resources necessary to undertake such studies. 23 In agreement, 21 out of 100 articles were funded in this study, most of which belonged to developed nations (Supplementary Table). This study showed that 65 of 100 articles were from the top 10 countries in world economic rankings, based on GDP in 2023. 24 Concordant with similar studies, 4 , 10 , 25 the majority of corresponding authors were from Europe (n=62), with the United Kingdom (n=15) and Italy (n=14) being top contributors.

Another noteworthy observation was the number of authors involved with these publications. These top 100 articles were co-authored by 351 authors affiliated with 104 universities. The number of authors per paper varied from 1 to 10, with more than five authors in 58 publications. Further, 53 of 100 were international collaboration or multi-university research papers. These reiterate that collaboration is vital in elevating the impact of articles, and collaborative papers are expected to be more cited. 26

Keywords of scientific literature define the research field or topic, and enhance the visibility among peer researchers. 27 It is also essential to be in words rather than phrases or sentences. Therefore, it serves as a code for locating the required article. 17 , 27 It is no surprise that the most often used term was Orthodontics, followed by Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, given that this study focuses on SR and MA of orthodontic literature. Interestingly, considering that the maximum number of articles were based on bone anchorage and biomechanics, very few keywords were related to it. Clear Aligners (n=6) and Invisalign (n=4), related to the Aligner domain, were most commonly used. Most journals require keywords while submitting the manuscript, but it was unusual that many articles were without keywords. Some of the high-impact journals in the field of Orthodontics, like AJODO and the European Journal of Orthodontics (EJO), did not contain keywords (Supplementary Table). On the other hand, AJODO and EJO recorded the highest citation and maximum number of articles (n=56) among the top 100 cited articles.

LIMITATIONS

Using only Clarivate Analytics Web of Science’s (WoS) Science Citation Index (SCI) to identify the top-cited articles is a limitation. WoS gathers information from academic journals, books, book series, reports, and conferences. It provides access to current information and historical data from 1900 onwards for more than 8850 of the world’s most renowned academic journals in 150 scientific fields. Other options include the Scopus database, which tracks citations from 1996, which is a downside for considering citation analysis. Similarly, Google Scholar includes books, conference papers, theses, dissertations, unpublished data, and reports, influencing the citation count. However, WoS remains the most significant and widely utilized source database for bibliometric and citation analysis across all academic disciplines. 28 - 30 The current study may have missed articles published in non-indexed and non-English journals. The number of citations decides the impact and quality of an article; unfortunately, it could be time-dependent. Another shortcoming is the potential source of error in such bibliometric studies resulting from ‘self-citation’ 31 and ‘journal bias’. The former indicates the authors’ tendency to cite their publications, to improve their credentials and journal IF. Journal bias refers to the inclination of the authors to cite papers from the same journal targeted to publish their research. 32 , 33 Finally, the author’s actual affiliations were only considered if multiple institutions were present.

CONCLUSION

This descriptive bibliometrics analysis provides scientific evidence mapping of orthodontic literature. The 100 top-cited SR and MA in orthodontics were published from 1996 to 2021, with high-impact orthodontic journals (AJODO, EJO, and Angle Orthodontist) contributing the most. Thirty-four of them had already grossed a hundred citations or more. OTM/biomechanics and Bone anchorage were the trending domains. The articles were often multi-authored and involved collaborative work from different universities. Europe was the most productive in terms of authors and institutions. The findings may be of interest and useful to all prospective authors and synthetic research studies in Orthodontics.
