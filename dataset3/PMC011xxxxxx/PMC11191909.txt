Objective:

To quantify the association between insurance and hospital admission following minor isolated extremity firearm injury.

Background:

The association between insurance and injury admission has not been examined.

Methods:

This was an observational retrospective cohort study of minor isolated extremity firearm injury captured in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient and Emergency Department Databases in 6 states (New York, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Florida, and Maryland) from 2016 to 2017 among patients aged 16 years or older. The primary exposure was insurance. Admitted patients were propensity score matched to nonadmitted patients on age, extremity Abbreviated Injury Score, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index with exact matching within hospital to adjust for selection bias. A general estimating equation logistic regression estimated the association between insurance and odds of admission in the matched cohort while controlling for sex, race, injury intent, injury type, hospital profit type, and trauma center designation with observations clustered by propensity score-matched pairs within hospital.

Results:

A total of 8151 patients presented to hospital with a minor isolated extremity firearm injury between 2016 and 2017 in 6 states. Patients were 88.0% male, 56.6% Black, and 71.7% aged 16 to 36 years old, and 22.1% were admitted. A total of 2090 patients were matched on propensity for admission. Privately insured matched patients had 1.70 higher adjusted odds of admission and 95% confidence interval of 1.30 to 2.22, compared with uninsured after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics.

Conclusions:

Insurance was associated with hospital admission for minor isolated extremity firearm injury.

Mini Abstract:

This study sought to quantify the association between insurance and hospital admission following minor isolated extremity firearm injury. The main finding was that after matching for propensity to admit, privately insured patients had higher adjusted odds of admission compared with uninsured patients.

Patients with minor isolated extremity firearm injuries have historically been treated within the emergency department and discharged with “follow-up.”1–3 Most emergency departments have few resources to devote to outpatient care coordination of patients with minor injuries.4,5 Resources for home-based recovery from minor isolated extremity firearm injuries have been limited.6 Yet, even minor isolated extremity firearm injuries can lead to difficulties with activities of daily living at long-term follow-up.7

Clinicians can decide whether to admit patients with minor isolated extremity firearm injuries to hospital for inpatient pain control, physical therapy assessment, or comprehensive reassessment of the environment where they were injured. Inpatient hospital admission provides more time to coordinate postdischarge care, such as applying for health insurance, physical or occupational therapy, scheduling primary or wound follow-up care, arranging home health services, and evaluating social drivers of health.8,9 There is a literature gap evaluating patient characteristics associated with hospital admission for discretionary cases, such as minor isolated extremity firearm injuries.

The purpose of the study was to determine if health insurance was associated with inpatient hospital admission after minor isolated extremity firearm injuries. The first aim was to understand if between matched admitted and nonadmitted patients, privately insured individuals with minor isolated extremity firearm injuries would have greater adjusted odds of admission compared with uninsured individuals. The second aim was to compare discharge disposition and reinjury rates between matched admitted and nonadmitted patients. The hypothesis was that matched privately insured individuals with minor isolated extremity firearm injuries would have greater adjusted odds of admission compared with uninsured individuals and would have more frequent discharge to postacute care facilities and home assistance.

METHODS

Study Design

This was an observational retrospective cohort study evaluating the association between insurance and hospital admission among patients injured by a firearm from 2016 to 2017 across 6 states in the United States using data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). This study was approved by the University Institutional Review Board. The reporting followed the strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology reporting guidelines.10

Data Sources

Three data sets were used across New York, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Florida, and Maryland to identify patients who presented to hospital after a minor isolated extremity firearm injury. The Statewide Inpatient Database (SID) and State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) were developed by the HCUP.11 These data are statewide all-payer claims data sets that contain the inpatient and emergency department encounters for acute care hospitals. The combination of SID and SEDD includes all hospital visits for fatal and nonfatal injuries within the states above. The states above were included because they contained a patient identifier, “VisitLink,” which allowed linkage between all subsequent hospital encounters within the calendar year. These 6 states also provided hospital identifiers to link the SID and SEDD to the American Hospital Association (AHA) Survey data for detailed hospital characteristics.12

Study Population

Encounters for adult patients (age ≥16) who presented to an emergency department with a minor isolated extremity injury were identified using the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), 10th Revision (Supplemental Table 1, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A333). ICD external causes of morbidity codes that delineated firearm injury were included. Patients’ initial encounters with minor isolated extremity injuries were identified with the indicator “A” at the end of the ICD code to indicate that this was the new injury (eg, W320XXA). Only minor injuries were included as defined by an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores ≤2. Injury body region and severity were determined by converting ICD-10 injury diagnosis codes to AIS scores using the ICD Programs for Injury Categorization (ICDPIC).13 Injuries were categorized into different types (eg, fracture and dislocation) using the Center of Disease Control (CDC) Injury Diagnosis Matrix.14 Only encounters with isolated extremity injuries, defined as any patient with an upper or lower extremity AIS without coded injuries in other body regions, were included (Supplemental Figure 1, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A332).

Primary Predictor

The primary predictor was insurance status. Insurance status was captured using the expected primary payer reported by hospitals upon discharge. Insurance status was categorized as Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, uninsured, and other. Other included Worker’s Compensation, CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, Title V, and other government programs.

Primary Outcome

Hospital admission was determined based on whether the encounter was in the SID or only in SEDD. Emergency department discharges not admitted to hospital were defined as an SEDD encounter discharged from the emergency department without an accompanying SID record. Secondary outcomes considered included discharge disposition and reinjury. Discharge disposition was classified into 4 categories, home, transfer to acute care facility, transfer to postacute care facility/home health assistance, and other. Transfer to acute care facility was defined by the presence of SID encounter after SEDD encounter with corresponding admission and discharge dates, respectively, with identical VisitLink variable. Postacute care facility was defined as a discharge disposition of hospice, rehabilitation, long-term care hospital, psychiatric hospital, skilled nursing facility, or intermediate care facility and home health care. Other included leaving against medical advice and death. Reinjury was defined as a dichotomous variable based on whether a patient presented during the same year with a new firearm injury. The VisitLink variable was used to link subsequent hospital encounters to individual patients to estimate the rate of new firearm injuries after a minor isolated extremity firearm injury. Reinjury was classified as positive only if the patients had another later encounter with a firearm injury code with the ICD code indicator “A” in the same calendar year in SID or SEDD.

Patient Characteristics

Patient demographic and injury characteristics hypothesized to be associated with discretionary inpatient hospital admission were age, race, median income quartile, injury intent, injury type, and injury severity. Age was categorized into 16 to 36 years, 37 to 64 years, and greater or equal to 65 years old. Race/ethnicity was reported as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and other, which included multiracial, self-described, native, Asian/Pacific Islander. Race/ethnicity was presented to characterize race as a social construct as opposed to race as a biological driver for disparity in admission practices. Median income quartile was determined through the patient’s zip code from HCUP linked to Claritas ZIP Code-demographic data. The quartiles for 2016 were defined as Q1 = $1 to $42,999, Q2 = $43,000 to $53,999, Q3 = $ 54,000 to $70,999, and Q4 ≥ $71,000. The quartiles for 2017 were Q1 = $1 to $43,999, Q2 = $44,000 to $55,999, Q3 = $56,000 to $73,999, and Q4 ≥ $74,000. Injury intent was classified as unintentional injury, self-inflicted, assault, undetermined, and legal intervention. Injury type was classified as open wound/superficial injury, fracture/dislocation, and other using the CDC Injury Diagnosis Matrix.14 Injury severity was an ordinal variable classified as Extremity AIS using ICDPIC.13 Patient comorbidities were calculated using the Weighted Elixhauser Index of Comorbidity.15–18

Hospital Characteristics

Hospital characteristics hypothesized to be associated with inpatient hospital admission were bed size, teaching, medical school affiliation, urbanicity, trauma center designation, hospital profit status, and frequency of Medicaid discharges. Hospital bed size was collapsed into 4 categories <100, 100 to 299, 300 to 499, and ≥500 beds. Teaching status was captured by the American College of Graduate Medical Education accreditation classified as postgraduate teaching hospital or nonteaching hospital. Medical school affiliation was classified as medical school affiliated or nonaffiliated. Urbanicity was captured Core-Based Statistical Area classified as metro, micro, or rural. Trauma center designation was defined by AHA-specified trauma designation and when missing (13%) trauma designations were supplemented through state websites. Hospital profit status was classified as nonprofit, for profit, and government. Hospitals frequency of Medicaid discharges was defined based on all admissions for all causes by AHA Survey and classified as <10%, 10% to 19.9%, 20% to 49.9%, and ≥50%. Missing data were treated as missing at random and not imputed due to missingness of <1% in variables utilized for the analysis.

Statistical Analysis

Patient and hospital characteristics were compared in the total initial unmatched admitted cohort, and nonadmitted cohort using mixed model bivariate logistic regression with admission as the outcome and the characteristic of interest as the lone fixed effect with patient ID as a random intercept. A multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression predicting hospital admission included insurance, age, race, sex, injury intent, injury type, weighted Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, trauma center designation, and hospital profit type with observations clustered by subject within hospital. Discharge disposition and reinjury were compared using bivariate logistic regression using subject-level random intercepts and admission status as the outcome.

Propensity score matching was employed to address the clinician selection bias in the admission. Based on the results of the above multivariable analysis, admitted and nonadmitted patients were matched on age, extremity AIS score, and Weighted Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Exact matching within hospitals was specified, meaning that matched patient pairs were sampled from the same hospital to mitigate bias from hospital practice pattern differences. A 1:2 greedy match was used to preserve sample size with a caliper width of 0.2 to avoid dissimilar pairs. This caliper width was within a range that minimized the mean squared error by greater than 95%.19

Patient and hospital characteristics were compared in the matched admitted cohort versus nonadmitted cohort using mixed model logistic regression with admission status as the outcome and the characteristic of interest as the fixed effect with subject-level random intercepts. Informed by these results, a generalized estimating logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between insurance status and inpatient hospital admission while controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, injury intent, injury type, hospital profit type, and trauma level designation with observations clustered by matched pair within hospital. Self-inflicted injured patients were collapsed into the “other” intent for the propensity-matched model because of the extremely small sample size (64 patients in 2 years across 6 states). The critical trend in intent we successfully preserved in the propensity matching model was the higher likelihood of assaults to be admitted and the lower likelihood of unintentional injuries to be discharged home. Collapsing self-inflicted ensured that we could run the propensity-matched analysis to control for selection bias in admission. Discharge disposition and reinjury were compared between matched admitted and nonadmitted patients with minor isolated firearm extremity injury using mixed model logistic regression with listed characteristics as the outcome and admission as the lone fixed effect and subject ID as the random intercept.

A sensitivity analysis was performed by identifying individuals who underwent procedures (Supplemental Table 2, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A334) to determine if admission rates differed. Bivariate analyses were performed to compare the admitted cohort versus the nonadmitted cohort among individuals who underwent procedures. Patient and hospital characteristics among the admitted and nonadmitted patients who underwent procedures were analyzed using generalized estimating logistic regression with admission as the outcome and race, injury type, Elixhauser Comorbidity score, intent, zip code quartile, and hospital bed size as the fixed effects. Observations were clustered by subject within hospital. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). All P values were 2-tailed and P < 0.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS

Population Characteristics

A total of 8151 unique patients had a minor isolated extremity firearm injury with AIS 1 or 2 in New York, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Florida, and Maryland from 2016 to 2017. Patients were 88.0% male, 56.6% Black, and 71.7% were between the ages of 16 and 36 years. Only 1800 (22.1%) were admitted. A total of 1110 (13.6%) patients were reinjured presenting to hospital with a new firearm injury.

In the overall unmatched cohort, there were significant differences in patient and hospital characteristics between admitted and nonadmitted patients. A smaller proportion of admitted patients, 28.8%, had an AIS score of 2 compared with 33.3% of nonadmitted patients, P < 0.001 (Supplemental Table 3, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A335). Admitted patients had a higher mean Elixhauser Comorbidity Index of 0.9, SD 1.25, compared with 0.3, SD 0.62, among nonadmitted patients, P < 0.001. Patients in large, teaching, metropolitan level 1 trauma centers that were for-profit hospitals were most likely to be admitted (Supplemental Table 4, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A336). A larger proportion of admitted patients, 13.6%, were discharged to postacute care facilities or home health care compared with 1.6% among nonadmitted patients, P < 0.001 (Supplemental Table 5, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A337). Patient age, injury, intent, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics were associated with the highest adjusted odds of admission (Supplemental Table 6, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A338).

Propensity-Matched Cohort Characteristics

There were 2090 (26%) patients matched on propensity for admission. The matched cohort was better balanced though some differences between admitted and nonadmitted patients persisted. A larger proportion of admitted patients, 47.3%, were survivors of an assault, compared with 37.6% of nonadmitted patients, P < 0.001 (Table 1). A larger proportion of admitted patients, 55.6%, had a fracture or dislocation compared with 45.0% among nonadmitted patients, P < 0.001. The hospital differences were mostly eliminated with matching with the exception that metropolitan hospitals accounted for a slightly lower proportion of patients admitted, 95.9%, compared with nonadmitted, 97.7%, P = 0.02, but the difference was statistically but not clinically significant (Table 2).

Upon multivariable analysis of the matched cohort, unintentional injuries had a 0.58 lower adjusted odds of being admitted than assault-injured patients, with 95% confidence interval of 0.48 to 0.71(Table 3). Fracture/dislocations injuries had a 1.53 increased adjusted odds of being admitted compared with those with wounds/superficial injuries, with 95% confidence interval of 1.27 to 1.84. Privately insured matched patients had a 1.70 higher adjusted odds of admission, with 95% confidence interval of 1.29 to 2.22, compared with uninsured after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics.

Matched admitted patients were more likely to be discharged to postacute care facilities or home health care, 11.3%, compared with 1.7% among nonadmitted patients, P < 0.001 (Table 4). Reinjury was similar between admitted and nonadmitted matched patients.

§ Reinjury was defined as whether or not a patient presented to any hospital during the same calendar year for a new firearm injury.

Sensitivity analyses examining only those in the unmatched cohort who received procedures were limited by a skewed distribution toward admitted patients (n = 741 of 770, 94.6%). Most frequent procedures were blood transfusion (Supplemental Table 7, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A339). No significant differences were found between the admitted and nonadmitted patients based on whether they received a procedure in age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, zip code income quartile, intent, and AIS score (Supplemental Table 8, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A340). Similar to the larger cohort, however, a significantly higher number of the admitted receiving procedures experienced fracture/dislocation injuries (79.2%) compared with the nonadmitted (53.7%, P = 0.02). Those who were admitted also had greater comorbidity than the nonadmitted (mean Elixhauser Comorbidity Index = 1.0 vs 0.4, P = 0.04). There were no differences in hospital characteristics (Supplemental Table 9, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A341). Upon multivariable analysis, there was no difference in insurance status among individuals who underwent procedures and were admitted compared with nonadmitted individuals (Supplemental Table 10, see http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A342).

DISCUSSION

This study sought to determine if insurance status was associated with inpatient hospital admission after minor isolated extremity firearm injuries. Between matched admitted and nonadmitted patients, privately insured patients with minor isolated extremity firearm injuries had greater adjusted odds of admission compared with uninsured patients after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. Admitted patients in the propensity-matched cohort were more frequently discharged to another acute care, postacute care facility, or with home health care.

Various social drivers of health, including insurance status, may indirectly influence the shared decision with the patient and may also be impacted by admission itself. Health insurance is associated with both appropriate and inappropriate health care use.20,21 A self-pay patient may be more likely to wish not to be admitted because they bear the full burden of the health care cost. Furthermore, it is important that the insurance status listed for each patient is the insurance that is billed upon discharge. Many of our firearm-injured patients are uninsured upon admission and our multidisciplinary teams work quite hard to ensure they become insured upon discharge. This ensures hospitals will be remunerated for their inpatient care. It is likely that admitting a patient enables the social workers to apply for insurance as well as other outpatient support services such as home health as we observed. Emergency department social workers do not have the bandwidth or time to perform such activities in the few hours they interact with patients. Health insurance access can improve the timeliness of diagnosis, improve in-hospital and long-term survival, and increase overall health care utilization.22–26 Not all firearm injuries necessitate inpatient admission for direct medical care.1 Nguyen et al27 found that costs of care were reduced for patients with extremity firearm injuries who were treated with antibiotics and discharged from the emergency department. These cost savings must be weighed against the long-term cost associated with reinjury-associated readmission, which Spitzer et al28 found that 10% of total costs of firearm injury were due to readmission within the first 6 months after injury.

The implication of the study findings should be taken in the context of the lack of social safety net and social isolation in the United States, which can mean patients with minor isolated injuries do not have any support mechanisms in their community. Complications of isolated extremity injuries include vascular injury, nerve injury, and wound infections.29 Firearm-injured individuals are known to have new functional limitations, daily pain, and poor physical health-related quality of life.30,31 As a result, some hospitals have developed specific admission criteria for medical or social conditions.32,33 However, the medical community should reconsider whether there is an alternative to supporting patients with minor isolated extremity firearm injuries beyond inpatient admission. Examples can be outpatient transitional care programs, which can be cost-saving and reduce hospital use.34 Community-based organizations can address many of the social drivers of health that put patients at risk for injury and illness. Learning to effectively partner with these organizations will be critical given the new Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Framework for Health Equity that since January 2024 requires hospitals to collect, and soon address, social drivers of health in their communities.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, these all-payer claims data provide universal capture of all acute care hospital emergency department and inpatient encounters but provide very limited clinical granularity. For example, presenting symptoms such as vital signs were not captured in this data set. This bias was addressed by reducing sample heterogeneity of injury severity and focusing on isolated extremity firearm injuries with an AIS cutoff of 2 or less. Second, the standard mechanism to estimate AIS, ICDPIC, may have underestimated the AIS.35,36 This bias was addressed by also classifying injury type using ICD codes and the CDC Injury Matrix, then excluding patients with burns, crush, and nonisolated injuries as well as controlling for injury type in all multivariable regressions. Third, the reinjury secondary outcome was limited by the fact that the VisitLink variable was assigned by calendar year. The study underestimated the reinjury rates of patients within this data set. However, evidence suggests that most reinjuries occur within the first year.37 Fourth, the VisitLink variable was missing for 14% of the firearm-injured cohort. The VisitLink variable was created using identifiable patient data missing among undocumented and undomiciled patients. This likely led to the exclusion of undocumented and undomiciled patients from this study causing sampling bias. Sampling bias again likely underestimated reinjury rates since undomiciled have higher rates of assault,38 though presumably the underestimation of reinjury rates would have been similarly distributed between admitted and nonadmitted patients therefore not impacting the main study findings. Finally, only 6 states were included in the study due to the limited availability of VisitLink and AHA ID across states contributing to SID and SEDD leading to sampling bias as well. Nonetheless, geographically, demographically, and politically diverse states were selected to maximize generalizability.

CONCLUSIONS

This observational retrospective cohort study of minor firearm injuries across 6 states found that privately insured patients with minor isolated extremity firearm injuries had greater adjusted odds of admission compared with uninsured patients after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. Matched admitted patients were more frequently discharged to another acute care or postacute care facility or with home health assistance compared with nonadmitted patients. Reinjury rates were not different between matched admitted and nonadmitted patients.
