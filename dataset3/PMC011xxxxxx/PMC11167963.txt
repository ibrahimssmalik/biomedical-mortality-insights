==== Body
pmcTo celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first issue of Molecular Biology and Evolution, the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution (SMBE) journals are publishing a series of virtual issues in 2024. These virtual issues contain selected papers published in the society's journals, Molecular Biology and Evolution and Genome Biology and Evolution. Each virtual issue is accompanied by a Perspective that highlights the historic and contemporary contributions of our journals to a specific topic in molecular evolution.

June's Perspective, titled “Endosymbioses have shaped the evolution of biological diversity and complexity time and time again”, appears in Genome Biology and Evolution and was written by Gordon M. Bennett, Younghwan Kwak, and Reo Maynard. The accompanying virtual issues—one for Molecular Biology and Evolution and one for Genome Biology and Evolution—include noteworthy papers on the Evolutionary Impacts of Endosymbiosis published in the two journals and can be found at SMBE's 40th anniversary site.
