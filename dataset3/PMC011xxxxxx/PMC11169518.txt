pmcCorrection to: Nutrition and Diabetes 10.1038/s41387-024-00285-3; published online 16 May 2024

In this article the statement in the Funding information section was incorrectly given as ‘“......PI21/00383 to Elena M Yubero-Serrano), integrated into the framework of the National Plan for Scientific Research, Technological Development and Innovation 2013-2016, co-financed by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) of Spain and also by the General Directorate for Assessment and Promotion of Research and the EU’s EuropIean Regional Development Fund (FEDER)

‘and should have read

“......PI21/00383 to Elena M Yubero-Serrano), funded by Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) and co-funded by the European Union”

The original article has been corrected.
