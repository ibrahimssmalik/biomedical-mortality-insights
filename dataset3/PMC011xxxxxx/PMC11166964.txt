The target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) signaling is associated with plasma membrane (PM) integrity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling controls sphingolipid biosynthesis, and Ypk1/2 phosphorylation by TORC2 under PM stress conditions is increased in a Slm1/2-dependent manner, under which Slm1 is known to be released from an eisosome, a furrow-like invagination PM structure. However, it remains unsolved how the activation machinery of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling is regulated. Here we show that edelfosine, a synthetic lysophospholipid analog, inhibits the activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, and the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway is involved in this inhibitory effect. The activation of CWI pathway blocked the eisosome disassembly promoted by PM stress and the release of Slm1 from eisosomes. Constitutive activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling exhibited increased sensitivity to cell wall stress. We propose that the CWI pathway negatively regulates the TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, which is involved in the regulatory mechanism to ensure the proper stress response to cell wall damage.

TORC2 signaling, which is associated with the plasma membrane integrity, is activated by the membrane stress in S. cerevisiae. A mechanism for the negative regulation of TORC2 signaling by the cell wall integrity pathway was identified in this study.

pmcIntroduction

Cells maintain cellular homeostasis by sensing and responding to various extracellular and environmental conditions and adapting accordingly. Signal transduction pathways are crucial for transmitting extracellular stress signals to cells, and in most cases, the plasma membrane (PM) functions as a place to initiate and regulate these signaling pathways. Evolutionarily conserved protein kinase TOR (target of rapamycin) forms two distinct complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2), and the signaling pathways to which these complexes contribute are essential for cell growth, metabolism, and stress response1–4. TORC2 activity is closely associated with the PM5–7, and yeast TORC2 localizes at the domain just beneath the PM, which is known as the membrane compartment containing TORC2 (MCT) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae6,8,9. Additionally, a role of TORC2 in response to the PM stretch and stresses has been reported in neutrophils, Dictyostelium, and yeast, and TORC2 signaling is associated with the PM integrity and dynamics6,10–13. Therefore, TORC2 signaling is believed to play an important role in sensing the state of the PM7,13,14.

In S. cerevisiae, TORC2 phosphorylates Ypk1 and its paralog Ypk2 (hereafter Ypk1/2), and Pkc1, all of which belong to the AGC (named initially for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases and protein kinase C) kinase family, and TORC2 targets the conserved Ser/Thr residues within the turn and hydrophobic motifs of their C-terminal region9,13,15,16. TORC2 phosphorylates Ypk1/2, the ortholog of mammalian SGK117, at Ser644/641 in the turn motif involved in their stability and at Thr662/659 in the hydrophobic motif involved in their activity9,13,15. Ypk1/2 positively regulate sphingolipid biosynthesis, a primary lipid constituting eukaryotic PM, via increased phosphorylation of Orm1 and Orm2 (hereafter Orm1/2), which negatively regulate the first step enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase, and increased phosphorylation of Lag1/Lac1, which are catalytic subunits of the ceramide synthase18–21. Therefore TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling plays a role in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, which are essential for PM integrity13,19,20,22,23. Ypk1 phosphorylation at Thr662 in its hydrophobic motif by TORC2, which is necessary for Orm1/2 phosphorylation19, is increased in response to the PM stretch triggered by hypo-osmotic shock and PM stress induced by the inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis6,9,24. It has been reported that PM-associated proteins, Slm1 and Slm2 (hereafter Slm1/2), which ensure the interaction between TORC2 and Ypk1/2, are crucial for the activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling caused by inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism (e.g., myriocin and aureobasidin A, AbA) or PM stretch6,9,24. Slm1/2 possess an F-BAR domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which can bind to membrane curvature and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) enriched in PM, respectively25,26. Under nonstressed growth conditions, Slm1/2 localize prominently at furrow-like invagination structures of the PM organized by proteins, which are called eisosomes6,27. As a model for TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling activation, it has been shown that when cells are exposed to hypo-osmotic shock or inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis, Slm1/2 are released from the eisosomes and their localization to the MCTs are increased, enhancing Ypk1/2 phosphorylation by TORC26,9. Additionally, it is known that eisosome disassembly is accelerated during the condition where the inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis activate the TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling28–30. Conversely, a reduced PM tension triggered by hyper-osmotic shock has been reported to emerge an invaginated PM structure in which PtdIns(4,5)P2 accumulates (called the PtdIns(4,5)P2-enriched structure; PES), and the TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling is inactivated by sequestering TORC2 at the PES12. Therefore, PM dynamics are closely associated with an activity of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, and eisosomes, Slm1/2, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 are expected to play crucial roles in the mechanism of this association, although its regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Pkc1, another TORC2 target, is an ortholog of mammalian protein kinase Cs. TORC2-Pkc1 signaling is activated by methylglyoxal (MG), a natural glycolysis-derived metabolite, and modulates the Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is a downstream signaling of Pkc116,31. Pkc1 is also a component of the cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway involved in the remodeling of cell walls and expression of stress response genes through Mpk1 MAPK, and the activation of the CWI pathway is induced by heat shock and cell wall stresses31–34. The stress-induced activation of the CWI pathway is mainly caused through the membrane proteins Wsc1 and Mid2, which are sensors for the CWI pathway31,35, but these sensor proteins are dispensable for the MG-induced activation of TORC2-Pkc1 signaling16, i.e., Pkc1 is thought to be modulated separately by the TORC2 and CWI pathways, respectively.

Recently, we have shown that MG also activates TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, and mutants of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling exhibit increased susceptibility to MG36. Meanwhile, we have also previously identified mutants defective in ergosterol biosynthetic process as MG-sensitive mutants in addition to mutants defective in the sphingolipid biosynthetic process37. In this study, we focused on the influence of ergosterol dynamics on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, and found that edelfosine, a lysophosphatidylcholine analog, which has an affinity for sterols and affects the movement of PM sterols38–40, inhibited the activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling. The inhibitory effect of edelfosine was exerted through CWI pathway activation, and eisosome structures are indispensable for this inhibitory effect. The activation of the CWI pathway blocked eisosome disassembly and the release of Slm1 from eisosomes, which were accelerated by the inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis. We also found that the inhibitory effect through CWI pathway activation on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling was involved in an adaptive response to cell wall stress. Our results provide insights into the mechanism by which the CWI pathway contributes to the regulation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling.

Results

Edelfosine inhibits TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling activation

TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling positively regulates sphingolipid biosynthesis, and membrane stresses caused by sphingolipid metabolism inhibitors, e.g., myriocin and AbA, increase phosphorylation levels at the hydrophobic motif (Thr662/Thr659) of Ypk1/2 by TORC26,9,20. Mutants of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling or sphingolipid biosynthesis exhibit increased susceptibility to those inhibitors19,41. We have recently shown that MG enhances the phosphorylation levels of Ypk1/2, and mutants of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling exhibits increased susceptibility to MG36. A previous study using genetic screening showed that mutants defective in sphingolipid biosynthesis, csg2∆ and isc1∆ cells, exhibited MG sensitivity. Moreover, mutants defective in ergosterol biosynthesis, erg2∆, erg3∆, and erg6∆ cells, also had increased MG susceptibility37 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We anticipated the relationship between ergosterol and TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling activation, but no severe defect in either AbA or MG-induced Ypk1/2 phosphorylation was observed in those mutants (Supplementary Fig. 1b). It has been suggested that the sterol-binding protein involved in the transport of ergosterol from the PM to the cortical ER is related to TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling42. We therefore examined whether the ergosterol dynamics at the PM influence TORC2 signaling activation using sterol targeting reagents, amphotericin B, nystatin, filipin, and edelfosine38,43. As shown in Fig. 1a, b, amphotericin B, nystatin, and edelfosine strongly inhibited both AbA and MG-induced Ypk1/2 phosphorylation. Amphotericin B and nystatin are polyene antibiotics that are potent antifungal agents43,44, and their toxicities were exerted under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1c). In contrast, edelfosine had no significant influence on cell viability (Fig. 1c), and therefore we focused the inhibitory effect of edelfosine on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling.Fig. 1 Edelfosine inhibits TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling.

a, b Wild-type (BY4741) cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM amphotericin B (AmB), 5 µM nystatin (Nys), 5 µg/ml filipin (Fili), or 5 µM edelfosine (Edel) for 15 min, and were then further grown for another 60 min after the addition of 1.25 µM AbA (a) or 15 mM MG (b). Phosphorylated Ypk1/2 or Ypk1 was detected with anti-phosphorylated Ypk1T662 and Ypk2T659, or anti-Ypk1 antibody, respectively; a band of phosphorylated Ypk1/2 or Ypk1 was indicated by arrowhead. c Wild-type (BY4741) cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and treated with 5 µM amphotericin B (AmB), 5 µM nystatin (Nys), or 5 µM edelfosine (Edel) for 60 min, and viability was determined by counting the number of colonies after plating cells on YPD agar plates. The viability before the addition of the reagents was set as 100%. Data are from three independent experiments (mean ± s.d.). d Wild-type (BY4741) cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 15 min, and were then further grown for another 60 min after addition of 1.25 µM AbA, 1.25 µM myriocin (Myr), or 15 mM MG. The phosphorylated Ypk1/2 or Ypk1 was detected as described in (a). e Wild-type (BY4741) cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 µM edelfosine for 15 min, and further grown for another 60 min after addition of 1.25 µM AbA. Phosphorylated Ypk1/2 or Ypk1 was detected as described in (a). f Wild-type (BY4741) cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 15 min, and treated with 1.25 µM AbA for the prescribed times. Phosphorylated Ypk1/2 or Ypk1 was detected as described in (a). g Wild-type (BY4741) cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and treated using 5 µM edelfosine for 60 min, and then were spotted in 5-fold serial dilution onto SD agar plates with AbA. The plates were scanned after incubation for 3 days at 28 °C. h Wild type (BY4741) and lem3∆ cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 15 min and were then further grown for another 60 min after the addition of 1.25 µM AbA. Phosphorylated Ypk1/2 or Ypk1 was detected as described in (a). i fps1∆ cells were cultured in SD medium with 1 M sorbitol until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 45 min. Cells were collected and transferred to SD medium without sorbitol to expose them to hypo-osmotic shock. Phosphorylated Ypk1/2 or Ypk1 at the prescribed times after hypo-osmotic shock was detected as described in (a). The intensity of the immunoreactive bands was quantified by image analysis. The ratio of phosphorylated Ypk1/2 (p-Ypks) to that of total Ypk1 was normalized to that of the sample at 0 min set as one. Data are from three independent experiments (mean ± s.d.). j ORM1-TAP cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 15 min, and were then further grown for another 120 min after the addition of 1.25 µM AbA or 1.25 µM myriocin. A portion of the untreated control sample was treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Orm1-TAP was detected using PAP antibody.

The potent antitumor lipid edelfosine, a lysophosphatidylcholine analog, targets cellular membranes and alters microdomain organization and morphology through its affinity for sterols38–40. The inhibitory effect of edelfosine on Ypk1/2 phosphorylation was also observed when cells were treated with myriocin in addition to AbA and MG (Fig. 1d). Although high edelfosine concentrations (20 µg/ml = 38.2 µM) have been reported to exert cytotoxicity and consequently inhibit the cell growth of yeast39, AbA-induced Ypk1/2 phosphorylation was sufficiently abolished by treatment with 5 µM edelfosine that had little effect on cell growth (Fig. 1c–f). Since the activity of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling is necessary for AbA tolerance, we next examined the influence of edelfosine on AbA susceptibility. As shown in Fig. 1g, edelfosine-treated cells exhibited increased AbA susceptibility. A previous study on yeast screening for edelfosine-resisted mutants identified deletion mutants of retromer components (Vps29 and Vps35) involved in the retrograde transport of cargo proteins45. Neither the deletion of VPS29 nor VPS35 suppressed the inhibitory effect of edelfosine on Ypk1/2 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 1c), suggesting that the impaired Ypk1/2 phosphorylation is not due to the cytotoxicity of edelfosine. Meanwhile, incorporation of edelfosine into cells is mediated by a flippase and is impaired by the mutation of Lem3, a flippase subunit46. LEM3 deletion suppressed the inhibitory effect of edelfosine on Ypk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1h), indicating that edelfosine exerts its inhibitory effect on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling after incorporating into the cells. Besides sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibition, the mechanical stretch of PM provoked by hypo-osmotic shock induces transient activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, which is more clear and persistent in mutant of the aquaglyceroporin Fps16,12. As shown in Fig. 1i, edelfosine also inhibited the hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ypk1/2 phosphorylation in fps1∆ cells. Orm1 phosphorylation levels, a downstream effector of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, are increased following treatment with myriocin or AbA, and these phosphorylations are observed as a mobility shift of Orm1 bands in SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting19,21. An increase in the band shift of Orm1 corresponding to the phosphorylated Orm1 following treatment with myriocin or AbA was diminished in the presence of edelfosine (Fig. 1j). These data indicate that edelfosine inhibits TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling activation.

Edelfosine activates the CWI pathway

In addition to Ypk1/2, Pkc1, a component of the CWI pathway, has also been identified as a direct substrate of TORC2, and TORC2 regulates Pkc1 through its phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif (Ser1143), which is independent of the CWI pathway16,31 (Fig. 2a). To determine whether edelfosine inhibits TORC2-Pkc1 signaling, the levels of Pkc1 phosphorylation at Ser1143 were checked. Pkc1 phosphorylation levels in the steady state were highly kept, and edelfosine had no strong influence on it (Fig. 2b). Although edelfosine did not inhibit TORC2-Pkc1 signaling, we noticed that the phosphorylation levels of Mpk1 MAP kinase, a downstream effector of the CWI pathway, were enhanced following treatment with edelfosine in a Pkc1-dependent manner (Figs. 2b and 2c). Additionally, the edelfosine-induced Mpk1 phosphorylation was diminished by the deletion of WSC1 and MID2, which are major sensors of the CWI pathway localized at PM31,35 (Fig. 2d). These findings suggest that edelfosine does not inhibit the TORC2-Pkc1 signaling, but it does cause the CWI pathway activation in a Pkc1-dependent manner. The CWI pathway activation is induced by heat shock and cell wall stresses, such as treatments with cell wall-perturbing agents32–34. Calcofluor white (CFW) that binds to chitin in the yeast cell wall and interferes with normal wall assembly induces the CWI pathway activation through the membrane sensors, and consequently leads to an increase in Mpk1 phosphorylation33. The increased Mpk1 phosphorylation by treatment with cell wall-perturbing agents, including CFW, is attenuated by 1 M sorbitol for osmotic support33. The CFW-induced Mpk1 phosphorylation was abolished by culturing cells in 1 M sorbitol; however, it was not observed in the case of edelfosine treatment (Fig. 2e). Meanwhile, the edelfosine-induced Mpk1 phosphorylation was diminished in lem3∆ cells (Fig. 2f). These results suggest that edelfosine activates the CWI pathway by incorporating into PM rather than causing cell wall damage.Fig. 2 Edelfosine activates the CWI pathway.

a Conserved sites of Pkc1 in addition to Ypk1/2 are phosphorylated by TORC2. Although Pkc1 is a component of the CWI pathway, TORC2 regulates Pkc1 independently of the CWI pathway. b pkc1∆ (DL376)79 cells carrying an empty vector, YEp352-PKC1 (pFR22), or YEp352-PKC1S1143A (pFR74)80 were cultured in SD medium with 1 M sorbitol until the log phase of growth and treated with 5 µM edelfosine for 60 min. Phosphorylated Pkc1, Pkc1, phosphorylated Mpk1, or Mpk1 was detected with anti-phosphorylated Pkc1S1143, anti-Pkc1, anti-phosphorylated Mpk1, or anti-Mpk1 antibody, respectively; a band of Pkc1 is indicated by an arrowhead. c Wild-type (BY4741) cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and treated with 5 µM edelfosine for the prescribed times. Phosphorylated Mpk1, or Mpk1 was detected as described in (b). d Wild-type (BY4741), wsc1∆, mid2∆, and wsc1∆mid2∆ cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and treated with 5 µM edelfosine for 60 min. The phosphorylated Mpk1 or Mpk1 was detected as described in (b). e Wild-type (BY4741) cells were cultured in SD medium with or without 1 M sorbitol until the log phase of growth and treated with 5 µM edelfosine or 40 µg/ml CFW for 60 min. Phosphorylated Mpk1 or Mpk1 was detected as described in (b). f Wild-type (BY4741) and lem3∆ cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth, and the phosphorylation of Mpk1 induced by edelfosine was determined as described in (b).

Activation of the CWI pathway inhibits TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling

To determine whether the edelfosine-induced activation of the CWI pathway is involved in TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling inhibition, the inhibitory effect of edelfosine in mutants defective in the CWI pathway was examined. As shown in Fig. 3a, the inhibitory effect of edelfosine on Ypk1/2 phosphorylation was attenuated in wsc1∆mid2∆ cells. In the CWI pathway, Pkc1 is activated by physical interaction with a GTP-bound form of small GTPase Rho1 via its HR1 (homology region 1) and C1 (conserved region 1) domains31,47–49. Mutations of both the HR1 and C1 domains in order to interfere with the physical interaction between Rho1 and Pkc1, i.e., substitution of Leu54 with Ser in HR1 and four Cys residues with Ser in the C1 domain48,50, abolished the edelfosine-induced Mpk1 phosphorylation and attenuated the inhibitory effect of edelfosine on Ypk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3b). Conversely, no marked attenuation of the inhibitory effect of edelfosine was observed in mutants of the Mpk1 MAP kinase cascade components, Bck1 and Mpk1, which are downstream Pkc1 effectors (Fig. 3c). These results suggest that the CWI pathway activation induced by edelfosine inhibits TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling in a Mpk1 MAP kinase cascade-independent manner.Fig. 3 CWI pathway inhibits TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling.

a Wild-type (BY4741) and wsc1∆mid2∆ cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 15 min, and were further grown for another 60 min after the addition of 1.25 µM AbA. Phosphorylated Ypk1/2, Ypk1, phosphorylated Mpk1, or Mpk1 was detected with anti-phosphorylated Ypk1T662 and Ypk2T659, anti-Ypk1, anti-phosphorylated Mpk1, or anti-Mpk1 antibody, respectively. b PKC1 and PKC1L54S_4C/S cells were cultured in SD medium with 1 M sorbitol until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 15 min, and were then further grown for another 60 min after addition of 1.25 µM AbA. Phosphorylated Ypk1/2, Ypk1, phosphorylated Mpk1, or Mpk1 was detected as described in (a). c Wild-type (BY4741), bck1∆, and mpk1∆ cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 15 min, and were then further grown for another 60 min after the addition of 1.25 µM AbA. Phosphorylated Ypk1/2, Ypk1, phosphorylated Mpk1, or Mpk1 was detected as described in (a). d Wild-type (BY4741) cells carrying an empty vector, YCpLG-WSC1, or YCpLG-MID2 were cultured in raffinose medium until the log phase of growth, and galactose was added to the medium to a concentration of 2%. After incubation for 2 h, cells were treated with 1.25 µM AbA for 60 min. Phosphorylated Ypk1/2, Ypk1, phosphorylated Mpk1, or Mpk1 was detected as described in (a). The intensity of the immunoreactive bands was quantified by image analysis. The ratio of phosphorylated Ypk1/2 (p-Ypks) to that of total Ypk1 was normalized to that of the control sample with the empty vector set as one. Data are from three independent experiments (mean ± s.d.). e Wild-type (BY4741) cells carrying an empty vector, YCpLG-PKC1, or YCpLG-PKC1R398P 81,82 were cultured and treated with AbA as described in (d). The ratio of phosphorylated Ypk1/2 was determined as described in (d). Data are from three independent experiments (mean ± s.d.). ****p < 0.0001 (one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).

Next, we examined whether the CWI pathway activation is sufficient to inhibit TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling. An overexpression of WSC1 or MID2 activated the CWI pathway and then increased the Mpk1 phosphorylation levels, under which conditions the activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling was significantly repressed (Fig. 3d). Additionally, an overexpression of a GTP-locked Rho1 mutant (Rho1Q68L) or a constitutively active Pkc1 mutant (Pkc1R398P) also attenuated the AbA-induced Ypk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3e, and Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting that Pkc1 activation through the CWI pathway causes the inhibitory effect on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling.

Effect of activation of the CWI pathway on eisosome disassembly and Slm1 release from eisosomes

F-BAR- and PH-domain-containing proteins Slm1 and Slm2 play major roles in TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling activation, and especially in the recruitment of Ypk1 to PM, including MCTs6,9,22,51 (Fig. 4a). Under normal conditions, Slm1/2 preferentially localize at eisosomes, whereas the inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis reduces the ratio of their localization at eisosomes and increases their localization at MCTs6,9. Meanwhile, sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibition also promotes the disassembly of eisosome structures28–30. Although it is unclear whether the dynamics of eisosome structures are required for the activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, eisosome disassembly occurs simultaneously with the delocalization of Slm1/2 from eisosomes under inhibitory conditions of sphingolipid biosynthesis (Fig. 4a). A previous study of phosphoproteomic analysis has indicated that overexpression of an active PKC1 mutant influences the phosphorylation status of some eisosome components, including a core components Pil1 and Lsp1, and the phosphorylation of Pil1 is involved in eisosome assembly52. These observations suggest the possibility that eisosomes participate in the inhibitory effect through the CWI pathway on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling. To confirm this possibility, we examined whether edelfosine affects the eisosome using microscopy with mCherry-tagged Sur7, a transmembrane component of eisosome27, as an eisosome marker. Under normal conditions, Sur7-mCherry patches at the PM were clearly observed as previously reported27,53 (Fig. 4b). To determine the degree of eisosome assembly, the relative fluorescence of Sur7-mCherry was measured along the PM. The clarity of patchy localization of Sur7-mCherry, indicated by peaks, was decreased, and its diffusion throughout the PM was enhanced following treatment with AbA, i.e., eisosome disassembly was enhanced. AbA-induced diffusion of Sur7-mCherry was blocked in the presence of edelfosine (Fig. 4b), and furthermore the blockage of Sur7-mCherry diffusion was also verified by the overexpression of WSC1 or MID2 (Fig. 4c). The effect of edelfosine on eisosome disassembly was also verified using Lsp1-mCherry (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Meanwhile, TORC2 localization, which forms a punctate pattern beneath the PM, was not markedly altered following treatment with edelfosine (Supplementary Fig. 3b). These results suggest that the CWI pathway blocks eisosome disassembly induced by the inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis.Fig. 4 CWI pathway blocks eisosome disassembly and Slm1 release from eisosome.

a PM stress induces eisosome disassembly and the release of Slm1/2, which are eisosome-localized proteins necessary for activating TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, from eisosome. b SUR7-mCherry cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 15 min, and were then further grown for another 60 min after addition of 1.25 µM AbA. Sur7-mCherry was observed using a fluorescence microscope. The graphs show the fluorescence intensity profiles of Sur7-mCherry from the line scan (yellow line on midsection images of cells indicated by asterisks) along the PM.

Based on findings that Slm1/2 are released from eisosomes following sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibition6,24, we hypothesized that the CWI pathway activation also blocked the release of Slm1/2 from eisosomes, which is required for Ypk1/2 phosphorylation by TORC2, in addition to eisosome disassembly. To test this hypothesis, we next examined whether edelfosine blocks the release of Slm1 from eisosomes following treatment with AbA. Slm1-GFP and Sur7-mCherry were mainly observed as patches at PM, most of which were colocalized, and an overlap of the fluorescence signals was detected (Fig. 4d). Treatment with AbA decreased and diffused Sur7-mCherry patches, resulting in less overlap between Slm1-GFP and Sur7-mCherry patches, and this AbA-induced reduction of overlap was suppressed by edelfosine (Fig. 4d). The reduction in the colocalization of Slm1-GFP and Sur7-mCherry indicating Slm1 release from eisosomes following treatment with AbA was also observed in the cortical view, and edelfosine suppressed the AbA-induced reduction in the colocalization (Fig. 4e). Additionally, Slm1-GFP and Sur7-mCherry colocalization was enhanced under the presence of edelfosine (Fig. 4e). These edelfosine effects on Slm1-GFP and Sur7-mCherry colocalization were also observed in the case of the overexpression of PKC1R398P, a constitutively active mutant of Pkc1 (Fig. 4f). These data suggested that the CWI pathway activation simultaneously blocked eisosome disassembly and Slm1 release from eisosomes, which were caused by sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibition.

Eisosome structures are necessary for the inhibitory effect of the CWI pathway on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling

If blockage of eisosome disassembly and Slm1 release from eisosomes are responsible for the inhibitory effect on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, the inhibitory effect would be exerted via eisosomes. We then examined whether the inhibitory effect through the CWI pathway on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling depends on eisosome structures using a pil1∆lsp1∆ mutant, in which typical eisosomes disappear and instead a few large clusters, called eisosome remnants, emerge27. As shown in Fig. 5a, although the increased Ypk1/2 phosphorylation levels induced by AbA in pil1∆lsp1∆ cells were comparable with those in wild-type cells, the inhibitory effect of edelfosine on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling activation was markedly attenuated in pil1∆lsp1∆ cells. The inhibitory effect of MID2 overexpression was also attenuated in pil1∆lsp1∆ cells (Fig. 5b). Additionally, treatment with edelfosine increased AbA susceptibility (Fig. 1g), which was suppressed by deletion of PIL1 and LSP1 (Fig. 5c). These results suggest that eisosome structures are necessary to exert the inhibitory effects through the CWI pathway on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling.Fig. 5 Involvement of eisosome structures in the inhibitory effect of the CWI pathway on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling.

After incubation for 2 h, cells were treated with 1.25 µM AbA for 60 min. The phosphorylated Ypk1/2, Ypk1, phosphorylated Mpk1, or Mpk1 was detected as described in Fig. 3a. The intensity of the immunoreactive bands was quantified by image analysis. The ratio of phosphorylated Ypk1/2 (p-Ypks) to total Ypk1 was normalized to that of the control sample of wild-type cells carrying an empty vector set as one. Data are from four independent experiments (mean ± s.d.). c Wild-type (BY4741), pil1∆, and pil1∆lsp1∆ cells were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and treated with 5 µM edelfosine for 60 min, and then were spotted in 5-fold serial dilution onto SD agar plates with 0.03 µM AbA. The plates were scanned after incubation for 3 days at 28 °C. d pil1∆ cells carrying an empty vector pRS416-PIL1-13myc or pRS416-PIL1S230A/T233A-13myc were cultured in SD medium until the log phase of growth and pretreated with 5 µM edelfosine for 15 min, were then further grown for another 60 min after addition of 1.25 µM AbA.

Pil1 is known to be phosphorylated at multiple sites28,29,52, in which phosphorylations at Ser230 and Thr233 are induced by Pkc1 signaling and contribute to eisosome assembly52. Pkc1 does not directly phosphorylates at Ser230 and Thr233 of Pil1, but is involved in these phosphorylations through Mpk152. We determine whether Pil1 phosphorylations at Ser230 and Thr233 are involved in the inhibitory effect on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling activation. The inhibitory effect of edelfosine was also sufficiently attenuated by PIL1 deletion, and this attenuation of the inhibitory effect in pil1∆ cells was reverted by introducing wild-type PIL1 and PIL1S230A/T233A, a mutant of Ala substitutions of Ser230 and Thr233 (Fig. 5d). This result indicated that the phosphorylation status of Pil1 at Ser230 and Thr233, which are targeted by Mpk1, is not involved in the inhibitory effect through the CWI pathway on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, consistent with the result that the inhibitory effect of edelfosine was independent of the Mpk1 MAP kinase cascade (Fig. 3c).

The inhibitory effect through the CWI pathway on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling contributes to the cell wall stress response

The CWI pathway is activated in response to cell wall damage in order to maintain cell wall integrity. To determine whether the inhibitory effect through the CWI pathway on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling is exerted under cell wall-damaged conditions, the effect of the cell wall-perturbing agent CFW on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling activation was examined. Pretreatment with CFW led to enhanced Mpk1 phosphorylation, indicating activation of the CWI pathway, and a decrease in the AbA-induced Ypk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6a), suggesting that cell wall damage causes the inhibitory effect on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling. The inhibitory effect induced by CFW treatment was attenuated in pil1∆ cells (Fig. 6b), as was the case with edelfosine treatment or MID2 overexpression. We next examined whether the inhibitory effect through the CWI pathway on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling is involved in an adaptive response to cell wall stress. If the inhibitory effect is important for the adaptive response to CFW, then pil1∆ cells would be expected to exhibit sensitivity to CFW. As shown in Fig. 6c, PIL1 deletion increased CFW sensitivity, which was more pronounced at 35°C than at 28°C. Additionally, overexpression of YPK1D242A, the constitutively active mutant allele of YPK119, also increased CFW sensitivity in wild-type cells (Fig. 6d). These results suggest that the downregulation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling is involved in the proper adaptive response to CFW.Fig. 6 The effect of cell wall stress on the inhibitory effect on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling.

The yeast cell wall primarily comprises β-1,3-glucan, β-1,6-glucan, chitin, and mannoproteins, which are assembled into an extracellular matrix to maintain cell integrity, and is remodeled during cell growth by elongation and branching of newly synthesized polysaccharides. β-1,3-glucan is the most abundant cell wall component. GAS1 encodes a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein with β-1,3-glucanosyltransferase activity that mediates the elongation and branching of β-1,3-glucan54. The gas1∆ cells have been shown to exhibit a decrease in β-1,3-glucan levels and weakened cell wall phenotypes, such as a hypersensitivity to cell wall-perturbing agents55,56, and the CWI pathway is constitutively activated by GAS1 deletion-induced cell wall defects33. Lastly, we examined whether the inhibitory effect on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling is exerted in gas1∆ cells with a constitutively activated state of the CWI pathway. GAS1 deletion increased the Mpk1 phosphorylation levels, indicating the activation of the CWI pathway, and attenuated the AbA-induced Ypk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6e). Additionally, the overexpression of YPK1D242A led to growth defects in gas1∆ cells under unstressed conditions (Fig. 6f). These results suggest that the downregulation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling is required for growth of gas1∆ cells, where the CWI pathway is constitutively activated.

Discussion

TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling senses PM dynamics and contributes to the maintenance of PM integrity13,19,20,22,23. Here, we identified a mechanism for the negative regulation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling by the CWI pathway based on analysis using the lysophosphatidylcholine analog edelfosine. Edelfosine strongly inhibited TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling without increasing mortality (Fig. 1), and edelfosine incorporated into PM caused CWI pathway activation without inducing cell wall damage (Fig. 2), which was involved in its inhibitory effect on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling (Fig. 3a,b). Edelfosine is known to alter PM microdomain organization and morphology38–40. It has been reported that sensors for CWI pathway, Wsc1 and Mid2, form specific microdomains at PM, and the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of Wsc1 contributes to its microdomain formation and signaling function57. Whether the formation of the sensor’s microdomains triggers the CWI pathway is unclear, but edelfosine may be involved in the CWI pathway activation by altering those microdomains. TORC2 also resides in the MCT microdomain at PM, and its localization at PM is considered to be necessary to phosphorylate Ypk1/2 localized at PM via interaction with Slm1/2. Edelfosine did not disrupt the punctate pattern of MCT at PM (Supplementary Fig. 3b), and did not reduce the phosphorylation levels of Pkc1 at Ser1143 at Pkc1, another TORC2 target (Fig. 2b). Therefore, it was thought that the inhibitory effect of edelfosine on TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling was unattributable to its influence on TORC2 itself.

The CWI pathway inhibited the activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling induced by membrane stress (Fig. 3) and simultaneously blocked eisosome disassembly and Slm1 release from eisosomes (Fig. 4). Since the inhibitory effect required eisosome structures (Fig. 5), we considered that the CWI pathway-induced inhibition of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling was exerted through the blockage of eisosome disassembly and Slm1 release. It has been reported that Slm1 has multiple phosphorylation sites, and that Slm1 phosphorylation is modulated by TORC2 or kinases regulated by phytosphingosine25,58,59. Slm1 is dephosphorylated following treatment with myriocin or AbA21,59, and the dephosphorylation of Slm1 correlates with the phosphorylation of Ypk1, implying a relationship between the dephosphorylation of Slm1 and the activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling21. Edelfosine treatment enhanced the dephosphorylation of Slm1 as well as AbA treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that at least the dephosphorylation of Slm1 may not be involved in the release of Slm1 from eisosomes. Pkc1 in the CWI pathway was indispensable for the inhibitory effect on eisosome disassembly and Slm1 release, but the Mpk1 MAP kinase cascade was dispensable. Pkc1 has been reported to contribute to eisosome rearrangement under glucose starvation to promote the formation of stress granules, and eisosome rearrangement is controlled by Pil1 phosphorylations to which Pkc1 commits in an Mpk1-independent manner60. Ser230 of Pil1 has been shown to be the responsible phosphorylation site involved in the eisosome rearrangement regulated by Pkc1 under glucose starvation60. Previous phosphoproteomic analyses have indicated that Mpk1 also targets Ser230 and Thr233 of Pil152, and thus, Pil1 phosphorylation at Ser230 seems to be regulated by both Pkc1 and Mpk1. However, our results showed that the CWI pathway-induced inhibition of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling was unaffected by Pil1 mutation at Ser230 (Fig. 5d), suggesting that the effect of Pkc1 signaling on the phosphorylation levels of Pil1 at Ser230 was not involved in the blockage of eisosome disassembly. Pil1 is known to possess multiple phosphorylation sites26, and therefore Pkc1 may block eisosome disassembly by regulating the phosphorylation levels of other sites in Pil1. Meanwhile, it has been reported that TORC2 phosphorylates some sites in the C-terminal region of Ypk1 in addition to the turn motif (Ser644) and hydrophobic motif (Thr662)41, and the phosphorylation levels of these Ypk1 sites targeted by TORC2 other than Ser644 and Thr662 have been shown to be downregulated by Mpk161. It has been suggested that this attenuation is due to Mpk1-mediated phosphorylation of Avo2, a TORC2 component, which promotes the dissociation of Avo2 from TORC261. However, whether this Mpk1-dependent regulation affects the phosphorylation levels of Ypk1 at Thr662 has not been demonstrated61. Therefore, several TORC2-targeted phosphorylation sites of Ypk1 may be affected by Pkc1 signaling through different regulatory machinery that are either Mpk1-dependent or Mpk1-independent.

Our results show that the colocalization of Slm1 and eiosomes is enhanced by Pkc1 activation (Fig. 4e, f), suggesting that Pkc1 regulates the accumulation of Slm1 at eisosomes. The localization of Slm1 to PM requires its PH-domain that binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2, and physical interactions between Slm1 and TORC2 components, Avo2 and Bit61, are thought to be involved in its localization to MCTs on PM62. On the other hand, the accumulation of Slm1 at eisosomes is thought to involve its PH-domain and F-BAR domain that binds to membrane curvature26, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to contribute to eisosome formation in addition to the accumulation of Slm1 at eisosomes26,63,64. Additionally, PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been also reported to be involved in negative regulation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling through a formation of PESs triggered by a decrease in plasma membrane tension12. We previously showed that activation of Pkc1 signaling by expression of PKC1R398P does not significantly change the cellular levels of PtdIns(4,5)P265. Additionally, in microscopic analysis of the subcellular distribution of PtdIns(4,5)P2 using GFP-2xPHPLCδ66, an enrichment of GFP-2xPHPLCδ at eisosomes and the PES formation were not observed in PKC1R398P-expressing cells (our unpublished data). It is unlikely that an influence on the PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics in PM is responsible for Slm1 accumulation at eisosomes by Pkc1, which is activated by the CWI pathway.

PM integrity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and cell growth. Lipids constituting eukaryotic PMs are primarily glycerophospholipids, sterols, and sphingolipids, and their levels change during cell growth and adaptation to environmental stresses, contributing to the maintenance of PM integrity67,68. The cell wall is constantly synthesized, remodeled, and degraded to maintain cell wall integrity under various extracellular conditions and environmental stresses69. During yeast cell growth, the synthesis and remodeling of the cell wall and the extension of the PM must be associated with an increase in cell volume, i.e., there should be a close relationship between cell wall integrity and PM integrity. In this study, we demonstrated that the CWI pathway contributing to cell wall integrity negatively regulated TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling, which controls sphingolipid biosynthesis (Fig. 6g). Constitutive activation of Ypk1 signaling by expression of the active mutant YPK1D242A increased CFW sensitivity and caused a marked growth defect in gas1∆ cells (Fig. 6d, f). It has also been reported that expression of the active mutant YPK2D239A causes growth inhibition on agar plates containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which induces plasma membrane and/or cell wall perturbation with activation of the CWI pathway70. These results may be due to the retention of high activity of Ypk1/2 signaling under conditions of cell wall damage, thereby upsetting the balance in relationship between cell wall integrity and PM integrity, which ensure the proper stress response and cell growth. Therefore, it is likely that the negative regulation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling through the CWI pathway found in this study accounts for the regulation of this relationship.

Sphingolipid biosynthesis in yeast is carried out using ceramides, sphingolipid precursors, formed from very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and sphingoid long-chain bases (LCBs), which are synthesized from two branched pathways71. The CWI pathway has been suggested to regulate VLCFA synthesis; a signaling pathway controlled by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho1, Rom2, negatively regulates the fatty acid elongation cycle via the phosphorylation of Elo2, fatty acid elongase72. Since the TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling controls the synthesis of LCBs and ceramides through regulating serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase18–21, our findings suggest that the CWI pathway negatively regulates sphingolipid biosynthesis by affecting multiple steps during ceramide synthesis through different mechanisms. Pkc1 has also been reported to target some proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism, including Pah1 (phosphatidate phosphatase)73, Ura7 (CTP synthase)74, and Opi1 (transcriptional repressor)75. The CWI pathway may control phospholipid metabolism in addition to sphingolipid metabolism through Pkc1 signaling, and this control of lipid metabolisms may contribute to the adaptive response to cell wall stress.

The cells were cultured until an A610 of 0.3–0.5 was obtained. Cells harvested by centrifugation were resuspended in 200 µl of 20% trichloroacetic acid with glass beads and disrupted using Micro Smash MS-100 (TOMY, Tokyo, Japan). Supernatants were obtained, and glass beads were rinsed with 400 µl of 5% trichloroacetic acid (sample’s final concentration of trichloroacetic acid was 10%), and then the samples were incubated for another 15 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min, and pellets were rinsed using ice-cold acetone. Following centrifugation, pellets were dried and resuspended using 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The total protein concentration was determined using the RC DCTM Protein Assay (#5000122; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Dr. Tatsuya Maeda of Hamamatsu University School of Medicine kindly donated the anti-phosphorylated Ypk1T662/Ypk2T659 (1:25,000)21, anti-Ypk1 (1:3000, sc12054; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (1:5000, #9101; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-Mpk1 (1:3,000, sc6803; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Pgk1 (1:10,000, #A6457; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), anti-phosphorylated Pkc1S1143 (1:3000)16, and anti-Pkc1 (1:2000)16, were used as primary antibodies. The Orm1-TAP was detected using peroxidase anti-peroxidase soluble complex (PAP) antibody (1:8,000, P1291; Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using Immobilon Western chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore) using a Fuji Las 4000 Mini System (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Size markers were estimated using digitized image of pre-stained protein markers transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The intensity of the immunoreactive bands was quantified using ImageJ.

Spot assay

Cells were cultured in SD medium until the early log phase of growth and then diluted to an A610 value of 0.1 using sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution. The cells were serially diluted (1:5) with sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution, and aliquots (5 µL) were spotted onto SD agar plates.

Microscopy

Microscopic analysis using a micro slide glass was conducted using a BX63 fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an ORCA-Fusion digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan). To analyze the fluorescence intensity profiles of Sur7-mCherry and Slm1-GFP, each fluorescence intensity along the PM on midsection images was calculated using cellSens software (OLYMPUS). The colocalization of Sur7-mCherry and Slm1-GFP was analyzed using the cellSens software with microscopic images of the cell surface and is represented by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

Statistics and reproducibility

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Sample sizes are indicated in the figure legends. Data are presented as mean and standard deviation. The statistical significance of differences was assessed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.
