pmcIntroduction and background

The relationship between diet and oral health has long been a subject of interest in scientific research and public health discourse [1,2]. Among the various components of the diet, sugar alcohols, also known as polyols, have emerged as notable alternatives to traditional sugars due to their reduced calorie content and minimal impact on blood glucose levels [3,4]. With their ability to provide sweetness without the same caloric impact and potential dental harm as regular sugars, sugar alcohols are often seen as a healthier option [5]. Consequently, they have become increasingly popular as sweetening agents in a broad array of food and beverage items [6,7], including sugar-free gums [8,9], candies [10], and oral care products [11].

Sugar alcohols are carbohydrate molecules resembling sugars and alcohols, derived by replacing hydrogen atoms in sugar molecules with hydroxyl (OH) groups. Unlike ethanol, a type of alcohol, sugar alcohols have multiple hydroxyl groups attached to their carbon backbone [12]. They are classified into natural, synthetic, and naturally occurring types. Natural sugar alcohols like xylitol, erythritol, and sorbitol are found in fruits and vegetables or produced through fermentation or hydrogenation. Synthetic sugar alcohols, such as isomalt, maltitol, and lactitol, are derived from sugar sources through chemical processes. Mannitol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol in algae and certain fruits [13-15]. Sugar alcohols undergo fermentation by gut bacteria, leading to slower increases in blood sugar levels than sugars. While excessive consumption can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, they are generally considered safe [12]. Sugar alcohols and alcohols like ethanol serve different purposes and have different properties and metabolic pathways despite both containing alcohol functional groups [12,16].

Understanding the effects of sugar alcohol consumption on oral health is of paramount importance, considering the prevalence of dental caries and other oral health issues globally [17-20]. At the same time, sugar alcohols are generally considered safer for dental health than conventional sugars. Their potential impacts on oral microbiota, dental plaque formation, and oral health warrant comprehensive investigation. A bibliometric analysis offers a systematic and quantitative approach to exploring the existing literature on this subject, providing insights into research trends, key contributors, collaboration patterns, and emerging areas of interest. By synthesizing and analyzing a wide array of scholarly publications, a bibliometric study can offer valuable perspectives on the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of sugar alcohol consumption on oral health.

In this study, we aim to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and research gaps concerning sugar and alcohol consumption and its impact on oral health. Expressly, we have set out the following objectives: firstly, to identify and scrutinize the volume and temporal distribution of scholarly publications on sugar alcohol consumption and oral health; secondly, to assess the geographical dispersion of research output and pinpoint leading countries and institutions in this domain; thirdly, to delve into the thematic focus of research articles, examining the specific sugar alcohols studied, oral health outcomes assessed, and methodologies employed; fourthly, to identify influential authors, journals, and research networks that are shaping the discourse on sugar alcohol consumption and oral health; finally, to discuss the implications of existing research findings and identify potential avenues for future investigation and intervention. Through this bibliometric analysis, we aspire to contribute to a deeper understanding of the research landscape concerning the effect of sugar and alcohol consumption on oral health, with significant implications for public health policy and dietary recommendations.

Materials and methods

Search Strategy and Study Selection

On April 28, 2024, a systematic online search was conducted on PubMed to retrieve relevant literature on sugar alcohol consumption and its effects on oral health. The following search string was used: ("sugar alcohol" OR "Sorbitan" OR "lycasin" OR "glycerol" OR "polyol" OR "Xylitol" OR "sorbitol" OR "mannitol" OR "erythritol" OR "maltitol" OR "isomalt" OR "lactitol" OR "hydrogenated starch hydrolysates" OR "polyglycerol" OR "arabitol") AND ("oral health" OR "Oral tissue" OR "Dental health" OR "Saliva" OR "Dental caries" OR "Xerostomia" OR "Periodont*" OR "Oral microbiome") NOT ("Animals" OR "Ethanol").

Specifically, we considered clinical trials published in English that investigate the consumption of sugar alcohol and its effects on oral health outcomes for inclusion in our study. Studies published in languages other than English are excluded from this analysis. Additionally, animal studies are not considered. We excluded studies that solely focus on the consumption of alcohol or other sugars (e.g., sucrose, fructose, and glucose) without specific mention or analysis of sugar alcohols. Review articles lacking original research data are also excluded. Duplicate publications or studies with overlapping data are also excluded to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the analysis.

Filters available in PubMed were applied to ensure the selection of clinical trials. The data from selected articles were exported to a text file format for further analysis using bibliometric software tools, specifically VOSviewer (developed by Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman, Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University) and Biblioshiny (Bibliometrix, developed by Massimo Aria and Corrado Cuccurullo). Subsequently, titles and abstracts of all retrieved articles were manually inspected to assess data reliability. The study selection process was illustrated in a flowchart generated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [21].

Data Analysis

Biblioshiny (Rstudio 4.3.1 (Posit PBC, Boston, MA)) was used to extract key information from each article, including publication details (e.g., title, authors, and journal), study characteristics, and main findings. In addition, analysis and visualization of leading contributors and topic trends were also performed [22]. VOSviewer (version 1.6.20) was employed to visualize co-authorship networks and keyword cooccurrence analysis [23]. Microsoft Excel (MicrosoftÂ® Corp., Redmond, WA) was used to visualize the data from the analysis conducted using Biblioshiny software. Biorender (BioRender, Toronto, Canada) [24], a graphic design tool, was utilized to create visual representations of the key findings derived from the bibliometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the findings of the bibliometric analysis. Multiple researchers were involved in the study selection process and data extraction to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data analysis. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus among the research team members.

This bibliometric analysis involved the use of publicly available data from published clinical trials, and no human subjects were directly involved. Therefore, ethical approval was not required for this study. The findings of this bibliometric analysis were compiled into a comprehensive report, presenting graphical representations and interpretive insights to facilitate understanding and dissemination of the results, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in this critical area of healthcare.

Results

Search Results

A total of 1,223 publications were identified in the initial search. Among these publications, 1,108 were published in the English language. This subset of English publications includes various studies and documents, including 267 clinical trials, 127 reviews, three case reports, 21 comments, six observational studies, one editorial, and three books or documents. We conducted a thorough manual inspection to ensure the comprehensive inclusion of relevant clinical trials. This meticulous process confirmed the inclusion of 267 clinical trials published in English for further analysis. This selection process and the resulting inclusion of clinical trials in the analysis are illustrated in Figure 1.

Discussion

The publication trend of clinical trials on sugar alcohol consumption and oral health fluctuated over the years, with minimal activity in the late 1960s to early 1970s, a gradual increase from 1975 onward, notable upticks in the 1990s and early 2000s, peaking in 2014 with 16 trials, followed by a decline between 2014 and 2016, yet showing sustained interest with moderate to high numbers of trials in recent years. The fluctuating pattern in the annual publication of clinical trials on sugar alcohol and oral health suggests a dynamic research landscape influenced by various factors. These include shifts in research interest and funding availability, technological advancements enabling more nuanced studies, changes in regulatory policies or guidelines, evolving consumer behaviors toward sugar-free products, and collaborative efforts between researchers and international initiatives. Peaks in publication rates may coincide with increased awareness of oral health issues, emerging evidence on sugar alcohol effects, or changes in consumer preferences. Understanding these factors can guide future research priorities and interventions promoting oral health and well-being.

Acta Odontologica Scandinavica, Clinical Oral Investigations, and the Journal of Clinical Periodontology follow closely.

The examination of country-wise scientific production indicates Italy as the frontrunner, with 76 trials, closely trailed by the United States with 56 trials. Noteworthy contributions are also observed from Finland, Germany, Canada, and several other countries, each demonstrating varying levels of engagement in clinical trial publications. Interestingly, while some countries exhibit steady growth in publication output over time, others demonstrate sporadic increases or sudden surges, indicating the diverse trajectories of research activity across different nations.

In a cooccurrence analysis of keywords, the subject-specific terms that stand out prominently due to their high TLS value are xylitol, dental caries, chewing gum, Streptococcus mutans, and saliva. Specifically, this suggests an investigation into the effects of xylitol, a sugar substitute commonly found in chewing gum, on salivation and prevention of dental caries caused by Streptococcus mutans. Our literature search also confirms these findings [25-28].

The collective analysis of the keyword clusters reveals a multifaceted exploration into the relationship between sugar alcohols and oral health across different age groups and conditions. These clusters encompass clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and investigations into preventive measures and treatments for oral health issues such as dental caries and periodontal diseases. Various methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and prospective studies, are employed to assess the efficacy and safety of sugar-alcohol-based interventions. Moreover, there's a focus on understanding the microbial dynamics in the oral environment, with attention to specific microorganisms and their interactions with sugar alcohols. The research aims to provide insights into the potential benefits or risks of sugar alcohol consumption for oral health and elucidate mechanisms underlying their effects on oral microbiota and dental outcomes. Analysis of topic trends suggests that there is a consistent exploration of sorbitol and xylitol alongside a growing interest in xylitol's potential benefits, a focus on cariostatic agents and dental caries prevention, and emerging research areas, such as probiotics and erythritol, reflecting the dynamic nature of oral health research priorities and advancements. Our literature search identified several publications on probiotics, erythritol, and microbiome, confirming the findings of the keyword analysis [29-34]. Research suggests that erythritol could be a favorable substitute for sugar in healthy individuals and those with diabetes, as it does not impact glucose or insulin levels [35]. Furthermore, both erythritol and xylitol, given alone or combined, effectively suppress the growth of Streptococcus mutans and Scardovia wiggsiae's clinical strains while significantly inhibiting biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans [36].

This study represents a pioneering endeavor in conducting an extensive bibliometric analysis of clinical trials investigating the impact of sugar alcohol on oral health. No comparable analysis has been undertaken in this field, highlighting the originality and importance of this research initiative. This bibliometric analysis provides valuable insights into the distribution of clinical trial publications on sugar alcohol and oral health, highlighting the pivotal role of crucial authors, institutions, journals, and countries in shaping the research landscape.

Although this bibliometric analysis offers valuable insights into the research landscape concerning the influence of sugar alcohol on oral health, it is crucial to acknowledge several limitations. One such limitation is inherent in the selection of databases, with this analysis relying solely on PubMed data. Since PubMed predominantly indexes biomedical literature, it may not fully capture research from other relevant disciplines, potentially skewing the representation of research trends and thematic clusters, mainly if any study is published in a non-PubMed indexed journal. Moreover, while bibliometric analysis sheds light on publication trends, collaboration networks, and geographical distribution of research output, it does not directly evaluate the quality or impact of individual studies. Merely assessing publication quantity might not accurately gauge the significance or rigor of research in this domain. Additionally, due to the extensive number of research papers, individual paper quality was not evaluated for bias, and the inclusion of only English articles may introduce language bias.

Future study recommendations

While this analysis suggests a breadth of research areas already addressed in the study of sugar alcohol and oral health, there are opportunities for future investigations to enrich our understanding of this complex relationship further. One recommendation is to conduct longitudinal studies spanning various age groups to assess the long-term effects of sugar alcohol consumption on oral health outcomes, including dental caries and periodontal conditions. Additionally, integrating qualitative research methods, such as interviews or focus groups, can provide valuable insights into individuals' perceptions and behaviors of sugar alcohol consumption and oral hygiene practices. Furthermore, exploring novel intervention strategies, such as personalized oral health promotion programs tailored to individuals' dietary habits and sugar and alcohol intake, could offer promising avenues for improving oral health outcomes. Lastly, interdisciplinary research approaches that combine microbiological, behavioral, and clinical perspectives may provide a more holistic understanding of how sugar alcohols impact oral microbiota and overall dental health. By addressing these recommendations, future studies can advance our knowledge and inform evidence-based practices for promoting oral health in diverse populations.
