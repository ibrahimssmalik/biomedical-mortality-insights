The Escherichia coli species is comprised of several ‘ecotypes’ inhabiting a wide range of host and natural environmental niches. Recent studies have suggested that novel naturalized ecotypes have emerged across wastewater treatment plants and meat processing facilities. Phylogenetic and multilocus sequence typing analyses clustered naturalized wastewater and meat plant E. coli strains into two main monophyletic clusters corresponding to the ST635 and ST399 sequence types, with several serotypes identified by serotyping, potentially representing distinct lineages that have naturalized across wastewater treatment plants and meat processing facilities. This evidence, taken alongside ecotype prediction analyses that distinguished the naturalized strains from their host-associated counterparts, suggests these strains may collectively represent a novel ecotype that has recently emerged across food- and water-associated engineered environments. Interestingly, pan-genomic analyses revealed that the naturalized strains exhibited an abundance of biofilm formation, defense, and disinfection-related stress resistance genes, but lacked various virulence and colonization genes, indicating that their naturalization has come at the cost of fitness in the original host environment.

Escherichia coli is widely recognized as an incredibly diverse species, consisting of a wide range of distinct ‘ecotypes’ that each occupy a specific ecological niche1. While E. coli typically exists as a benign resident in the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract2, select strains have acquired the ability to cause a myriad of intestinal and extraintestinal diseases in human and animal hosts3,4. Regardless of its status as a harmless commensal or dangerous pathogen, however, E. coli is generally understood to be a host-associated microbe. Indeed, the close association between E. coli and its various hosts underscores its use as a prominent fecal indicator bacterium, especially for microbial water quality assessment and fecal source tracking purposes5. Despite this, growing evidence points to the existence of distinct ‘naturalized’ populations that have evolved to survive, persist, and even grow in various non-host, natural environments including soil, sediments, and water6.

Several studies have differentiated these naturalized populations from their host-associated counterparts, suggesting they represent distinct, environmentally adapted E. coli ecotypes. For instance, when compared to host-derived strains naturalized E. coli isolated from soil7,8 and river water9,10 exhibited unique DNA fingerprints based on horizontal fluorophore-enhanced rep-PCR. Similarly, using an accessory gene fingerprinting approach, Tymensen et al.11 were able to differentiate naturalized surface water and sediment isolates from enteric strains based on the presence of characteristic combinations of ﻿iron acquisition, complement resistance, and biofilm formation genes. These naturalized populations have also been found to display various phenotypic adaptations reflective of their external, non-host niches. For example, naturalized E. coli strains linked with coliform blooms in Australian lakes were found to produce a group 1 capsule, providing enhanced resistance against environmental stressors such as UV radiation and desiccation12. Furthermore, E. coli strains isolated from temperate and subtropical soils in the United States have been shown to survive long periods of up to 1–2 months at lower temperatures ranging between 4 and 25 °C7,13.

Recent evidence suggests that the niche range of E. coli may even extend beyond natural environments. Reflecting this, a series of studies conducted by Zhi et al.14–16 have described distinct naturalized E. coli strains residing in wastewater matrices as a primary niche. Using a novel logic regression-based approach17 to intergenic DNA sequence analysis, up to 82% of wastewater E. coli isolates were characterized by specific patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms that were not found in any of their human and animal-derived counterparts14. Interestingly, a subset of these wastewater strains also harbored a unique uspC–IS30–flhDC genetic locus that, at the time, was found to be wastewater-specific14,16,18. Reflecting their distinct ecology, the naturalized strains carried an abundance of stress resistance genes, including the transmissible locus of stress tolerance (tLST), that appeared to confer resistance to the extreme stressors (i.e., disinfection) encountered during wastewater treatment16. Indeed, when compared to enteric strains, the naturalized wastewater strains displayed an enhanced capacity for biofilm formation15, and were found to be resistant to various disinfection-related stressors, including extreme heat, chlorine, and advanced oxidants19.

The distinct genotypic, phenotypic, and ecotypic characteristics of these wastewater strains were originally thought to reflect the emergence of a novel, wastewater-specific E. coli ecotype that evolved in response to the development of wastewater treatment and sanitation practices1,16. Recently, however, Yang et al.20 isolated E. coli strains from a meat processing plant exhibiting the wastewater-associated uspC–IS30–flhDC locus and tLST, suggesting that additional E. coli populations have become naturalized in other engineered environments. Thus, it is unclear whether these wastewater and meat plant E. coli strains represent distinct niche-specific ecotypes or reflect, more broadly, a general naturalized E. coli ecotype dispersed across various food- and water-associated built environments. Herein, we demonstrate that these E. coli populations can be phylogenetically and ecotypically distinguished from their host-associated counterparts, though they do not appear to represent separate ecotypic groups. Despite this, these wastewater and meat plant groups still harbor specific genetic features reflective of their respective niches, many of which can be linked to resistance against stressors including DNA damaging stimuli (e.g., UV), oxidative stress, heavy metals, and heat shock. Importantly, although these naturalized populations do not appear to be host-associated, their characterization raises the concerning prospect that microbes may be evolving resistance to disinfection.

Results

Phylogeny and typing of naturalized wastewater and meat plant E. coli strains

Alongside a lone naturalized wastewater strain (SZ4) that was isolated and sequenced separately, the genome sequences of 19 naturalized wastewater and 17 naturalized meat plant E. coli strains were screened and downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database (see Supplementary Table S1 online). Of these, 16 wastewater strains and 11 meat plant strains were found to harbor the uspC–IS30–flhDC locus. To assess whether the naturalization of the wastewater and meat plant strains within their respective engineered niches could be reflected in phylogeny, a core-genome phylogenetic analysis was performed. A phylogenetic tree was generated using the maximum likelihood algorithm with the 37 naturalized strains alongside 45 representative E. coli strains across lifestyles (i.e., commensal, intestinal pathogenic [InPEC], extraintestinal pathogenic [ExPEC], environmental) and phylogroups, 5 genus Escherichia (i.e., non-E. coli) strains across the cryptic clades21, and an Escherichia albertii strain as the outgroup. All naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains were found to cluster within phylogroup A (Fig. 1), with most grouping within a monophyletic clade separate from their host-associated counterparts. Aside from the wastewater strains SZ4 and WW38, which grouped closest to the InPEC strains ETEC_H101407 and 53,638 respectively, the rest of the wastewater and meat plant strains formed a separate cluster that was largely exclusive to the naturalized strains except for the inclusion of Fec6, a presumptive human commensal isolate recovered from a fecal swab sample (Fig. 1).Figure 1 Core genome maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains alongside other strains representative of the E. coli species and the cryptic Escherichia clades. The genome sequences of presumptive naturalized wastewater and meat plant E. coli strains were screened and downloaded from NCBI GenBank. To evaluate the evolutionary history of these strains in the context of the greater E. coli species, the core genome sequence variation of the naturalized wastewater (black and grey circles corresponding to those possessing and lacking the uspC–IS30–flhDC biomarker, respectively) and meat plant (red and pink circles corresponding to those possessing and lacking the uspC–IS30–flhDC biomarker, respectively) strains were compared to enteric (blue circles), ExPEC (purple circles), lab reference E. coli (green circles), environmental E. coli (orange circles), and cryptic Escherichia (yellow circles) strains. Phylogroups of all strains in the phylogenetic tree are indicated by the inner ring and colored according to the upper legend. The main sequence types represented across the naturalized strains are indicated in the outermost ring. The tree is rooted against an E. albertii strain as the outgroup.

Despite clustering exclusively within a single phylogroup, the naturalized strains were distributed across multiple sequence types (STs). Twenty-seven naturalized strains were designated as ST635, followed by 8 that were designated as ST399, and one wastewater strain each designated as ST216 and ST48, respectively (Table 1). Interestingly, the wastewater and meat plant strains did not sub-structure according to their original source of isolation, but rather segregated according to the presence of the uspC–IS30–flhDC locus. Indeed, the ST635 lineage included all naturalized strains carrying the uspC–IS30–flhDC locus while the ST399 cluster mainly consisted of naturalized strains that lacked the locus. Serotyping revealed further sub-structuring amongst the naturalized strains, with several serotypes represented across the larger ST clusters identified. For instance, while ST635 contained all wastewater and meat plant strains positive for the uspC–IS30–flhDC locus, four different serotypes were represented, appearing to coincide with the original geographical source of isolation of the naturalized strains. This included O11:25 for most of the Canadian wastewater strains, O166:H25 for the U.K. wastewater strains, O9/O27:H7 for the lone Swiss wastewater strain, and O10:H25 for the Canadian meat plant strains (Table 1). Similarly, amongst the uspC–IS30–flhDC–negative naturalized strains comprising the ST399 clade, the rest of the Canadian meat plant strains were assigned the serotype O154:H12, whereas the two U.S. wastewater isolates ECONIH4 and ECONIH5 were designated as O8/O129_13_gp10:H30 and O166:H30, respectively. The two divergent naturalized wastewater strains, SZ4 and WW38, were also found to belong to unique serotypes as they were designated as O64:H20 and O11:H4, respectively. Notably, none of the naturalized strains shared the same serotype with any of the non-naturalized, host-associated strains included in the phylogenetic tree (see Supplementary Table S1 online).Table 1 Distribution of sequence types and serotypes across the naturalized wastewater and meat plant E. coli strains.

Ecotype prediction with naturalized wastewater and meat plant E. coli strains

To evaluate whether the phylogenetically distinct naturalized wastewater and meat plant E. coli populations could also represent distinct E. coli ecotypes, ecotype prediction analyses were performed. Given their distinct phylogenetic placement, a phylogeny-based ecotype prediction algorithm was used first. According to the Ecotype Simulation algorithm, two naturalized-associated ecotypes, designated as ‘Ecotype0004’ and ‘Ecotype0005’, were identified (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, instead of grouping the naturalized strains according to their original ecological niche (i.e., wastewater versus meat plants), ‘Ecotype0004’ was found to correspond to the ST635 naturalized strains harboring the uspC–IS30–flhDC locus, while ‘Ecotype0005’ included the ST399 naturalized strains and enteric strain Fec6 lacking the locus (Fig. 1). Consequently, the two divergent wastewater strains, SZ4 and WW38, were not assigned to either of the two predicted naturalized ecotypes, but instead clustered into a separate group, ‘Ecotype0006’ (Fig. 2a).Figure 2 Prediction of putative naturalized E. coli ecotypes. Validation of putative naturalized E. coli ecotypes using a phylogeny-based (i.e., unsupervised) approach via the Ecotype Simulation 2 algorithm and a supervised learning approach via logic regression. According to the (a) phylogeny-based approach, two putative naturalized-associated ecotypes were identified; however, two naturalized wastewater strains, SZ4 and WW38, were not identified as belonging to either of the naturalized ecotypes through this approach. In contrast, across 5 classification trials, the (b) logic regression-based approach clustered most naturalized strains into a singular naturalized ecotype, and was also able to correctly classify SZ4 and WW38 on a case-by-case basis. Regardless of the ecotype prediction approach used, however, the enteric strain Fec6 was included in the predicted naturalized ecotype(s) called.

As an alternative method, a supervised learning, logic regression-based approach was also used to cluster the naturalized strains in a phylogeny-independent manner. Based on the sequence variation within the asnS–ompF and csgDEFG–csgBAC intergenic regions, most wastewater and meat plant strains could be clustered into a single naturalized E. coli ecotype despite their differing sources of isolation (Fig. 2b). Across 5 independent classification trials, 35 of the 37 wastewater and meat plant strains were consistently determined to belong to the putative naturalized E. coli ecotype. Notably, the ST399 enteric strain Fec6 was also consistently classified as part of the putative naturalized ecotype, whereas the remaining two wastewater strains, SZ4 and WW38, were only classified as naturalized on a trial-by-trial basis, with each being assigned to the naturalized ecotype in 3 and 2 of the 5 classification trials, respectively. Interestingly, the classifications of SZ4 and WW38 appeared to be mutually exclusive, as in any one trial only one of the two strains were classified as naturalized by logic regression.

Comparative genomics of naturalized wastewater, naturalized meat plant, and host-associated E. coli strains

The wastewater and meat plant E. coli strains appear to be phylogenetically and ecotypically distinct from other strains in the E. coli species—especially when compared to host-derived strains. To further examine the genetic differences between the naturalized populations and their host-associated counterparts, a series of comparative genomic analyses were performed. Starting with average nucleotide identity (ANI), the naturalized strains expectedly shared ≥ 95% ANI with all other E. coli strains and the cryptic Escherichia clade I strain, but less than 95% ANI with the other cryptic Escherichia clade strains (see Supplementary Table S2 online). Consistently, both the naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains were also found to exhibit higher within-group ANI (i.e., amongst other wastewater and/or meat plant strains) than when compared to strains belonging to other ecotypes.

To assess whether the high within-group genomic similarity shared amongst the wastewater and meat plant strains could correlate with distinct genetic features corresponding to the naturalized lifestyle, pairwise genome alignments were also performed. While all genome maps revealed extensive commonality amongst the strains compared regardless of the reference strain used, several gaps were observed in the alignments. Most gaps were observed in the alignments rooted against the naturalized wastewater (Fig. 3a) and meat plant (Fig. 3b) reference strains, representing genetic regions found in the wastewater and meat plant strains that were absent in their host-associated counterparts. Interestingly, the wastewater- and meat plant-rooted maps also contained regions that were commonly unique or over-represented in both wastewater and meat plant groups, representing genetic regions that were generally characteristic of the naturalized strains. To a lesser extent, gaps were also observed in the map rooted against the host-associated strain (Fig. 3c), representing genetic regions that were missing in the naturalized strains when compared to their host-associated counterparts.Figure 3 Serial pairwise genomic alignment maps of naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains with enteric, extraintestinal pathogenic, and environmental strains. Genome alignment maps of representative E. coli strains belonging to five ecotypic groups, including naturalized wastewater, naturalized meat plant, enteric (including both commensal and InPEC strains), ExPEC, and environmental E. coli, rooted against (a) a reference naturalized wastewater strain, WW10; (b) a reference naturalized meat plant strain, CX20; and (c) a reference host-associated strain, HS. In each alignment map, the reference strain's coding sequences (CDS), tRNA genes and rRNA genes are depicted as the outer two blue rings, with the reference genome included as the solid ring just inside the two outer rings. Against each reference genome, strains belonging to different ecotypes are aligned, including, from outermost to innermost: (i) the naturalized wastewater strains (black rings) WW10, ABWA45 and RHBSTW_00141 as uspC–IS30–flhDC–positive strains, and WW38 as a uspC–IS30–flhDC–negative strain; (ii) the naturalized meat plant strains (red rings) CX20 and CX05 as uspC–IS30–flhDC–positive strains and 0H24 as a uspC–IS30–flhDC negative strain; (iii) the enteric strains (blue rings), including HS, Fec6, SE11, SE15, and IAI1 as commensal strains, and EDL933 and E2348_69 as intestinal pathogenic strains; (iv) the ExPEC strains (purple rings) 219, UTI89, CFT073, 536, and CE10; and (v) the environmental strains WAT and SMS_3_5. Gaps in each alignment indicating genetic sequences unique to the reference ecotype (black arrows), as well as those unique to the naturalized ecotype generally (red arrows), are also depicted in the center of the maps.

Pan-genome analysis of naturalized wastewater and meat plant E. coli strains against other representative E. coli strains

A pan-genome was estimated for the 37 naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains alongside 76 representative commensal E. coli, InPEC, ExPEC, lab reference E. coli, environmental E. coli and cryptic Escherichia strains (see Supplementary Table S1 online). The pan-genome consisted of 37,502 total genes, including 1885 that were ‘core’ and shared by ≥ 98% of the strains included in the analysis (see Supplementary Fig. S1 online). To specifically evaluate the distribution of genes within the estimated pan-genome, a pan-genome spectrum function analysis22,23 was performed. In this analysis, the spectrum function produced a curve containing slight internal peaks, suggesting that the genes were non-homogenously distributed across the strains in the pan-genome24,25. Interestingly, these internal peaks appeared to coincide with sets of genes that were unique to the naturalized strains (see Supplementary Fig. S2 online).

To identify the specific genes associated with the ecology of the wastewater and meat plant strains, a pan-genome-wide association study was performed. Of the 2501 genes identified by Scoary to be statistically correlated with the naturalized strains, 2082 were found to be over-represented amongst the naturalized strains when compared to other strains in the E. coli species, whereas 419 were under-represented (see Supplementary Fig. S3a online). Although 736 genes had no known function, the remaining 1765 were distributed across several functional categories, including those that could be particularly relevant for a naturalized lifestyle (see Supplementary Fig. S3b online). Notably, the naturalized strains appeared to be relatively enriched in genes involved in adhesion and biofilm formation, microbial defense, and stress resistance, but lacked genes associated with virulence and colonization (Fig. 3).

Regarding specific genes important for adhesion and biofilm formation, both wastewater and meat plant strains were found to encode the alternative Yfc fimbrial system which appears to play a role in adhesion to environmental surfaces26 (see Supplementary Table S3 online). Beyond this, the wastewater strains encoded components of other alternative fimbrial systems, including Yeh and Elf fimbriae, also involved in environmental adhesion26, as well as duplicates of the genes hns and glgS, which appear to play regulatory roles in biofilm formation. Similarly, the meat plant strains were also characterized by biofilm regulation genes such as bhsA and bigR, which could enhance control over the formation of biofilms, especially in response to changing environmental conditions.

The naturalized strains were also found to be enriched in genes associated with microbial defense mechanisms. For instance, the naturalized strains harbored an abundance of toxin-antitoxin system genes, including those shared between the wastewater and meat plant strains such as higAB, vapC, rcbA, and ykfI, as well as genes specifically associated with the wastewater strains, such as parDE, and meat plant strains, including pemIK, ccdAB, yafW, and ldrD, respectively (see Supplementary Table S3 online). Furthermore, the naturalized strains possessed a myriad of defense genes against phages and other invasive mobile genetic elements, including the common anti-phage defense protein pld; the meat plant-associated restriction-modification system protein hsdM; and the wastewater-associated restriction-modification system proteins hsdR, hindIIIM, and hindIIIR, and the CRISPR-Cas system protein casC.

Most notably, the naturalized strains were characterized by an abundance of stress resistance genes. Both wastewater and meat plant strains were enriched in DNA repair and SOS response genes such as recT, recF, dam, lexA, rusA, addA, yhcG, dinI, umuD and umuC (see Supplementary Table S3 online). The naturalized strains also possessed various oxidative stress genes, including common antioxidant proteins such as adhE and oxidative damage repair chaperones such as msrA and msrB. Furthermore, the wastewater strains were also found to harbor the redox modulator alx, antioxidant proteins such as yfcG, oxidative stress proteins including stiP and yceC, and the electrophilic stress protein kefC, whereas the meat plant strains were characterized by the chlorine resistance proteins nemA and nemR. Interestingly, despite their role in responses against reactive chlorine species, the naturalized strains appeared to lack the chlorine resistance genes rclR and rclA.

Beyond DNA-damaging stimuli and oxidative stress, the naturalized strains also harbored various heavy metal resistance systems, including the cus, pco, and cop systems involved in copper resistance, as well as the sil system involved in silver resistance (see Supplementary Table S3 online). Furthermore, while the wastewater strains possessed the ars arsenical resistance system and the mer mercuric resistance system, the meat plant strains harbored additional copper resistance genes including cueR and csoR. The naturalized strains also possessed various genes involved in other stress responses, including several heat shock proteins such as htpX, clpC, ftsH4, hspA, pphA and clpP, and the cold shock protein ves. Remarkably, beyond these annotated genes, the wastewater and meat plant strains additionally harbored a myriad of hypothetical proteins that, based on sequence homology, appear to further augment functions related to biofilm formation, microbial defense, and stress resistance (see Supplementary Table S3 online).

While the naturalized strains harbored an abundance of genes associated with functions relevant for survival in their engineered niches, they also appeared to lack genes likely required for success in the original host environment. For instance, the naturalized strains were found to lack various virulence factors, including the ExPEC-associated kps capsule biosynthesis genes27, various secretion system structural and effector proteins, and a myriad of sequestration proteins involved in the acquisition of iron and other essential metals (see Supplementary Table S3 online). Furthermore, the naturalized strains were also found to lack various host colonization genes, including stress resistance and detoxification genes required for survival during passage through the stomach28 and within the gastrointestinal tract29, such as gadA, ecdB, and vdcD, as well key colonization factors30,31 such as nanS and the ecp operon (ecpRABCDE).

The characteristic over- and under-representation of certain functions within the wastewater and meat plant strains (Fig. 3) suggests that their naturalization could have reduced their fitness within the original host environment. To assess the gene–gene interactions across the pan-genome, particularly those relevant to the naturalized strains, gene association and dissociation networks were generated. Generally, associative gene–gene interactions reflected ecology, as the networks of genes that co-occurred within the naturalized strains were associated with functions relevant for survival within the engineered niche, including biofilm formation, microbial defense, and stress resistance (see Supplementary Fig. S4a online). Conversely, co-occurring genes that were lacking in the naturalized strains were associated with virulence and colonization—functions typically associated with the host environment. Interestingly, interactions between these two groups of genes appeared to be antagonistic as select genes linked with colonization (i.e., ‘ecpRABCDE’ and ‘nanS’) that were under-represented in the naturalized strains formed large dissociation networks with genes involved in stress resistance, biofilm formation, and microbial defense that were conversely over-represented in the naturalized strains (see Supplementary Fig. S4b online).

Discussion

While E. coli is known to colonize a wide range of human and animal hosts, select subpopulations appear to have evolved to reside primarily in natural, non-host environments6 as distinct naturalized E. coli ‘ecotypes’. In this study, we provide several lines of evidence suggesting that the naturalization phenomenon within E. coli has extended beyond natural environments and may include various water and food-associated engineered niches. Given that ecotypes have been suggested to represent the fundamental units of bacterial diversity32,33, the prospect that the wastewater and meat plant strains could represent a novel naturalized E. coli ecotype was first assessed based on their phylogenetic clustering relative to other strains in the E. coli species. Confirming previous analyses16,19, all wastewater and meat plant strains clustered within phylogroup A (Fig. 1), a phylogroup that has previously been found to be associated with non-pathogenic strains34–36, suggesting that the naturalized strains may be largely non-pathogenic. Despite this, the close grouping of the wastewater strains WW38 and SZ4 with a host-associated counterpart and the inclusion of the enteric strain Fec6 within the near-exclusive naturalized monophyletic cluster (Fig. 1) could suggest that these naturalized populations may have evolved from an originally host-derived strain after repeated passage through wastewater treatment plants and/or meat processing facilities.

Despite their exclusive placement within phylogroup A, the wastewater and meat plant strains were found to sub-cluster into two distinct monophyletic groups within the phylogenetic tree. Interestingly, these monophyletic clusters appeared to correspond closely with two main sequence type lineages, consisting of ST635 strains possessing the uspC–IS30–flhDC biomarker and ST399 strains without the biomarker, regardless of their original source of isolation. Interestingly, these sequence types have been previously associated with E. coli populations recovered from other built environments, particularly those related to water disinfection and sanitation. For instance, septic tank isolates recovered by Behruznia et al.37,38 were found to be non-randomly distributed across 3 main lineages, including clonal complex 10, which was proposed to be mainly host- and freshwater-associated, as well as clonal complex 399 and sequence type 401, which were found to be strongly associated with the septic tank niche. Similarly, Constantinides et al.39 found that non-clinical E. coli isolates colonizing hospital sink drains could be clustered into 4 sequence type lineages, including ST635, ST401, ST472 and ST399. As such, distinct E. coli populations, particularly those corresponding to the ST635 and ST399 lineages, appear to be particularly predisposed to becoming naturalized, and specifically within engineered environments associated with food and water sanitation.

The phylogenetic findings raise the prospect that the wastewater and meat plant strains could represent distinct naturalized E. coli ecotypes. Reflecting this, two independent ecotype prediction approaches were able to distinguish the naturalized strains from the rest of the E. coli species, though the specific ecotypes predicted differed depending on the approach used (Fig. 2). Of the two ecotype prediction approaches used, logic regression appeared to exhibit greater classification power due to its ability to classify a greater number of wastewater and meat plant strains as naturalized. As other studies have utilized a similar method for clustering E. coli strains according to their original ecological source with high specificity16,40,41, logic regression could represent a novel approach for the identification of putative ecotypes within a bacterial species. Notably, however, regardless of the approach used the wastewater and meat plant strains could not be distinguished based on their original ecological source of isolation. While this could suggest that these two populations collectively represent one general naturalized E. coli ecotype dispersed across various engineered environments, this finding could also be due to the current limitations of the ecotype prediction approaches used—especially for logic regression. The logic regression analysis in this study was performed based only on the sequence variation contained within two intergenic regions (i.e., asnS–ompF and csgDEFG–csgBAC) within the E. coli genome. Given that previous analyses have found that different intergenic regions can encode varying degrees of niche-relevant information41, the selection of alternative or a greater number of intergenic loci could improve the discrimination power of the logic regression algorithm, and allow for the sub-classification of the wastewater and meat plant strains into distinct ecotypes.

Regardless of the specific ecotypes predicted, the wastewater and meat plant strains appeared to be genetically distinct when compared to other ecotypes in the E. coli species. Reflecting this, the wastewater and meat plant strains were found to consistently share higher within-group ANI similarity than when compared to other E. coli ecotypic groups (see Supplementary Table S2 online). Although genomic similarity measures like ANI have historically been used for demarcating bacterial species rather than ecotypes42, strains that share common ecotypic properties should be more similar genetically than those with different ecotypic traits. As such, the high within-group ANI similarity shared by the naturalized strains provides additional support for their designation as a distinct, naturalized E. coli ecotype. Importantly, while the high within-group genomic similarity and monophyletic clustering of the wastewater and meat plant strains indicate that they could all be clonal, the presence of multiple serotypes amongst the naturalized strains (Table 1) suggests that several naturalized E. coli lineages have independently emerged across various food- and water-associated engineered environments.

In line with their designation as a distinct E. coli ecotype, the naturalized strains were found to possess distinct genetic features reflecting their adaptation towards the wastewater or meat plant niche. Indeed, the naturalized strains were enriched in various genes associated with biofilm formation, microbial defense, and stress resistance—functions that would presumably be advantageous in non-host contexts (Fig. 4). For instance, the use of alternative fimbrial systems and additional biofilm regulators could enhance the ability of the naturalized strains to form biofilms, thereby increasing their tolerance to the extreme stressors (i.e., low temperatures, disinfection-related stressors [i.e., chlorine, advanced oxidants, UV], etc.) encountered in engineered environments43–45. Reflecting this, previous work conducted by Zhi et al.15 found that naturalized wastewater strains were particularly robust biofilm producers, forming biofilms at roughly three times the capacity of their enteric counterparts. The naturalized strains also harbored an abundance of microbial defense genes, including various toxin-antitoxin systems to survive the intense inter-microbial competition against the complex microbial communities within wastewater matrices46 and meat processing facilities47. Interestingly, the wastewater strains specifically were found to be enriched in genes associated with restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas systems, which could protect against the heavy load of phages present in sewage and wastewater48–50. Above all else, the naturalized strains were most notably characterized by an over-abundance of stress resistance genes mediating responses against stressors typically encountered during disinfection, including DNA-damaging stimuli (i.e., UV radiation), oxidative stress (i.e., oxidants, reactive oxygen species, reactive electrophilic species, chlorine), heat shock (i.e., composting of human biosolids, steam pasteurization), and heavy metals. Interestingly, a select subset of these stress resistance genes appeared to be niche-specific. For instance, the wastewater strains were found to harbor additional heavy metal resistance systems against arsenic and mercury, heavy metal species that appear to be common constituents in wastewater51–53. In contrast, the meat plant strains were found to harbor the chlorine resistance genes nemA and nemR, which could enhance resistance against the bleach-based sanitizers used in food processing operations. Importantly, reflecting the over-representation of these disinfection-related stress resistance genes within the naturalized groups, the naturalized strains have been found to exhibit enhanced resistance to disinfection related stressors, including against high temperatures up to 60 °C18,19, as well as advanced oxidants and chlorine18.Figure 4 Presence/absence heatmap of genes statistically correlated with the naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains when compared to other strains representative of the E. coli species, as determined by Scoary. All genes in the pan-genome estimated by Roary were statistically scored (p < 1E−5, with Benjamini–Hochberg correction) against the naturalized strains to determine genes that could be associated with the distinct ecology of the wastewater and meat plant strains, especially in comparison to strains belonging to the other major E. coli ecotypes, including enteric commensal and InPEC strains, ExPEC strains, lab reference strains, environmental (i.e., naturalized in non-engineered environments) strains, and cryptic Escherichia strains. The function of each annotated gene was determined after cross-referencing each gene against their corresponding entry in the UniProt and EcoCyc databases, while the functions of unannotated genes were inferred through sequence homology shared with protein entries in the NCBI Protein database. Several functions were represented across the genes identified by Scoary, and based on the characteristic distribution of genes across the strains analyzed, the wastewater and meat plant strains appeared to be enriched in genes associated with adhesion and biofilm formation (red), microbial defense mechanisms (green) and stress resistance (blue), but were relatively lacking in genes related to colonization (yellow) and virulence (purple).

The naturalized strains, however, were also found to simultaneously lack various genes likely required for success within the original host environment. The wastewater and meat plant strains, for instance, lacked various metal acquisition and secretion system genes that could enhance fitness within the host environment54–57. Furthermore, the naturalized strains also lacked various genes required for the successful colonization of a host gastrotinestinal tract, including for survival during passage through the stomach28, key colonization factors30,31, and protection against the toxic metabolites produced within the gut29. Interestingly, some of these host-colonization genes, such as the ecpRABCDE operon and nanS, were found to be negatively correlated with the biofilm formation, defense, and stress resistance genes that were over-represented amongst the naturalized strains (see Supplementary Fig. S4b online), suggesting that the genetic adaptations acquired to tolerate the harsh conditions encountered in engineered environments may have come at the cost of fitness within the original host niche (i.e., antagonistic pleiotropy).

Collectively, our evidence points to the existence of distinct naturalized populations of E. coli that have evolved to exploit various food- and water-associated engineered environments as primary niches. To date, these naturalized strains have only been isolated from food and water industrial contexts, including meat processing facilities20, wastewater14–16, septic tanks37,38, and sink drains39. While the wastewater and meat plant strains assessed in this study do not appear to be pathogenic or even host-associating, their characterization highlights a concerning prospect: that microbes, including those that could represent a pathogenic risk, could be evolving resistance to disinfection. Reflecting this, previous studies have found that repeated exposure to monochloramine water disinfection promoted the development of resistant populations of E. coli58, with > 60% of cells remaining viable after treatment59. Importantly, while this present study focuses on naturalized E. coli, the same selective pressures are likely operating for the rest of the microbiome within these engineered environments. For instance, given that many of the genes over-represented in the naturalized strains were duplicates of genes widely distributed across the E. coli pan-genome (see Supplementary Table S3 online), other E. coli populations could similarly amplify certain key genes to modify their capacity to respond to the extreme stressors (i.e., disinfection) encountered in the engineered environment60. Alternatively, these naturalized populations could also act as reservoirs for the dissemination of disinfection resistance to other microbial populations through horizontal gene transfer61. Indeed, with studies demonstrating that a significant proportion of E. coli strains surviving wastewater treatment are virtually identical to clinical ExPEC across all genomic levels62,63, the evolution of disinfection resistance in the microbial world could represent a novel and emerging risk to public health.

Conclusion

Conventionally, E. coli is understood as a host-associated microbe; however, advances in the field of environmental microbiology have led to the characterization of naturalized E. coli that have diverged from their host-associated counterparts. This naturalization phenomenon appears to have extended to non-host, non-natural (i.e., man-made) engineered environments as distinct populations of E. coli, or ‘ecotypes’, appear to have emerged within wastewater treatment plants and meat processing facilities. Specifically, the phylogenetic, ecotypic, and genomic evidence presented in this study point to the existence of naturalized E. coli that have adapted to survive within food- and water-associated engineered environments at a potential cost of fitness in the original host niche. Importantly, even though these naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains no longer appear to be host-associating, the same evolutionary forces underlying their emergence are likely operating for all other microbes present within these environments. Indeed, while they may not represent a direct pathogenic risk to human health, the characterization of these naturalized strains points to a frightening prospect warranting further research—that microbes, including pathogens, could be evolving resistance to disinfection.

Materials and methods

Core genome phylogenetics and typing of naturalized strains

All publicly available E. coli genomes representing presumptive naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains were identified in the NCBI GenBank database by screening for the uspC–IS30–flhDC sequence (GenBank Accession Number: ON075843.1) using BLAST. The genome sequences of strains bearing the full uspC–IS30–flhDC locus were then downloaded from NCBI GenBank (accessed: 01-26-2022) alongside previously-described naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains without the uspC–IS30–flhDC locus16,20. For comparative purposes, the genome sequences of additional representative E. coli strains across phylogroups, lifestyles (i.e., commensal, intestinal pathogenic, extraintestinal pathogenic, environmental), and isolation source (i.e., host and environmental niches), as well as Escherichia strains across the cryptic clades21 (i.e., as an additional environmentally-adapted group of non-E. coli strains within the genus Escherichia) and an E. albertii strain, were also downloaded from NCBI GenBank (accessed: 01-26-2022). The genomes were annotated using Prokka64 v1.14.6, after which Roary65 v3.13.0 was used to produce a core genome alignment for the generation of a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree by RAxML66 v8.2.12, with E. albertii as the outgroup.

The phylogroups of the strains included in the phylogenetic tree were determined through the ClermonTyping method, using the ClermonTyper67 v23.06 webserver. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed using mlst v2.22.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/mlst) with the Escherichia coli #1 scheme and cross-referenced against the PubMLST database using the Achtman scheme68. The serotypes of each strain were determined with ABRicate (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) using the EcOH database. The phylogenetic tree was visualized and annotated with R software, using the R packages ggplot269 v3.4.2, ape70 v5.4.1, and ggtree71 v2.2.4. All information related to the bacterial strains included in the phylogenetic tree can be found in Supplementary Table S1 online.

Ecotype prediction of naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains

To assess whether the pan-genomic characteristics of the naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains reflect distinct naturalized E. coli ecotypes, ecotype prediction analyses were performed. Putative ecotypes represented across the E. coli strains analyzed were predicted using two methods. First, a phylogenetics-based approach was employed using the Ecotype Simulation 2 algorithm72. To maintain consistency with the analyses described above, the algorithm was run using the core-genome maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree previously produced by RAxML and the core genome alignment previously produced by Roary, such that all ecotype prediction analyses were performed on the same set of strains used for the phylogenetic analysis.

Additionally, logic regression17 was also used as an alternative, phylogeny-independent method to assess whether the naturalized strains could be distinguished as distinct naturalized E. coli ecotypes. Following previous workflows40,41, the asnS–ompF and csgDEFG–csgBAC intergenic sequences were screened from all strains included in the analysis using BLAST, extracted using bedtools v2.30.0 (https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2), and then aligned with Clustal Omega73. Using a custom R script (available in supplementary information online S1) the aligned intergenic sequences were analyzed using logic regression to identify key SNP-SNP patterns that could be used to classify the strains as either naturalized or non-naturalized. Five random seed numbers were generated with R such that this classification step could be completed over five separate trials, and the results from each iteration were combined (raw results available in supplementary information S1).

Genetic similarity of naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains with enteric, extraintestinal pathogenic, and environmental E. coli

To assess the degree of genomic similarity shared between and amongst strains belonging to each ecotypic group, an average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis was performed. Specifically, the ANI shared between each strain was calculated in a pairwise fashion (i.e., between two strains at a time) using fastANI42 v1.33 to produce an ANI similarity matrix (see Supplementary Table S2 online). Pairwise whole genome alignments were also performed to identify genetic regions that could be uniquely characteristic to the different ecotypic groups (i.e., naturalized, host-associated, etc.). Strains were selected to represent five E. coli ecotypes, including naturalized wastewater (WW10, ABWA45, RHBSTW_00141, WW38), naturalized meat plant (CX20, CX05, 0H24), enteric (HS, Fec6, SE11, SE15, IAI1, EDL933, E2348_69), ExPEC (219, UTI89, CFT073, 536, CE10), and environmental (WAT, SMS_3_5) groups, as indicated in Supplementary Table S1 online. Three sets of pairwise alignments were performed with BLAST, with the genome alignment for each strain rooted against a reference naturalized wastewater strain (E. coli WW10), a reference naturalized meat plant strain (E. coli CX20), or a reference host-associated strain (E. coli HS). The genome alignment maps were then visualized and annotated with the reference strain’s coding sequences (CDS) using the Proksee74 webserver.

Pan-genomic analyses of naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains with enteric, extraintestinal pathogenic, and environmental E. coli

A pan-genomic analysis was performed on an expanded repository consisting of the genome sequences of: (a) all naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains; (b) human and animal commensal E. coli strains; (c) intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains (i.e., EHEC, STEC, EPEC, ETEC, EAEC, EIEC, DAEC); (d) extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli strains (i.e., UPEC, BBEC, NMEC, APEC); (e) laboratory reference E. coli strains; (f) environmental E. coli strains (i.e., naturalized in natural contexts); and (g) cryptic Escherichia strains (Supplementary Table S1). All strains included in the pan-genomic analysis (n = 113) were annotated using Prokka64 v1.14.6, after which a pan-genome was estimated with Roary65 v3.13.0. Genes that were left unannotated were screened against all bacterial protein sequences available on the NCBI Protein database with BLAST, and their function was inferred based on sequence homology and the identification of conserved functional domains. The distribution of genes within the estimated pan-genome was then evaluated using a pan-genome spectrum function22–25.

To characterize the genomic features underlying the distinct ecology of the naturalized wastewater and meat plant strains, a pan-genome-wide association study (pan-GWAS) was performed. Scoary75 v1.6.16 was used to score every gene in the pan-genome to identify genes that were statistically over-represented and under-represented across the naturalized strains. Three separate analyses were performed, to find genes that were correlated with: (a) the naturalized wastewater group specifically; (b) the naturalized meat plant group specifically, and; (c) the naturalized group as a whole. All Scoary runs were performed with the ‘–no_pairwise’ flag and used the Benjamini–Hochberg correction method with a p-value cut-off of 1E-5, as recommended by the developers (https://github.com/AdmiralenOla/Scoary).

The results from each run were combined, after which duplicate gene entries, truncated genes, and genes present in fewer than 75% of naturalized strains were screened out. The remaining genes were then broadly classified according to their prevalence amongst the naturalized strains, as either: (a) ‘absent’, if they were not present in any of the naturalized strains; (b) ‘duplicate’, if the gene of interest in the naturalized strains appeared to be a copy of another gene that was already widely prevalent across the strains included in the analysis; (c) ‘shared’, if the gene of interest was the only copy in the naturalized strains, but was still shared amongst other strains in the analysis; (d) ‘unique’, for gene entries that were present only in the naturalized strains, and; (e) ‘variant’, if there were multiple entries for a given gene, but for which specific entries appeared to be particularly over- or under-represented in the naturalized strains. Additionally, the genes were also categorized based on their distribution across the strains analysed, as either: (a) ‘wastewater-dominant’, if the gene entry’s prevalence was 40% higher in the wastewater strains compared to the meat plant strains; (b) ‘meat plant-dominant’, if the gene entry’s prevalence was 40% higher in the meat plant strains compared to the wastewater strains; (c) ‘common across wastewater and meat plant’, if the gene entry exhibited greater than 50% prevalence in both the wastewater and meat plant strains, but with no significant difference in sensitivity between the two groups; and (d) ‘lacking in wastewater and meat plant’, if the gene entry was under-represented in both groups of strains. All genes that were found to be statistically correlated with the naturalized groups by Scoary were functionally annotated after reference to the UniProt76 and EcoCyc77 databases. The distribution of these genes across the strains analyzed was then visualized through a presence/absence heatmap produced with R software using the ggplot2 v3.4.2 package69.

Coinfinder78 v1.2.1 was used to evaluate the interactions between accessory genes within the pan-genome and identify important gene association (i.e., the presence of one gene is linked to the presence of another) and dissociation (i.e., one gene is present specifically when another is absent) events occurring within the genomic background of the naturalized strains. Pan-genome association and dissociation networks were produced using Coinfinder based on the estimated pan-genome produced by Roary and a core genome phylogenetic tree produced with FastTree79 v2.1.11, with the Bonferroni correction method, as recommended by the developers (https://github.com/fwhelan/coinfinder). Gene–gene interaction network maps were then visualized using the Fruchterman Reingold layout with the Gephi platform80 and annotated using Inkscape software.
