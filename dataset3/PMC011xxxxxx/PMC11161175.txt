Facultative parthenogenesis (FP) has historically been regarded as rare in vertebrates, but in recent years incidences have been reported in a growing list of fish, reptile, and bird species. Despite the increasing interest in the phenomenon, the underlying mechanism and evolutionary implications have remained unclear. A common finding across many incidences of FP is either a high degree of homozygosity at microsatellite loci or low levels of heterozygosity detected in next-generation sequencing data. This has led to the proposal that second polar body fusion following the meiotic divisions restores diploidy and thereby mimics fertilization. Here, we show that FP occurring in the gonochoristic Aspidoscelis species A. marmoratus and A. arizonae results in genome-wide homozygosity, an observation inconsistent with polar body fusion as the underlying mechanism of restoration. Instead, a high-quality reference genome for A. marmoratus and analysis of whole-genome sequencing from multiple FP and control animals reveals that a post-meiotic mechanism gives rise to homozygous animals from haploid, unfertilized oocytes. Contrary to the widely held belief that females need to be isolated from males to undergo FP, females housed with conspecific and heterospecific males produced unfertilized eggs that underwent spontaneous development. In addition, offspring arising from both fertilized eggs and parthenogenetic development were observed to arise from a single clutch. Strikingly, our data support a mechanism for facultative parthenogenesis that removes all heterozygosity in a single generation. Complete homozygosity exposes the genetic load and explains the high rate of congenital malformations and embryonic mortality associated with FP in many species. Conversely, for animals that develop normally, FP could potentially exert strong purifying selection as all lethal recessive alleles are purged in a single generation.

Incidences of facultative parthenogenesis (FP) have been reported to occur in diverse vertebrate clades including bony fish (Lampert et al., 2007), sharks (Chapman et al., 2007; Chapman et al., 2008; Feldheim et al., 2010; Dudgeon et al., 2017), snakes (Dubach et al., 1997; Groot et al., 2003; Booth and Schuett, 2011; Germano and Smith, 2010; Booth et al., 2012; Kinney et al., 2013; Booth et al., 2014; Allen et al., 2018; Card et al., 2021), lizards (Lenk et al., 2005; Watts et al., 2006; Kratochvíl et al., 2020), crocodilians (Booth et al., 2023), and birds (Bartelmez and Riddle, 1924; Olsen and Marsden, 1954; Sarvella, 1973; Schut et al., 2008; Ramachandran and McDaniel, 2018; Parker et al., 2010). The phenomenon was originally mistaken for long-term sperm storage occurring in zoo environments where females were housed without current or recent access to conspecific males. The most parsimonious explanation was, therefore, that the animal had previously been in contact with a male and that stored sperm was responsible for delayed fertilization (Booth and Schuett, 2011; Holt and Lloyd, 2010; Sever and Hamlett, 2002). However, more recent studies involving microsatellite (MS) and/or amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses revealed no paternal contributions, as all alleles detected in the offspring were only found in the maternal ancestors (Groot et al., 2003; Booth and Schuett, 2011; Shibata et al., 2017; Ryder et al., 2021; Levine et al., 2024). Females with no access to males producing solely male (ZW systems) or female (XY systems) offspring that only harbor maternal genetic markers are now considered hallmarks of facultative parthenogenesis. Nevertheless, clear examples of long-term sperm storage have also been documented in the recent literature (Levine et al., 2021), underscoring the need for molecular methods such as MS analysis or sequencing data to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Originally thought to only occur in captivity, more recent reports indicate that FP occurs in natural populations as well (Booth et al., 2012; Fields et al., 2015). Serious concerns have been raised by conservation biologists, as species with dwindling population densities, including the endangered species Komodo dragon (Watts et al., 2006), small tooth sawfish (Fields et al., 2015), California condor (Ryder et al., 2021), and American crocodile (Booth et al., 2023) are overrepresented among reports of FP.

While overrepresentation could be a consequence of an increased likelihood of detection in species that are the subject of intense research and conservation efforts, the observations raise the question if FP is an adaptive trait aiding in the colonization of new areas and mitigating the effects of population bottlenecks or is simply a neutral trait (Fields et al., 2015). The adaptive trait hypothesis would of course require successful reproduction of FP animals either sexually or parthenogenetically, which to date has only been documented in a few cases (Kratochvíl et al., 2020; Straube et al., 2016). At the same time, the association of FP with increased homozygosity constitutes a concern for conservation biology, as an increase in FP within dwindling populations further accelerates the loss of genetic diversity, exposes deleterious alleles, and could compromise efforts to maintain the existing gene pool in selective breeding programs (Groot et al., 2003; Booth and Schuett, 2016). FP is also being studied as a desirable outcome in the commercial production of poultry. However, examination of tens of thousands of unfertilized eggs from several different avian species and strains has not resulted in economically sustainable hatching rates thus far. One of the highest hatch rates for unfertilized eggs is seen in the Beltsville small white turkey with a rate of 0.88% (Ramachandran and McDaniel, 2018; Olsen, 1975). A better understanding of the triggers and molecular mechanisms underlying FP and the fitness of the resulting offspring are, therefore, needed in a variety of contexts. These include: to understand a fundamental biological mechanism and its significance in vertebrate evolution, to aid in conservation efforts including captive breeding programs, and to possibly harness FP in an agricultural context (Ryder et al., 2021).

The high level of homozygosity observed in animals produced by FP has been interpreted as evidence for polar body fusion following meiosis II, also known as automixis, leading to the restoration of diploidy in unfertilized eggs (Figure 1A; Chapman et al., 2007; Card et al., 2021; Booth et al., 2023; Booth and Schuett, 2016; Reynolds et al., 2012). If automixis involves the fusion of one of the meiotic products from the first polar body (central automixis), homozygosity will be concentrated near the chromosome ends and heterozygosity will be preferentially retained near the centromeres as premeiotic recombination strongly favors homologs over sister chromatids and homologs segregate during the first meiotic division. In contrast, a second polar body fusion (terminal automixis) would reunite sister chromatids, for which heterozygosity is preferentially seen near the chromosome termini (Figure 1B). In many cases, heterozygous and homozygous loci appeared to be inherited in FP offspring (Groot et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2018; Card et al., 2021; Kratochvíl et al., 2020; Booth et al., 2023), but information as to the genomic location of these loci has been lacking. Central and terminal automixis are also distinguished by the extent of heterozygosity, with lower levels observed in next-generation sequencing data in snakes and crocodiles suggesting terminal automixis as the likely mechanism (Allen et al., 2018; Card et al., 2021; Booth et al., 2023).

Both offspring are homozygous at all loci with most alleles matching only maternal alleles. For MS16, offspring alleles are not shaded because of this allele being shared between the mother and the A. gularis male. Single nucleotide differences in size are common binning artifacts and, therefore, are not scored as different alleles.

Only alleles that are unique to a potential mother are colored. Single nucleotide differences in size are common binning artifacts and, therefore, are not scored as different alleles. The two offspring were homozygous for all eight markers. At three markers (MS7, MS9, MS10), both offspring inherited alleles only found in animal 122.

While facultative parthenogenesis occurs in a wide range of vertebrate species, true obligate parthenogenesis is limited to a few taxa of squamate reptiles including the North American whiptail lizards of the genus Aspidoscelis (Avise, 2015). Historic hybridization events between distinct gonochoristic species in this clade has given rise to numerous hybrid individuals with the ability to reproduce clonally as all female lineages (Vanzolini, 1993; Reeder et al., 2002). In contrast to the increased homozygosity associated with FP, obligate parthenogenetic species are characterized by the long-term preservation of the high degree of heterozygosity that had its origin in the lineage-founding cross-species hybridization events.

Our laboratory has a longstanding interest in the mechanism of obligate parthenogenesis in whiptail lizards (Lutes et al., 2010; Newton et al., 2016). In this context, we are maintaining and propagating individuals of several obligate parthenogenetic as well as gonochoristic species. MS analysis revealed over 20 incidences of FP in the marbled whiptail lizard, A. marmoratus and the Arizona striped whiptail, A. arizonae. (The taxonomy of the genus Aspidoscelis has undergone frequent revisions and the maternal ancestor of the obligate parthenogenetic species A. neomexicanus was formerly known as the subspecies A. tigris marmoratus and the male ancestor as the subspecies A. inornatus arizonae (Barley et al., 2022a). For the purpose of this manuscript we follow the taxonomic conclusions by Barley et al., 2021). Whiptail lizards have an XX/XY sex determination system (Cole et al., 1969) and all FP offspring are consequently female. The identification of multiple incidences of FP provided us with the opportunity to investigate the mechanism of FP in whiptail lizards through next-generation sequencing. The generation of a genome assembly, in addition to whole-genome sequencing, allowed us to distinguish between different mechanisms for restoring diploidy in FP animals. To address the question of whether FP is limited to animals in captivity, we examined reduced-representation sequencing (RAD-seq) data of 321 whiptail lizards from 15 gonochoristic species sampled in nature. In aggregate, a combination of MS analysis, next-generation sequencing, and cytological analysis allows us to report on both the evidence and mechanism of FP in whiptail lizards and suggest that a baseline incidence of FP may coexist alongside sexual reproduction in some species.

Results

Identification of FP in A. marmoratus

In the context of studying interspecific hybridization among gonochoristic species of whiptail lizards, three female A. marmoratus (ID 122, 4238, 4239) were housed with a male A. arizonae (ID 4272) and a male A. gularis (ID 302) for close to three years. During this period, seven hybrid offspring between A. marmoratus 122 and A. arizonae 4272 were produced and confirmed by MS analysis. These animals will be described in more detail in due course. Surprisingly, two female hatchlings emerged that resembled A. marmoratus rather than the expected products of hybridization with either A. arizonae or A. gularis. Genotyping revealed only a single allele for each of eight MS markers in the two offspring (ID 8449 and 8450, Figure 1D) and identified A. marmoratus (ID 122) as the mother (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The mother and the male A. arizonae were each heterozygous at five of the eight markers and the A. gularis male at six. Further supporting a uniparental origin of 8449 and 8450, all alleles found in the offspring were also present in the mother (Figure 1D). For seven of the eight markers, neither male shared the allele found in the hatchling lizards, providing strong evidence that neither male fathered the offspring. For the remaining marker MS16, the A. marmoratus mother and the A. gularis male were homozygous for the same allele found in the two offspring, therefore, not allowing a conclusion to be based on this locus. It is important to note that for two of the markers (MS7 and MS15), the two offspring inherited different alleles from the mother, indicating that they are not genetically identical to each other, but have randomly inherited one of the maternal alleles at each locus.

Two additional eggs (ID 8394 and 9070) were recovered from the same enclosure and found to contain developing embryos. MS analysis also revealed A. marmoratus 122 as the mother and complete homozygosity at all loci. Given that all of these offspring are female, inherited only maternal alleles, and animal 122 had no history of being housed with a conspecific male during its lifetime, both interspecific hybridization and long-term sperm storage are all but ruled out and FP is strongly supported.

FP animals of A. marmoratus presented a unique opportunity to examine the underlying molecular mechanism. The observed homozygosity at all MS loci further promised to aid in the generation of a high-quality genome assembly, as homozygosity circumvents the challenge of collapsing haplotypes into a consensus sequence (Kajitani et al., 2014). To increase homozygosity, inbreeding for 15–20 generations is common practice prior to whole-genome sequencing and genome assembly (Zhang et al., 2019; Fang et al., 2012). However, generation times of more than one year make this a costly and time-consuming strategy for many vertebrate species including A. marmoratus.

Genome sequencing and de novo assembly

The A. marmoratus genome is distributed over 23 chromosomes as previously demonstrated by metaphase spread analysis (Lowe and Wright, 1966). We used flow cytometry to compare nuclear DNA content of A. marmoratus erythrocytes from whole blood with cells from three species with well-characterized genome sizes. The nuclear DNA content of A. marmoratus was close to that of Danio rerio (1.4 Gb) and we calculated a haploid genome size for A. marmoratus of 1.55 Gb (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).

Genomic DNA of FP animal 8450 was used to generate short insert paired-end, mate-pair (5 Kb, 8 Kb, 2–15 Kb, 40 Kb), and Chicago (Putnam et al., 2016) libraries for Illumina short-read sequencing. The paired-end and mate-pair reads were first assembled with Meraculous (Chapman et al., 2011) yielding an N50 of 1.6 Mb. The subsequent addition of Chicago reads and scaffolding with the HiRise pipeline by Dovetail Genomics produced an assembly of 1,639,530,780 bp distributed over 3826 scaffolds (Supplementary file 1) and raised the scaffold N50 to 32.22 Mb (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). With a BUSCO completeness score of 96% the A. marmoratus genome assembly is comparable to other recently released reptilian genome assemblies (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Over 98% of the assembled sequences are contained within 90 scaffolds of more than 1 Mb in length, making this assembly highly contiguous.

Phylogenetic analysis of shared BUSCO genes with several other reference genomes (Xenopus, zebrafish, medaka, platyfish, tegu, green anole, chicken, mouse, rat, dog, cow, human) confirmed that A. marmoratus is most closely related to the tegu Salvator merianae, another representative of the family Teiidae (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). As transposable elements are a driving force in genome evolution, we examined the repeat content for the A. marmoratus genome. All classes of repeat elements combined amounted to 40.27% of the A. marmoratus assembly, only slightly below that found in other lizards S. merianae and Anolis carolinensis (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A). Strikingly, unclassified repeats make up the largest class of repeat elements in the A. marmoratus genome, an observation that parallels findings in S. merianae. However, a comparison between the unclassified repeats found in A. marmoratus, S. merianae, and A. carolinensis revealed few similarities with only around 10% of the unclassified repeats shared between A. marmoratus and S. merianae, and no significant overlap between these two species and A. carolinensis (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). While further characterization of the unclassified repeat elements is needed, it is apparent that an impressive expansion of novel repeat element classes has occurred within this clade.

To annotate the A. marmoratus genome, we assembled a total of 119,728 transcripts from RNA-seq data generated from blood and embryo using Trinity (Supplementary file 2). These transcripts were subsequently used in the MAKER2 gene annotation pipeline, yielding 25,856 protein-coding genes and 44,461 protein isoforms (Supplementary file 3). To assign a putative function, we used BLASTp to query the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (UniProt Consortium, 2018) and found significant hits for 76% of the putative protein-coding genes. Our assembly and annotation pipelines yielded 40 HOX genes and 2 EVX genes in four gene clusters (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). The HOX gene clusters are highly conserved among tetrapods and their complete presence and shared order within each cluster serve as a measure of assembly quality (Kuraku and Meyer, 2009).

Assessment of heterozygosity

The presence of only one allele for each of the examined MS markers already suggested widespread homozygosity in A. marmoratus produced by FP, consistent with similar observations in other vertebrate species. The highly contiguous genome assembly now afforded us the opportunity to probe the mechanism of FP by searching for regions of heterozygosity and mapping their relative genomic locations. Towards this aim, we performed whole-genome sequencing for an additional nine animals: four of them produced by FP (ID 12512, 12513, 6993, 9177), two mothers (ID 122, 9721), and three unrelated control animals (ID 003, 001, S30700; Supplementary file 4). Each mother and the controls were heterozygous at several MS markers confirming their origin through sexual reproduction. Following alignment to the reference genome (Supplementary file 5), we defined heterozygous sites as those covered by an even number of reads with two alleles supported by the same number of reads. Sites covered by an odd number of reads were filtered out for this initial analysis. This stringent requirement was chosen to limit the search to apparent heterozygous sites with strong support, decreasing the chance of false positives.

For all ten individuals, the average sequencing coverage ranged between 15.91 and 20.08 (Figure 2—figure supplement 5). For FP animals, the number of heterozygous sites in a 10 Kb sliding window approaches zero for all sites with mean coverage (Figure 2A). For positions with coverage greater than the average, an increase in apparent heterozygosity was observed, due to the collapse of repetitive sequences during the assembly process. Based on this observation, we limited further analysis to positions in the genome where the coverage is equal to the mean sequencing depth (as defined by rounding the mean sequencing coverage value to the next even integer). For example, for animal 003, the average sequencing coverage is 18.31 (Figure 2—figure supplement 5A) and we only considered sites with a coverage of 20 (Figure 2—figure supplement 6A). This generated between 30,769 and 53,416 heterozygous sites for which two alleles were equally supported in the sexually produced mothers and control animals (Figure 2—figure supplement 6A–E). Far fewer heterozygous sites (between 649 and 928) were observed in the FP animals (Figure 2—figure supplement 6F–J). Plotting the heterozygous sites according to their position in the reference genome illustrates not only their sparsity in the genomes of FP animals, but also reveals their random distribution (Figure 2B). If FP genomes were the product of automixis, regions of homozygosity would be interspersed with regions of heterozygosity. The extent of heterozygosity within the latter would be the same as that observed in the respective mother. The few apparently heterozygous sites identified in FP animals are, therefore, not supporting either form of automixis but are most likely the result of over-assembly of repetitive regions (ie. collapsing paralogous loci into a single representative sequence) and a combination of biological (ie. somatic mutations) and technical errors (ie. PCR and sequencing errors).

Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data for five sexually produced animals (ID 003, 001, 122, S30700, 9721) and five individuals produced by facultative parthenogenetic (FP) animals (ID 6993, 9177, 8450, 12512, 12513) were aligned to the reference genome. In FP animals, the number of heterozygous sites approaches zero for sites with mean coverage (x̄=18.37). (B) Scaffolds are ordered from largest to smallest on the x-axis.

There are 10 additional copies of Vmn2r26 homologs found on Scaffold 45 not identified by MAKER2 (177 total), while genome-wide, we annotated 323 copies. Phylogenetic analysis of the 323 copies with eight other mouse vomeronasal two receptors show that the mouse receptors form their own distinct clade from A. marmoratus and there is substantial sequence diversity among the A. marmoratus homologs. A manual search for additional copies of Vmn2r26 resulted in 478 further hits. Vmn2r26 belongs to a family of receptors known as V2Rs and this estimate on the number of Vmn2r26 homologs ranks A. marmoratus as one of the species with the largest expansion of V2Rs (Shi and Zhang, 2007; Brykczynska et al., 2013).

When examining each mother-daughter group, the average number of heterozygous sites per 10 Kb window was greater in the sexually produced mothers across the entire assembly (Figure 2C). For most of the assembly, the average number of heterozygous sites remained close to zero for FP animals. The most notable exception was a region around genomic coordinate 1.0 Gb, but even there the extent of apparent heterozygosity remained below 50% of what is observed in this region for each of the mothers. Examination of the scaffold in question (Scaffold 45) revealed 167 genes annotated as homologous to vomeronasal 2 receptor 26 (Vmn2r26; Figure 2—figure supplement 7, Figure 2—figure supplement 8). Members of this subfamily of receptors are found on the microvilli of the vomeronasal organ, where they are responsible for pheromone detection and play a significant role in social and environmental responses (Ryba and Tirindelli, 1997; Houck, 2009; Su et al., 2009). Given that this genomic region harbors a large cluster of highly similar genes, the most parsimonious explanation for the elevated level of apparent heterozygosity is over-assembly. This conclusion is further supported by the increase in apparent heterozygosity in this region for the mothers and control animals. In aggregate, our analysis strongly supports genome-wide homozygosity for FP animals, inconsistent with either central or terminal automixis. Instead, the results favor a post-meiotic mechanism that restores diploidy by replicating the haploid genome residing in the oocyte following completion of the two meiotic divisions and thereby establishing genome-wide homozygosity in the offspring.

Cryptic FP in A. arizonae

Following the identification of several A. marmoratus generated by FP, we genotyped individuals from two other gonochoristic species housed in our laboratory. While no cases of FP were identified among 80 A. gularis produced eggs in captivity, we identified eight incidences of FP among 832 A. arizonae records between October 2007 and July 2018. During the same period, we recorded 15 incidences of FP among 286 A. marmoratus records (Supplementary file 6). Notably, in all cases, eggs undergoing FP development had been laid in enclosures where females were housed with conspecific males or males of a sister species known to mate with the heterospecific females. Isolation from mating partners was thus not a significant factor in triggering FP. In one enclosure, three A. arizonae females (ID 12850, 12851, 12852) were housed with a conspecific male (ID 12849; Figure 3A). MS analysis of four hatchlings that originated from a single clutch laid in this enclosure identified animal 12852 as the mother of all four animals. Unexpectedly, two of her offspring were homozygous at all eight loci examined, whereas the two others were heterozygous at all loci, identifying animal 12849 as their father (Figure 3B). Therefore, both fertilized and unfertilized eggs developed alongside each other within the same clutch.

(A) Microsatellite analysis for the four co-housed adult animals (ID 12849, 12850, 12851, 12852) and the four hatchlings (ID 16213, 16214, 16215, 16216) produced in this enclosure. Alleles are color-coded for each potential parent: 12849 male (blue), 12850 female (green), 12851 female (orange), 12852 female (red). Differences in shading highlight the two alleles at heterozygous loci. Offspring 16213 and 16214 are heterozygous at all loci, with most loci having one allele matching 12849 and one allele matching 12852. Offspring 16215 and 16216 are homozygous at all loci, with most alleles matching only the 12852 female. Non-shaded offspring alleles indicate ambiguous inheritance as multiple adult animals share the same allele. Single nucleotide differences in size are common binning artifacts and, therefore, are not scored as different alleles. (B) Pedigree shows the relationship between the four offspring. The single clutch of four contains both sexually (yellow) and facultative parthenogenetically (blue) produced offspring.

Mixoploid erythrocytes and developmental defects

Microscopic examination of blood from a newly hatched FP lizard revealed a striking bimodality in the sizes of erythrocyte nuclei when compared to a sexually produced animals (Figure 4A, B). Nuclear size correlates well with DNA content measurements (Walker et al., 1991), suggesting the presence of mixoploidy in the FP animal. Whereas most cells closely resembled those observed in the blood from the sexually produced animal, approximately 10% of red blood cells from the FP animal harbored smaller nuclei, consistent with half the amount of DNA (Figure 4B). In addition, 1.27% contained two small nuclei, indicating that the final cytokinesis during erythrocyte differentiation had failed for some haploid progenitor cells. DNA content analysis by flow cytometry confirmed the presence of haploid cells (Figure 4C). In the blood of sexually produced animals, no haploid or bi-nucleated cells were observed. These observations raise the possibility that the embryonic development of FP animals is initiated with consecutive divisions of a haploid, unfertilized oocyte. At a later stage in development, diploid cells most likely arise via failed cytokinesis. From that point forward, both haploid and diploid cells coexist, and the embryo develops in a mixoploid state. Indicative of a more widespread phenomenon, mixoploidy was also observed in another FP A. marmoratus and in A. arizonae (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). The observed fraction of haploid cells was closer to 1% in these instances.

Genome-wide loss of heterozygosity exposes functionally compromised alleles that were previously covered by intact alleles on the homologous chromosomes. Depending on the extent of this genetic load, one would expect a substantial fraction of oocytes to not develop at all or for defects to manifest at various stages of embryonic and post-embryonic development. Indeed, of the 23 incidences of FP examined here, only 14 hatched, while the remaining lizards died in ovum (Supplementary file 6). For these nine unhatched eggs, we isolated developed embryos shortly after the expected hatch date and confirmed FP origin by MS analysis. The clutches that produced the 23 confirmed cases of FP contained an additional 24 eggs. For these, development did not initiate or terminated at an earlier stage of development precluding MS analysis. Based on the uncertainty regarding how many of these eggs underwent partial FP development, the incidence of FP may be even higher than reported here.

The observation of various malformations in several of the FP embryos and hatchlings further supports that genome-wide homozygosity unmasks deleterious alleles. Notable developmental defects included craniofacial abnormalities such as misaligned jaws, agenesis of eyes, missing limbs, and failed abdominal closure (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Only six out of 16 FP animals (37.5%) hatched with no discernable developmental defects (Figure 4—figure supplement 2 A-B). This is in stark contrast to sexually produced animals, where over 98% of hatchlings (n=687) showed no abnormalities. Additionally, most of the defects noted in sexually produced animals were less severe than in FP animals including bulges in tails or truncated digits. While we have not recorded instances of FP animals producing offspring via FP, as described for the whitespotted bamboo shark (Straube et al., 2016), FP A. marmoratus 8450 did produce two eggs while housed in isolation, but these failed to hatch. Analysis of the ovaries of FP animal 8450 as well as germinal vesicles of its FP sister 8449 revealed no differences in structure and anatomy compared to fertile sexually reproducing animals (Figure 4—figure supplement 3).

Putative incidences of FP in wild populations of whiptail lizards

As FP has been associated with captivity in most species where it has been reported, we examined restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) data for wild animals across 15 gonochoristic species (Figure 5). Because RAD-seq is a form of reduced-representation sequencing (Rivera-Colón and Catchen, 2022), we limited further analysis to the 321 individuals that had an average sequencing coverage of at least 20. Computational data analysis revealed five animals (one A. angusticeps and four A. deppii) that had very low levels of heterozygosity at positions of average coverage (<0.05% heterozygous positions). In contrast, the average level of heterozygosity was 0.261% across the dataset, with the highest heterozygosity value at 0.578%. Of the five low heterozygosity animals, A. deppii (ID LDOR30) showed the most striking level of homozygosity affecting all sites but one (Rosner’s Test for Outliers within A. deppii individuals, log-transformation, R=5.127, λ=3.928, p<0.001). This is consistent with the pattern of homozygosity observed with the whole-genome sequencing from FP animals produced in the laboratory. Further fieldwork and analysis will be required to assess the level of FP in natural populations of gonochoristic Aspidoscelis species (and other factors that could influence the observed heterozygosity such as population size, levels of hybridization, and inbreeding). To assess whether all whiptail species can produce viable offspring through FP, larger and broader datasets will be required to compare the incidence of FP between species, especially because animals with developmental defects associated with FP would not have hatched or survived in the wild and would, therefore, not have shown up in the RAD-seq dataset.

Each point is an individual, and percent heterozygosity was calculated only for sites where the coverage is equal to the average sequencing coverage. Five points with black borders indicate individuals (one angusticeps and four deppii) with low levels of heterozygosity. The heterozygosity of Aspidoscelis deppii ID LDOR30 (marked with arrow) is far less than that observed for individuals of the same species (Rosner’s Test for Outliers within deppii individuals, p<0.001), having only one called heterozygous position.

Discussion

In this study, we report over 20 incidences of facultative parthenogenesis in marbled and Arizona striped whiptail lizards. By sequencing and assembling a highly contiguous A. marmoratus genome, we were able to refute automixis as the underlying mechanism in whiptail lizards. Instead, genome-wide homozygosity raises a possibility of a post-meiotic mechanism involving the activation of embryonic development in unfertilized haploid oocytes. Even though FP whiptail lizards are largely comprised of homozygous diploid cells, a fraction of haploid cells persists through development and is readily detectable in young adults. Such mixoploidy and genome-wide homozygosity come at a price. In eight confirmed and 24 suspected cases of FP, development ceased prior to hatching and most FP animals that hatched showed congenital defects. Nevertheless, FP was observed at a rate of 1% and 5% in A. arizonae and A. marmoratus, respectively, and this occurred in the presence of mating partners. Interestingly, these rates are similar to what has been reported for wild populations of two North American pitviper species (Booth et al., 2012). Our findings indicate that FP is far more common in some vertebrate species than previously thought. The purifying selection associated with homozygosity may be an important force in generating additional resilience to counteract the effects of population bottlenecks and inbreeding depression. However, support for this hypothesis is predicated on the fitness and reproduction of FP offspring and, therefore, more long-term studies on seemingly healthy individuals of FP origin are needed.

The start of embryonic development is tightly coupled to fertilization in many vertebrates as the sperm entering the oocyte triggers a signaling cascade that is essential for the completion of female meiosis and initiation of cell division following karyogamy (Sagata, 1996). This process has been mimicked in the laboratory by piercing frog oocytes with a needle to trigger the signal to complete meiosis and initiate replication and division in the haploid oocyte (Le Peuch et al., 1985; Wolf, 1974). In zebrafish, homozygous embryos are routinely generated by fertilization of oocytes with UV-irradiated sperm, a treatment that destroys the paternal DNA (Streisinger et al., 1981). An oocyte treated in this manner will replicate the intact maternal genome in the absence of karyogamy. If the haploid oocyte is then subjected to heat shock treatment, cytokinesis is prevented resulting in a pseudodiploid oocyte that undergoes a second round of DNA replication followed by mitosis. Thus an entirely homozygous diploid embryo starts to develop (Kroeger et al., 2014). In contrast to human intervention forcing two consecutive rounds of DNA replication to occur without intervening mitosis at the start of embryonic development, our data indicate that one or multiple rounds of DNA replication and mitosis take place in some haploid oocytes of whiptail lizards prior to a skipped mitosis yielding a homozygous diploid cell followed by mixoploid development. Initiation of development in a haploid state may be conserved in avian species as unfertilized turkey eggs can yield embryos that contain 40% of haploid cells at blastoderm followed by a reduction to 1.3% within the blood of hatched birds (Cassar et al., 1998). Depending on the tissue and ploidy distribution, the presence of haploid cells may contribute to abnormal development of specific tissues reported here and elsewhere (Ito et al., 1991; Tanaka et al., 2004). Successful embryonic development from haploid cells that restore the diploid state by duplication has also been observed in a stick insect species (Pijnacker, 1969). In whiptail lizards, we have not been able to examine post-meiotic oocytes as locating the post-meiotic nucleus within a large yolked egg is inherently difficult. The difficulty is compounded by the unpredictability of which eggs will undergo FP development and the need to sacrifice animals to remove eggs.

In addition to mixoploidy, genome-wide homozygosity constitutes another obstacle to normal development as each recessive deleterious allele is exposed in either the hemizygous state (haploid cells) or homozygous state (diploid cells). Indeed, arrested development and abnormal phenotypes are observed in FP whiptails, as well as in FP animals across many other species (Booth et al., 2023; Booth and Schuett, 2016; Adams et al., 2023; Olsen, 1973). It is important to note though that some whiptails of FP origin developed normally, much like their sexually produced counterparts. At the population level, FP leads to a precipitous reduction in genetic diversity as only one set of alleles is inherited in the next generation. While FP could be an adaptive trait to bridge population bottlenecks when mate encounters are infrequent, small populations already rely heavily on inbreeding and FP further reduces the size of the gene pool (Watts et al., 2006; Ryder et al., 2021).

While FP can be considered the most extreme example of inbreeding, it is also the most powerful example of genetic purging as it eliminates most deleterious alleles in a single generation. FP in whiptail lizards and other species could, therefore, be considered a reproductive strategy, akin to mixed-mating systems in plants (Goodwillie et al., 2005). The ability to produce offspring via two different strategies provides a level of reproductive assurance in plants (Busch and Delph, 2012). Indeed, we see parallels to this in our own data in which female whiptails have produced offspring via both sexual reproduction and FP on separate occasions or simultaneously within a single clutch. Within plant species with mixed-mating, there are differences between the rates of selfing and outbreeding between populations, and hypotheses as to why these differences occur include limited pollinator visitation and resource availability (Whitehead et al., 2018). To assess whether the co-occurrence of sexual and FP reproduction in vertebrates can indeed be considered a reproductive strategy rather than biological noise will require further studies to assess the reproductive competence and fecundity of offspring produced by either mode of reproduction. To gain a better understanding of the origin and outcomes of FP in whiptail lizards, it will also be important to identify the triggers. It has been proposed that lack of or limited mate encounters triggers FP, but our data in combination with many other reports (Booth et al., 2012; Booth et al., 2014; Kratochvíl et al., 2020; Ryder et al., 2021; Booth et al., 2011; Feldheim et al., 2023; Larose et al., 2023) rejects the idea that this is the key trigger. Recent work identifying key cell cycle genes inducing FP in two species of Drosophila (Sperling et al., 2023) and selection resulting in higher incidences of parthenogenesis in birds (Parker et al., 2010; Olsen, 1975; Olsen et al., 1968) suggest a genetic basis for the initiation of FP.

Our study adds two species of whiptail lizards to a growing list of vertebrates capable of FP and establishes that it occurs alongside sexual reproduction in the presence of males. Using whole-genome sequencing, we demonstrate that post-meiotic genome duplication is the underlying mechanism. One must now consider the possibility that FP is an adaptive trait and that low rates of successful FP could contribute significantly to genome purification. Sexually mature FP offspring will have a low genetic load and only pass on neutral or mildly deleterious alleles to the next generation. However, a role for FP as an adaptive trait hinges on further studies demonstrating the ability of parthenogens to reproduce themselves either through further FP or sexually. If successive reproduction occurs, FP may reduce the frequency of deleterious alleles within a population, as well as provide reproductive assurance when males are scarce. Additional whole-genome sequencing data for species with documented FP will be needed for a better understanding of the genetic basis, propensity, and evolutionary significance of FP.

Microsatellite analysis

DNA was extracted from tail samples for microsatellite genotyping as described in Lutes et al., 2011. PCR products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on a 3730 DNA Analyzer and data was analyzed using GeneMapper (v. 4.0). Primer information can be found in Supplementary file 7.

Genome size estimation

The genome size of A. marmoratus was estimated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACs), in which a standard curve correlating fluorescence intensity of DNA-bound propidium iodide with known genome sizes was generated using cells from fruit flies, zebrafish, and mouse, and then comparing fluorescent intensity with that of erythrocytes from A. marmoratus. Samples were stained using the Sigma PI staining preparation and analyzed on the Influx cytometer. PI fluorescence was collected using the PI Texas red detector with linear amplification and data analysis was performed in FlowJo and Microsoft Excel.

DNA isolation, sequencing, and genome assembly for A. marmoratus

All genome sequencing libraries generated for the purpose of the A. marmoratus genome assembly were derived from the FP animal 8450. The liver tissue was first dissociated in a 10 mL Dounce homogenizer using the tight-fitting pestle and then processed using the Roche gDNA Isolation Kit (#11814770001, MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).

A short insert, high-coverage library was generated using the KAPA HTP kit (KK8234), with 1 µg of gDNA. The resulting library was size selected for fragments between 500–850 bp on a Pippin Prep (Sage Science). Two 40 Kb mate-pair libraries were generated by Lucigen from 1 µg of gDNA using the CviQl and BfaI restriction enzymes, respectively. Each library was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 cycles). An additional three mate-pair libraries were generated, spanning distances of 5 Kb, 8 Kb, and 2–15 Kb, using the Illumina Nextera Mate-Pair Library Prep Kit and 1 µg of gDNA for each. Size selection used the Gel-Plus protocol with Pippin for the 5 and 8 Kb libraries, and the Gel-Free protocol for the 2–15 Kb library. All three libraries were pooled and sequenced on three separate RapidSeq flow cells on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Chicago libraries were prepared at Dovetail Genomics LLC, Santa Cruz, CA, USA from liver tissue to generate read pairs spanning distances up to 140 Kb and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. The combined sequencing data was initially assembled at Dovetail Genomics using Meraculous and their in-house HiRise genome assembly algorithms to generate the A. marmoratus reference genome (AspMar1.0).

Assessing assembly completeness

In order to assess the completeness of the A. marmoratus reference genome, we used BUSCO (v. 3.0.1) (Simão et al., 2015) with the vertebrate_od9 dataset containing 2586 genes, with default parameters apart from changing the BLAST cutoff from 1e-3 to a more stringent value of 1e-6. We used BUSCO numbers generated in Gao et al., 2017 for Shinisaurus crocodilurus and Alligator mississippiensis in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

To perform a phylogenetic analysis, 1333 shared ‘complete’ single-copy orthologs were identified in the genomes of green anole (Anolis carolinensis, anoCar2), cow (Bos taurus, ARS-UCD1.2), dog (Canis lupus familiaris, CanFam3.1), zebrafish (Danio rerio, danRer10), chicken (Gallus gallus, galGal5), human (Homo sapiens, GRCh38.p13), mouse (Mus musculus, GRCm38.p6), medaka (Oryzias latipes, oryLat2), rat (Rattus norvegicus, Rnor_6.0), Argentine black and white tegu (Salvator merianae, HLtupMer3), western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis, Xenopus_tropicalis_v9.1), platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus, X_maculatus-5.0-male). For each amino acid sequence, a multiple sequence alignment was performed with MAFFT (v. 7.305) (Katoh and Standley, 2013). The alignments were concatenated into a supermatrix of 1,112,277 amino acids. Phylogenetic tree topology was estimated using the Maximum Likelihood inference method using the pthreads version of RAxML (v. 8.2.11) and the PROTOGAMMAAUTO model for sequence evolution with 100 bootstrap replicates (Stamatakis, 2014).

Repeat identification

We quantified and annotated the repetitive DNA content within the A. marmoratus genome assembly by using the RepeatMasker pipeline on A. marmoratus scaffolds greater than or equal to 10 Kb in length. We first generated a de novo list of A. marmoratus repetitive elements using RepeatModeler (v. 1.0.11) (Smit and Hubley, 2008). We then used these as input into RepeatMasker (v. 4.0.9) (Smit et al., 2008) using the NCBI/RMBLAST (v. 2.6.0+) search engine. Unclassified repeat element consensus sequences from the RepeatModeler output for each of the three lizards (A. marmoratus, S. merianae, and A. carolinensis) were compared to each other by identifying reciprocal best hits using BLAST (v. 2.9.0+).

Whole-genome sequencing, reference genome alignment, and heterozygosity determination

Genomic DNA isolated from either liver or tail was prepared for sequencing using the KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit (KK8234). Stock adapters were used from the Nextflex kit and barcodes were from BioScientific. All libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Whole-genome sequencing data was aligned to the A. marmoratus reference genome with BWA (v. 0.7.15) (Li and Durbin, 2010) and marked for duplicates with Picard (RRID:SCR_006525; v. 1.119; https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Because samples were sequenced over multiple lanes, the alignment files were merged subsequently, and another round of duplication marking was performed. The alignment files were realigned around small insertions and deletions with GATK (v. 3.5) (DePristo et al., 2011). Data corresponding to lizard ID 122’s bam file was down-sampled to 33% of its original size using seqtk (v. 1.2-r94) to match the expected average genome coverage of the other samples, as this animal was sequenced on one flow cell without multiplexing and, therefore, having much more sequenced reads.

The per position nucleotide profiles for each alignment were then generated using a combination of pysam (RRID:SCR_021017, v. 0.12.0.1) (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam) and pysamstats (Miles, 2015. v. 0.24.3) (https://github.com/alimanfoo/pysamstats) to determine the heterozygosity at any genomic position.

Transcriptome assembly and genome annotation

Two poly-A selected stranded RNA-sequencing libraries were generated with the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (RS-122–2001) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 for the purpose of an A. marmoratus transcriptome assembly. The first library was derived from a blood sample taken from a male animal, and the second library was derived from an embryo incubated at 28 °C and harvested 47–51 days post-egg deposition.

Trinity (v. 2.0.6) (Grabherr et al., 2011) was then used to generate an initial transcriptome assembly. The original reads were aligned to this transcriptome assembly using the Trinity companion script align_and_estimate_abundance.pl. Transcript isoforms with no read support were then filtered out and the remaining assembly was run through seqclean (https://sourceforge.net/projects/seqclean/). Evidence-based annotations for the transcriptome assembly were generated using the MAKER2 pipeline (v. 2.31.8) (Holt and Yandell, 2011). For MAKER2, the entire UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database of proteins (UniProt Consortium, 2018) was used and the Repbase data base was used to mask repeats within the MAKER2 framework (Bao et al., 2015). Assigning putative functions to the gene models was performed using BLAST (v. 2.6.0) and Interproscan (v. 5.13–52.0) (Jones et al., 2014).

Copy number estimation for the Vomeronasal 2 receptor 26 (Vmn2r26) genes was based on aligning the mouse ortholog (http://www.orthodb.org), to the A. marmoratus reference assembly using Exonerate (v. 2.4.0) (Slater and Birney, 2005) with a maximum intron size set to 20 Kb. Genes annotated as Vmn2r26 in the MAKER2 annotations were concatenated and aligned using Geneious (v. 10.1.3) (Geneious Prime, 2017) with default settings. The FastTree plugin (v. 1.0) was used to generate the phylogenetic tree from the alignment with default parameters.

RAD-sequencing analysis

Double digest RAD-sequencing data was derived primarily from previous studies (Barley et al., 2021; Barley et al., 2022b; Barley et al., 2019; Barley et al., 2022a). Fastq files were processed with Stacks (v. 2.62) using process_radtags and then samples from the same species were passed separately using denovo_map.pl. The script executes all the components of the standard Stacks pipeline. The gstacks program of denovo_map.pl calls variants for each position in each locus and assigns it either homozygous, heterozygous, or unknown. Output files were used to calculate the average coverage for each sample. Samples that have at least a coverage of 20 were considered for subsequent analysis. For each passing sample, the heterozygosity was calculated for sites at average coverage by adding up all heterozygous positions and dividing it by the total.

Giemsa staining of erythrocytes

Whole blood was collected aseptically from tails using acid citrate dextrose as an anticoagulant. All samples were prepared immediately after collection. A 5 µL aliquot of the diluted blood sample was used to prepare a blood smear on a 25 × 75 × 1 mm microscope slide. Once dry, the slide was placed in 95% ethanol for 5 min. Giemsa stain (0.4%; Sigma, GS500) was applied liberally to cover the slide every 4 min for a total incubation time of 16 min. The prepared slides were imaged on an Axioplan2 imaging microscope equipped with a plan-apochromat 100 x /1.40 Oil objective and an Axiocam HRc (color) camera (Zeiss). Micromanager (v. 1.4) software was used to acquire the images. The acquired images were then scored visually for the number of haploid, diploid, and binucleated erythrocytes.

Feulgen staining of erythrocytes

Whole blood was collected aseptically from tails using acid citrate dextrose as an anticoagulant. All samples were prepared immediately after collection. A 5 µL aliquot of the diluted blood sample was used to prepare a blood smear on a 25 × 75 × 1 mm microscope slide. Blood smears were treated with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 5 min at RT, then rinsed twice in distilled water. The slides were immersed in 5 M HCl for 30 min at RT, and then rinsed 2 times in distilled water. Slides were then immersed in Schiff’s reagent (Fisher Scientific #SS32-500) at RT for 15–30 min until nuclei were stained. The slides were transferred directly to bisulfite water that was prepared by dissolving 2.5 g of potassium metabisulfite in 500 mL of water and adjusting the pH to 4.0 by the addition of concentrated HCl. The bisulfite wash was repeated three times with 10–15 sec of agitation. The slide was then washed under running tap water for 2 min and dehydrated by incubating in 70% EtOH for 5 min and then 95% EtOH for 5 min. The preparations were cleared in xylene before mounting.

Flow cytometry of erythrocytes

Blood collected from animals was treated as previously described for flow cytometry with modifications: ethanol fixation was performed after RNase treatment and propidium iodide staining was performed overnight, followed by sonication to disrupt aggregate cells (Lutes et al., 2011). A minimum number of 50,000 events were collected for each sample. Flowjo (treestar) was used for data analysis.

Imaging of ovaries and germinal vesicle

Germinal vesicle isolation and acquisition of image stacks by confocal microscopy were performed as described (Lutes et al., 2010). Ovary images were acquired with a Leica M205FA dissection microscope with a planar 0.63 X objective using Micromanager (v. 1.4) software.

Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):

The authors have responded appropriately to my suggestions. There is just one lingering area of concern in lines 209-219. First, the authors refer to defining heterozygous sites as having two alleles supported by the "same" number of reads (changed from "equal"), but what does "same" mean? Presumably it's not the exact same number of reads, because this would exclude all sites with an odd number of reads. So how is "same" defined? An analogous issue applies to the "coverage equal to the mean sequencing depth". What "equal" needs in this context needs to be precisely defined.

Author response
1. General Statements

We thank the three reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive comments. The changes to the text and figures made in response to the questions raised have made this a clearer and stronger manuscript. The additional citations suggested by the reviewers helped to further anchor our study within the growing literature on facultative parthenogenesis. Below we have responded to each comment in blue. We have added new data to the manuscript (Figure 4C, Figure S10B and Figure S10D).

Point-by-point description of the revisions

Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):

1. Summary: Here Ho et al. provide strong molecular evidence for the production of facultatively parthenogenetic whiptail lizards, through a gametic duplication. As evidenced through multiple routes, including microsatellites, WGS, RADseq, and RBC ploidy, and lines of evidence from multiple specimens, this study is timely in furthering our understanding of the mechanisms underlying FP. The findings are conclusive.

That said, I have several comments that should be addressed prior to publication. The introduction which addresses FP in other systems fails to cite several key studies that provide strongly molecular support for terminal fusion automixis. Similarly, the study pushes the idea that this is an adaptive trait, however without proving that the parthenogens can themselves reproduce, this is a moot point at this stage.

That said, my comments are minor. I found this to be an excellent study, well written, comprehensive in methodology, and one that I strongly advocate for publication.

We thank reviewer 1 for referring to our manuscript as an excellent study and strongly advocating for its publication. We concur with his/her points that evidence for automixis in other systems was not sufficiently referenced and that the adaptive trait hypothesis for FP is somewhat speculative. The text has been modified accordingly (see below).

Major comments – None.

Minor Comments: Should be addressed.

Line 36 – However, data that supports terminal fusion are no longer restricted to microsat data. Studies utilizing RADseq and whole-genome sequencing in snakes and crocodiles have now provided further evidence supporting terminal fusion.

See:

Booth et al. 2023. Discovery of facultative parthenogenesis in a new world crocodile. Biology Letters. 19, 20230129.

Card et al. 2021. Genome-wide data implicate terminal fusion automixis in king cobra facultative parthenogenesis. Scientific Reports. 11, 1-9

Allen et al. 2018. Molecular evidence for the first records of facultative parthenogenesis in elapid snakes. R. Soc. Open. Sci. 5, 171901.

We have now included that automixis in other systems is supported by both microsatellite and NGS data in the abstract of our manuscript. The references have been included in the main text.

Ln 42 – Evidence suggesting that isolation from males was not a pre-requisite for FP has previously been reported in snakes.See:

Booth et al. 2011. Evidence for viable, non-clonal but fatherless Boa constrictors. Biology Letters. 7, 253-256.

Booth et al. Facultative parthenogenesis discovered in wild vertebrates. Biology Letters. 8, 983-985.

Booth et al. 2014. New insights on facultative parthenogenesis in pythons. Biol J Linn Soc. 112, 461-468.

Despite the prior evidence to the contrary cited by the reviewer, it is still a commonly held belief among scientists and science journalists that isolation from males promotes or triggers FP. We have placed our findings in the context of other studies, including those mentioned above, that came to the same conclusion that isolation from mating partners is not a requirement for FP. We thank the reviewer for the additional citations, which are now included in the Discussion section.

Ln 48 – Is this really an argument. While an immediate transition to homozygosity will purge some deleterious alleles, given the genome-wide nature of this, there will also conversely have been strong selection for mildly deleterious alleles.

Even though many FP animals have congenital defects, our data, combined with that of others, show that seemingly healthy animals arise as well. Even if these healthy animals harbor slightly deleterious alleles, the most detrimental alleles would have therefore been purged especially for subsequent generations. We have modified the abstract to be clearer: “Conversely, for animals that develop normally, FP exerts strong purifying selection as all lethal recessive alleles are purged in one generation.”

Ln 56 – I would recommend the inclusion of both Allen et al. 2018. R. Soc. Open Sci, and Card et al. 2021. Sci Reports, here, as they are members of the elapids, not represented in the other examples.

These two citations have been added.

Ln 60 – Recent studies have highlighted the significance of sperm storage in reptiles. For example, Levine et al. 2021. Exceptional long-term sperm storage by a female vertebrate. PLos ONE. 16(6).e0252049, describe the storage of sperm by a female rattlesnake for ~70 months, with two instances of its utilization to produce healthy offspring during that period. Clearly, molecular tools are providing both support for long-term sperm storage, and an understanding of its utilization.

Recent work has indeed provided new evidence for instances of long-term sperm storage and the two mechanisms are no longer competing hypotheses, but it is clear that both mechanisms exist in nature. We have modified the text accordingly to include “Nevertheless, clear examples of long-term sperm storage have also been documented in the recent literature (29), underscoring the need for molecular methods such as MS analysis or sequencing data to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.”

Ln 68 – American Crocodile would also be suitable to include here.

This has now been included in the list of examples of endangered species.

Ln71 – The problem with this hypothesis is that parthenogens produced through FP tend to have very low viability. For example, Adams et al. 2023. Endangered Species Research, follow a cohort of sharks produced through FP and all survive. Similarly low levels of survival are reported across other systems for which FP was reported. More likely, FP is simply a neutral trait. The mother is not negatively impacted through producing parthenogens and can go on to produce sexual offspring. Few instances report successful reproduction of a parthenogen. See pers. Comm in Card et al. 2021. And Straube et al. 2016.

We thank the reviewer for the comment and agree that more data on the successful reproduction of parthenotes are needed to claim that FP is an adaptive trait. We have modified the text to include that studies on “the successful reproduction by FP offspring” are needed to support this hypothesis and have included the Straube et al. 2016 citation. We decided to omit the Card et al. 2021 citation as the reports of second-generation FP was through personal communication mentioned in this study and the results themselves have not yet been published.

Ln 79 – I doubt that there is a desperate need for this for conservation. However, I think there is a need to simply further our understanding of basic biological function, given that it is not uncommon, and is phylogenetically widespread in species lacking genomic imprinting.

We agree that understanding FP as a basic biological function is important in light of the realization that it occurs more commonly than previously thought. We have added this aspect to the text: “A better understanding of the triggers and molecular mechanisms underlying FP and the fitness of the resulting offspring are therefore needed in a variety of contexts. These include: to understand a fundamental biological mechanism and its significance in vertebrate evolution, to aid in conservation efforts including captive breeding programs, and to possibly harness FP in an agricultural context (28).”

Ln 85 – It would be worth citing Card et al. 2021., here given that they used genome-wide ddRAD markers to show support for terminal fusion.

The citation has been added.

Ln 91 – Better citations here are Card et al. 2021. Allen et al. 2018, and Booth et al. 2023, which all utilize either RADseq or WGS.

These citations have been added.

Ln 95 – The conclusion of genome duplication here was supported only by a small number of microsatellite loci. As such, given that terminal fusion has been supported through genome-wide markers in other species of snakes and crocodiles, the conclusion of genome duplication is likely incorrect.

In light of the other examples that show terminal fusion in snakes, we have removed this sentence.

Ln 96 – I would strongly disagree with this statement. Allen et al. 2018, Card et al. 2021, Booth et al. 2023, all provide evidence of heterozygous loci and thus support terminal fusion. While no species-specific chromosome level reference genome is available for any of these species, the fact that levels of heterozygosity are below 33% percent supports terminal fusion. Rates over 33% support central fusion, but have not been reported in any vertebrate to date. AS such, I would recommend the removal of this statement.

We agree that the studies listed by the reviewer all support terminal fusion in snakes and crocodiles and therefore, we have removed the statement.

Ln 121 – Recent work in Drosophila mercatorum and D. melanogaster suggest that three genes play a role in the activation of FP in unfertilized eggs. In this case, through the fusion of meiotic products. That said, it is plausible to assume that FP in these lizards has an underlying genomic mechanism that is not related to isolation from males. See Sperling et al. 2023. Current Biology. 33, P3545-P3560.E13.

Clearly isolation from males is not a key trigger in FP in whiptail lizards and other vertebrate species. With recent work from Sperling et al. 2023 and the fact that selection has led to increases in parthenogenesis in birds, an underlying genetic mechanism may well be at play. We have cited and addressed this in the discussion and propose identifying the genetic basis for FP in whiptail lizards in future studies.

“Recent work identifying key cell cycle genes inducing FP in two species of Drosophila (71) and selection resulting in higher incidences of parthenogenesis in birds (24, 33) suggest a genetic basis for the initiation of FP. […] Additional whole-genome sequencing data for species with documented FP will aid in the understanding the genetic basis, propensity, and evolutionary significance of FP.”

Ln 126 – While these data strongly support FP of the two unusual A. marmoratus appearing offspring, can long term sperm storage be ruled out. Either through captive history or allelic exclusion of other males in the group?

We have added the following sentence to the text: “Given that all of these offspring are female, inherited only maternal alleles, and animal 122 had no history of being housed with a conspecific male during its lifetime, both interspecific hybridization and long-term sperm storage are all but ruled out and FP is strongly supported.”

Ln 171 – 191 – Given that the topic of this manuscript is the genomic mechanism underlying FP in this species, are these data necessary? These are not discussed later and as such I would recommend that they are moved supplemental material. Otherwise, they simply clutter that manuscript and detract from the key question. Indeed, they are important to show that the genome constructed is of high quality, but online Supp Mat is the place for that here.

We chose to keep this section in the main text for the following reasons: There is still a lack of published reference quality genomes for many reptile species and therefore we want to highlight that this A. marmoratus reference adds not only to the understanding of FP, but also expands the small list of reptile genomes and makes the first Aspidoscelis genome available to the community. The high quality and contiguity of the genome (as indicated by the high N50 value and BUSCO score) is important to emphasize in the main text because the absence of any heterozygous regions in FP animals supports a mechanism of post-meiotic genome duplication. We would not want to bury these key points in the supplement.

Ln 296 – Comparable estimates were made for parthenogenetic production in wild populations of two North American pitviper species. See Booth et al. 2012. Biology Letters.

In Booth et al. 2012, 2 out of 59 litters of the two pitvipers (3.39%) were identified to contain FP offspring and these results are very similar to our reported rate of FP in whiptail lizards. We have now included this similarity in our discussion. “Interestingly, these rates are similar to what has been reported for wild populations of two North American pitviper species (10)”.

Ln 312 – Again, can this really be suggested? Above, the authors state that most FP animals that hatched had congenital defects, and a large number failed to hatch. This does not sound like strong support for generating individuals that counter the effects of population bottlenecks and inbreeding depression. The authors need to take this study further and monitor the long-term viability of the FP individuals that survive.

We agree with the reviewer that the adaptive advantages of FP reproduction are dependent on the fitness and reproductive potential of FP offspring and present data is insufficient to clearly support this notion. We have modified the text to include that long-term studies are needed to support or refute this hypothesis: “However, support for this hypothesis is predicated on the fitness and reproduction of FP offspring and therefore more long-term studies on seemingly healthy individuals of FP origin are needed.”

Ln 348 – To be able to provide support for this, you need to track animals long term to understand their reproductive competence, and that of their offspring.

We have added the text: “To assess whether the co-occurrence of sexual and FP reproduction in vertebrates can indeed be considered a reproductive strategy rather than biological noise will require further studies to assess the reproductive competence and fecundity of offspring produced by either mode of reproduction.”

Ln 358 – But, the caveat is that the parthenogens must themselves reproduce. This must me stated.

The statement that parthenogens must be able to reproduce to support a hypothesis of FP as an adaptive trait has been added: “One must now consider the possibility that FP is an adaptive trait and that low rates of successful FP could contribute significantly to genome purification. Such a role for FP hinges on further studies demonstrating the ability of parthenogens to reproduce themselves either through further FP or sexually.”

Ln 359 – Note that FP can also fix mildly deleterious alleles. Only if it is strongly deleterious will it be lost.

We now make it clearer that selection only applies to strongly deleterious alleles.

Ln 361 – See above comments.

We have modified the text to include that “FP offspring will have low genetic load and only pass on neutral and mildly-deleterious alleles to the next generation.”

Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):

2. Significance:

While reports of parthenogenesis have been reported as far back as the early 1900's, it has only been over the last decade that reports are become common. Such that facultative parthenogenesis is no longer considered a rarity, but is recognized now as being relatively common and phylogenetically widespread in species that lack genomic imprinting – particularly reptiles, birds, and sharks. Reasons for this are both an increased understanding that the trait can occur, hence recognizing it as an alternative mechanism to long-term sperm storage, and the ease of using molecular approaches.

The fundamental questions of recent times have been understanding the mechanisms driving FP. Recent papers utilizing whole genome sequencing and ddRADseq have provided support for terminal fusion automixis in snakes and sharks. Here, this study provides evidence of gametic duplication in whiptails, a mechanism with an alternative outcome in regards to the levels of retained heterozygosity. As such, this study compares to the recent work of Card et al. 2021 (Scientific Reports), and Booth et al. 2023 (Biology Letters), in providing substantive advances in the field.

The audience for this will be broad. Parthenogenesis is a fascinating topic that attracts significant media attention. See the Altmetric score of recent papers on the topic, particularly Booth et al. 2023 (Altmetric score – ~3100). As such, the study will be of interest to both a broad readership, but will also be of great significance to a specialized group working on parthenogenesis. All round, an excellent paper that has promise to advance the field.

We thank reviewer 1 for this positive assessment and for putting our work into context.

Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):Summary: The researchers bring together microsatellite and whole-genome sequencing data from long-term laboratory cultures of lizards to discover occasional production of parthenogenetic offspring by several species of otherwise sexually producing whiptail lizards ("facultative parthenogenesis, "FP") and to show that these FP-produced lizards have patterns of genomic homozygosity that are incompatible with currently held assumptions about mechanisms of FP. Instead, the FP lizards seem to have been produced by a mechanism that results in almost complete homozygosity, likely a consequence of post-meiotic duplication of genomes from haploid unfertilized oocytes. They also show that FP offspring were produced by females housed with males and along with sexually produced offspring, counter to prevailing assumptions that FP offspring are only produced in situations where mates are not available. Many of the FP-produced offspring did not survive to hatching or had major abnormalities, consistent with a situation where this high homozygosity exposes harmful alleles. Finally, the authors used reduced-representation sequencing (RAD-seq) to survey heterozygosity in 321 wild-collected whiptail lizards from 15 species, showing evidence for strikingly low homozygosity in at least one individual and perhaps up to 5, consistent with the potential for FP in nature. These data are of broad interest in demonstrating several exciting new possibilities. Most importantly, the data hint at a different mechanism of FP than previously assumed, and one that causes immediate near-complete homozygosity. This scenario would likely lead to immediate purging of harmful recessive alleles. If the selective load of this purging wasn't insurmountably high, a lineage with a history of purging could produce FP offspring of relatively high fitness. Other exciting possibilities suggested by the data include the existence of FP even in a setting where mating occurs and in natural populations, versus just captivity.

Major Comments:

I found it difficult to impossible to sort out exactly what the researchers did and with what lizards. For example, in line 107, they refer to a "systematic MS analysis" for all individuals of gonochoristic species in their laboratory, but where are these data? Indeed, at this early spot in the paper, the introduction from here on out suddenly reads like a discussion. What would be better here would be to summarize what was known and wasn't known about the system and questions involved, why gaps in knowledge were important, and what the researchers actually did for this paper. In my opinion, the paper would be a much easier read if the researchers left the results and interpretation for later in the paper.

As a consequence of the reviewers’ comments, the text of the manuscript has undergone major revision, and we trust that reviewer 2 will find this new version far more accessible. The MS data collection of more than 1000 individuals is the subject of another ongoing study and was only mentioned peripherally here to put the identification of FP into context. As most of the MS data relates to gonochoristic reproduction and interspecific hybridization, we are only presenting the data that are directly relevant to this manuscript as part of this study. To our knowledge, there is no common repository to upload raw MS data, but we have provided the data for the FP animals and controls discussed in this paper in the Github repository (see section “Data availability”).

Even with this suggested fix, however, the data are still too inaccessible and analyses too opaque. For example, in line 202, a critical definition is laid out regarding heterozygous sites as those having "equal support" for two alleles. What do the researchers mean by "equal support"? My presumption is that this is something about equal or close to equal numbers of reads, but this definition needs to be spelled out and justified because it underpins much of the downstream analyses. A similar problem occurs in line 208-209, where the authors make a statement about limiting further analysis to positions in the genome where the coverage is "equal" to the mean sequencing depth.

We have changed the text to “we defined heterozygous sites as those having two alleles supported by an equal number of reads. This stringent requirement was chosen to limit the search to apparent heterozygous sites with strong support, decreasing the chance of false positives.”. We further look at only sites where the coverage is equal to the average sequencing depth to exclude regions where over-assembly and collapse of repetitive elements would artificially increase the coverage.

Another data/analysis issue emerges with the components of the manuscript that deal with mixoploidy. As far as I can tell, these data come from one sexually produced lizard, one FP A. marmoratus, and one FP A. arizonae. While the reports of bimodality of nuclear size are certainly interesting, the data and discussion are no more than an anecdotal case study in the absence of careful replication across multiple FP lizards and comparison to sexually produced lizards. Without these data, the conclusion that “Animals produced by facultative parthenogenesis are characterized by mixoploidy” (Figure 4 caption; also see lines 324-331) is far too strong.

We have added animal IDs to figure legends 4 and S10 to clarify that these erythrocyte staining come from two FP A. marmoratus, and one FP A. arizonae. In addition, imaging from two sexually produced control animals (1 A. marmoratus and 1 A. arizonae) have now been included in S10 (as S10B and S10D). We also have included an extra panel of flow cytometry data (new Figure 4C) as a complementary methodology for ploidy determination. Both imaging and flow cytometry support similar amounts of haploid cells. With the additional data and clarification, we hope that the reviewer agrees that the observations of mixoploidy are well beyond “anecdotal”. Nevertheless, we have changed the title for Figure 4 to “Detection of mixoploidy associated with facultative parthenogenesis.” We hope that our observations here will indeed inspire future studies to see if mixoploidy is a widespread phenomenon in FP outside of whiptails as indicated by earlier work in birds.

I had a similar reaction to the discussion of developmental abnormalities and embryonic lethality of embryos of FP origin presented in lines 263-281 (also lines 307-309). What is the baseline level of such abnormalities and the frequency of lethality in sexually produced eggs/embryos/hatchlings, and especially those produced via inbreeding? These comparisons are needed to interpret the significance of the patterns observed in the FP eggs/embryos/hatchings. Analogously, the comparison of the ovaries and germinal vesicles from one FP individual relative to one sexual individual do not tell us anything nearly so definitive as the text in lines 279-281 (also see Figure S12 title, which is too broad of a conclusion for N = 1). This overly ambitious conclusion also underpins the discussion regarding the potentially adaptive nature of FP with respect to genome purification (lines 341-363; also see lines 47-50). If FP does not actually increase the rate of purging in FP lizards relative to inbred sexual counterparts (sounds like inbreeding is common from line 339), it seems less likely that we can view FP as adaptive at least from this perspective.

We have now included a comparison between defects seen in sexually produced animals vs FP animals: “six out of 16 FP animals (37.5%) hatched with no discernable developmental defects (Figure S11A-B). This is in stark contrast to sexually produced animals, where over 98% of hatchlings showed no abnormalities. Additionally, most of the defects noted in sexually produced animals were less severe than in FP animals including bulges in tails or truncated digits.”

We agree that our statement on the lack of differences between sexually produced and FP animals was too general. We have modified the title of Figure S12 from “No differences between ovaries and germinal vesicles of Aspidoscelis marmoratus produced by facultative parthenogenesis or fertilization” to "Ovaries of Aspidoscelis marmoratus FP animal 8450 and germinal vesicles of FP sister 8449 revealed no differences in structure and anatomy compared to fertile sexually reproducing animals.” Due to instant complete homozygosity, FP would indeed have a higher rate of purging than inbreeding. While one hypothesis is that FP is adaptive (in large enough populations), our intentions were to highlight the alternative that FP could be detrimental in smaller populations (that already would likely experience high inbreeding rates). We would expect inbreeding to not be common in whiptails relative to other lizards given that they tend to have large population sizes and actively range across generalist habitats.

A final data concern is with the use of liver tissue for whole-genome sequencing and reference genome assembly (lines 389-390) and then using these data and the reference genome to make conclusions about ploidy/coverage. Liver tissue is very commonly endopolyploid, meaning that coverage could be artificially high for animals for which liver (vs. tail) tissue was used for DNA extraction. In particular, it would be helpful if the researchers consider whether endopolyploidy could have affected their ability to make accurate estimation of coverage and thus, heterozygosity, when libraries generated from diploid (tail) tissues are aligned to a reference genome generated from a polyploid tissue as was done here.

This is an interesting point and indeed hepatic cells in various organisms have been documented to be polyploid. The proportion of polyploid cells though vary and as far as we are aware, all published studies on polyploid hepatocytes are in mammals (DOI: 10.1016/j.tcb.2013.06.002). Reference genomes have been generated from a variety of tissue sources and liver is commonly used. As most assemblies are for haploid genomes, polyploidy (unlike aneuploidy) does not impact the assembly quality. The reference genome was also from an animal of FP origin and therefore has genome-wide homozygosity that aids in a more contiguous genome assembly by eliminating the phasing problem. For the 10 animals sequenced, genomic DNA was derived from liver for three animals and the rest from tail tissue. The sequencing data generated from either liver or tail resulted in similar coverage levels (Figure S6) and similar levels of heterozygosity (Figure 2A).

Minor Comments:

Line 410: Please explain why the BLAST cutoff was changed from the default.

The BLAST cutoff was changed from the default 1e-03 to 1e-06 to be more stringent and thereby increase confidence in the BUSCO results.

Lines 441-443: Please explain why this dataset was seemingly larger than expected.

Animal 122 was sequenced on one flow cell without any multiplexing with other samples and therefore yielded more reads than other animals sequenced. We subsampled the reads from this animal for analysis, so it is directly comparable with the other WGS data.

Figure 1, and other figures featuring comparisons of MS data across parents and offspring: The authors need to engage here with the alleles that do not match either parent here (e.g., allele 282 at MS7), explaining the likelihood that these alleles indeed represent a binning error (or, perhaps, stepwise mutation from parental allele), and these alleles should be flagged. Instead, they bin these unique alleles with the most similar parental allele without any explanation or flagged. The authors do bring this point up in Figure S1, but this issue needs to be addressed in the main text (related point: the mix of red/green in MS16 offspring appear more green than red. Is this meant to denote a probability different than 50:50? If not, the authors should adjust the shading so that this shape is half green, half red).

We have added to the figure legend that single nucleotide differences are most likely binning errors and are therefore not considered “de novo” alleles. Instead, they are assigned it to the most similar parental allele, consistent with Figure S1. The shading at MS16 has been removed so that it is consistent with Figure 3.

Figure 3: Indicate that white background for alleles means that allelic inheritance is not determinable, or use the mix of colors applied in Figure 1 to indicate as such. Unique offspring alleles should be flagged rather than just automatically assigned to the most similar parental allele. Finally, it would be helpful if the alleles were presented within loci from the shorter to the longer alleles.

We have included in the figure legend that non-shaded alleles are those for which multiple potential parents share the same allele and the inheritance therefore remains ambiguous for this locus. Single nucleotide differences are also now addressed, and sizes are ordered from smallest to largest.

Figure S7. Indicate visually which panels indicate FP animals.

We have now indicated which animals are FP and included this in Figure S6 as well.

Figure S13. The 5 animals that had especially low heterozygosity should be flagged. The title of this figure should be toned down in light of the tentative nature of the conclusions regarding FP in nature: low heterozygosity could instead reflect, for example, a long history of inbreeding. My reaction to the data is also that the % heterozygosity distribution for many of the species looks continuous rather than the bimodality one might expect under FP vs. sexual reproduction.

Since FP has not been further confirmed in these animals, unlike those examples from our captive colony, there could indeed be other reasons for low heterozygosity. We have changed the title of the figure from “Facultative parthenogenesis in whiptail lizards collected in nature” to the more neutral “Heterozygosity estimates of whiptail lizards collected in nature.” Since there are so relatively few animals, one would not necessarily expect a bimodal distribution to be apparent in the current data. We did show that the animal with the lowest calculated level of heterozygosity (deppii LDOR30) was a statistical outlier when compared to other individuals of the same species though. Since these animals were sampled across different locations and habitats, the effective population sizes would be assumed to be different as well, reflecting the range of heterozygosity estimates seen here. This has been made clear in the text.

Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):General assessment: strengths and limitations. The paper's strengths include the combination of data from lab and natural populations, the characterization of an unexpected means of achieving FP, with dramatic genetic consequences, and the data suggesting that this type of FP is fairly common and occurs even in the context of mating.

Audience: The biological questions of relevance to these discoveries are of broad interest, and the paper is likely to garner some attention from the life sciences community as whole and the popular press.

Advance: These data fill an important knowledge gap regarding the mechanisms potentially driving FP in vertebrates, how often FP is likely to occur, and its genetic consequences. The discoveries are potentially conceptual/fundamental, though the extent to which they are ground breaking is not clear in the absence of functional characterization of how FP occurs as well as the need for more rigorous comparisons and replication that I outlined above.

We thank reviewer 2 for summarizing the strengths of this manuscript, pointing out the broad interest and stating that this work fills an important knowledge gap.

Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):

Summary:

The occurrence of facultative parthenogenesis has been described in a number of vertebrate lineages but the underlying cytological mechanism(s) have remained largely speculative due to sparsity of data. Here, Ho & Tormey et al. provide a detailed analysis of facultative parthenogenesis in gonochoristic species of the lizard genus Aspidoscelis. They show that parthenogenesis leads to a complete loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within a single generation. They attribute the LOH to diploidization through duplication of the oocytes haploid genome after completion of meiosis. This mechanism is consistent with their finding of mixoploidy in erythrocytes of asexually produced offspring. Based on LOH the authors additionally show that facultative parthenogenesis in Aspidoscelis is not condition dependent (no developmental switch): it can occur in the presence of males, alongside with sexual reproduction in the same clutch, and both in captivity and the wild. Finally, the authors show that facultative parthenogenesis is associated with developmental aberrations, likely caused by expression of homozygous recessive deleterious mutations.

Major comments:

In my opinion, this study presents a very comprehensive, careful documentation of mechanistic aspects and consequences of facultative parthenogenesis in a vertebrate. The genomic and microsatellite results leave little to no doubt that facultative parthenogenesis has led to complete LOH in Aspidoscelis. I am particularly impressed by the meticulous analysis of genomic coverage to exclude e.g. false positive heterozygosity due to merged paralogs in the assembly. I also follow the authors conclusion that a post-meiotic "gamete duplication"-like mechanism is likely causative for the LOH (and the mixoploidy of erythrocytes; but I am no expert on that). I was wondering if terminal fusion automixis together with a complete absence of recombination would be worth mentioning as an (probably very unlikely) alternative in the discussion. It would be exciting to corroborate the conclusion of diploidization by genome duplication in the future, e.g. via early embryonic DNA stainings to show the duplication "in action" (if that is practically possible)…? As for this manuscript, I suggest emphasizing the indirect nature of the evidence for the mechanism of parthenogenesis a little bit more.

We thank the reviewer for highlighting the effort that went into the genomic analysis that led us to our conclusions. In terms of terminal fusion without recombination, we argue that this is not an obvious alternative explanation as a large body of work has established that at least one crossover per homologous chromosome pair is required to advance into meiosis I in many organisms (e.g. see https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.681123) and therefore the absence of recombination would likely not produce the polar bodies necessary for automixis.

We have added to the text: “In whiptail lizards, we have not been able to examine post-meiotic oocytes as locating the post-meiotic nucleus within a large yolked egg is inherently difficult. The difficulty is compounded by the unpredictability of which eggs will undergo FP development and the need to sacrifice animals to remove eggs.”

While the genome duplication mechanism we propose is indeed indirect because we are unable to visualize developing FP embryos, the most parsimonious explanation from the whole-genome sequencing analysis is genome duplication because of the lack of heterozygous regions associated with automixis. In the text, we have made sure to state genome-wide homozygosity as the basis for our conclusion.

I agree that facultative parthenogenesis in the presence of males hints at a baseline rate of parthenogenesis without requiring a developmental switch. However, this makes it difficult to rule out that sperm played a role in activation of embryonal development (gynogenesis; however I am only aware of gynogenesis in fishes and amphibians)… maybe, the authors want to take this up in the discussion. Were the five parthenogenetic individuals for whole genome sequencing actually produced in the presence of males, too?

FP has been reported to occur in isolated females for other reptile and bird species, suggesting that sperm activation is at least not a general requirement in FP of amniotes. (Watts, et al. 2006, W. W. Olsen, S. J. Marsden 1954). In all cases in this study, the female mothers were housed with conspecific or heterospecific males. While we cannot completely rule out a non-genetic contribution of sperm in these cases, it would seem to be an unlikely explanation in light of the sperm-independent reproduction by obligate parthenogenesis in other species of whiptail lizards (unlike the sperm-dependence of all unisexual reproduction in amphibians and fish). We decided to not include speculation on sperm-dependence in this manuscript as we have no evidence in favor of it, nor is there any evidence for this in the literature relating to other amniotes. In fact, most examples of FP were reported from isolated females, most likely because offspring were not expected in those cases and prompted further analysis as to their origin.

I agree with the interpretation of the LOH in the RADseq data as a likely case of facultative parthenogenesis in the wild. However, when looking at figure S13 I noticed some bimodal looking distributions (e.g. in A. guttatus). It may be interesting for future studies to look into what factors influence heterozygosity in natural populations of Aspidoscelis (e.g. inbreeding vs parthenogenesis). Could there be different mechanisms of facultative parthenogenesis in different Aspidoscelis species explaining different LOH intensities?

The continuous nature of the data may reflect natural variation between individuals and collection at various locations with possibly different effective population sizes and levels of hybridization. Low levels of heterozygosity could be indicative of inbreeding or FP in some cases. This is important to note in future studies and we have added this to the manuscript (“Further fieldwork and analysis will be required to assess the level of FP in natural populations of gonochoristic Aspidoscelis species (and other factors that could influence the observed heterozygosity such as population size, levels of hybridization, and inbreeding) …”). While there are different mechanisms of FP in other vertebrate groups, the most parsimonious hypothesis is that within a genus, the mechanism would be the same.

The manuscript is well written, the introduction nicely explains the significance of the study, the methods are fully appropriate and the results (and supplementary results) displayed comprehensibly and in great detail. The discussion might benefit from going a bit more generally into the occurrence and mechanism of obligate asexuality in Aspidoscelis. One might e.g. speculate on whether the ability for facultative parthenogenesis in gonochoristic species has facilitated the transitions to obligate parthenogenesis in the hybrid lineages and what peculiarities might predispose Aspidoscelis to parthenogenesis (e.g. are centrioles contributed by sperm required?). In addition, I think the occurrence of LOH due to gamete duplication (facultative and obligate) in invertebrates (e.g. due to Wolbachia) is worth mentioning in the discussion: e.g. there is a similar case in facultative asexual Bacillus rossius stick insects, where the early dividing cells are haploid. Some of them diploidize via duplication later and form the embryo.

Thank you for complimenting each section of the manuscript and referring to it as well-written. Our lab has a long-standing interest in obligate parthenogenesis. While it is interesting that both obligate and facultative parthenogenesis occur alongside each other in this genus, the mechanisms appear to be fundamentally different, and we would like to focus the discussion on FP in a variety of systems and its potential implications in conservation and evolution. Parthenogenesis in general is a fascinating topic for a broad audience and not discussing another form of parthenogenesis (obligate in this case), the focus remains on FP and keeps the manuscript more accessible for non-specialists. We have included the stick insect as another example of diploid restoration through genome duplication in the discussion.

Minor comments:

39-41: I am a bit puzzled by the usage of the term "post-meiotic" to contrast the diploidization through duplication with automixis. Wouldn't one consider polar body fusion after completion of meiosis II also post-meiotic? Maybe I am just not aware of how the term is usually used in this context here…

We use the term “post-meiotic” because the restoration of an entirely homozygous diploid cell can only occur after the completion of both meiotic divisions. It is our understanding that polar body fusion and meiotic restitution after meiosis I or meiosis II are generally considered meiotic mechanisms in the specialized literature, even though polar body fusion would also occur after the meiotic divisions.

65: isn't that gynogenesis (sperm-dependent parthenogenesis) in the amazon molly?

While sperm is required for parthenogenesis in the Amazon Molly, it is an all-female species that exclusively reproduces through gynogenesis. In this case, it is considered an example of obligate parthenogenesis rather than FP.

78: the term "economically viable" may be a bit puzzling for a biologist's audience. "Economically sustainable" could be an alternative.

This has been changed.

129: the Arizona male was referred to as ID 4272 above. Here it is ID 4238?

This has been corrected. The correct ID is 4272.

218: please define over-assembly (see line 207)

The definition of “over-assembly” is collapsing paralogous loci into a single representative sequence. This is now explained in the text.

263-281: please, indicate a hatching rate/ rate of malformations of sexually produced offspring for comparison.

A comparison has been added: “This is in stark contrast to sexually produced animals, where over 98% of hatchlings had no abnormalities noted.”

333: in the haploid cells recessive deleterious mutations would be exposed in the hemizygous state but in the diploid cells in the homozygous state.

The text has been modified to reflect the difference between haploid and diploid cells.

470: please, provide more detail for the RADseq analyses (variant calling, calculation of heterozygosity etc.)

We have elaborated on the analysis in the methods.

Figure 1B: please, mention in the legend that the shown mechanisms are not exhaustive, e.g. first polar body fusion could occur right after meiosis 1 or polar body formation could be skipped completely.

This has been added.

Figure 1C: it may be interesting for non-specialists to name the distinctive morphological characters setting apart the three species in the figure legend and highlight them e.g. with arrows in the figure.

We have now included in the figure legend characteristic color patterns for each species: “(C) Photographs of Aspidoscelis arizonae with characteristic blue ventral coloration (top), A. gularis with light spots in dark fields that separate light stripes on dorsum (middle), and A. marmoratus with light and dark reticulated pattern on dorsum (bottom).” Since the descriptions are specific and apparent, we did not add arrows to the pictures.

Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):

Significance: The study by Ho & Tormey et al. substantially enhances the understanding of (facultative) asexuality in vertebrates. In particular, while most reports of facultative parthenogenesis in vertebrates have been attributed to a form of automixis, the authors conclusively show an instance of diploidization through genome duplication, a mechanism functionally similar to "gamete duplication". The study is novel, very comprehensive and of interest for a general audience within the field of evolutionary biology.

We thank reviewer 3 for pointing out that our study substantially enhances the understanding of asexuality in vertebrates, is very comprehensive and of interest for a general audience within the field of evolutionary biology.

[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]

Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):

The authors have responded appropriately to my suggestions. There is just one lingering area of concern in lines 209-219. First, the authors refer to defining heterozygous sites as having two alleles supported by the "same" number of reads (changed from "equal"), but what does "same" mean? Presumably it's not the exact same number of reads, because this would exclude all sites with an odd number of reads. So how is "same" defined? An analogous issue applies to the "coverage equal to the mean sequencing depth". What "equal" needs in this context needs to be precisely defined.

We have addressed the remaining comment from reviewer #2 in the text as follows:

“…we defined heterozygous sites as those covered by an even number of reads with two alleles supported by the same number of reads. Sites covered by an odd number of reads were filtered out for this initial analysis…” (lines 205-107).

Furthermore, we provide an example of “coverage equal to the mean sequencing depth” to further enhance clarity: “Based on this observation, we limited further analysis to positions in the genome where the coverage is equal to the mean sequencing depth (as defined by rounding the mean sequencing coverage value to the next even integer). For example, for animal 003, the average sequencing coverage is 18.31 (Figure 2-supplement 5A) and we only considered sites with a coverage of 20 (Figure 2-supplement 6A)” (lines 213-216). We hope this will sufficiently clarify the approach for reviewer 2 and other readers.
