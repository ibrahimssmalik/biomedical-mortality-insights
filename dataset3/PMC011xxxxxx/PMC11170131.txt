Abstract

Whole-genome reconstruction of bacterial pathogens has become an important tool for tracking transmission and antimicrobial resistance gene spread, but highly accurate and complete assemblies have largely only historically been achievable using hybrid long- and short-read sequencing. We previously found the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) R10.4/kit12 flowcell/chemistry produced improved assemblies over the R9.4.1/kit10 combination, however long-read only assemblies contained more errors compared to Illumina-ONT hybrid assemblies. ONT have since released an R10.4.1/kit14 flowcell/chemistry upgrade and recommended the use of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) during library preparation, both of which reportedly increase accuracy and yield. They have also released updated basecallers trained using native bacterial DNA containing methylation sites intended to fix systematic basecalling errors, including common adenosine (A) to guanine (G) and cytosine (C) to thymine (T) substitutions. To evaluate these improvements, we successfully sequenced four bacterial reference strains, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and nine genetically diverse E. coli bloodstream infection-associated isolates from different phylogroups and sequence types, both with and without BSA. These sequences were de novo assembled and compared against Illumina-corrected reference genomes. In this small evaluation of 13 isolates we found that nanopore long-read-only R10.4.1/kit 14 assemblies with updated basecallers trained using bacterial methylated DNA produce accurate assemblies with ≥40×depth, sufficient to be cost-effective compared with hybrid ONT/Illumina sequencing in our setting.

pmcImpact Statement

Currently, the best method of building accurate and complete bacterial genome assemblies is to create a hybrid assembly, i.e. combining information from both long and short sequencing reads. Short-reads are highly accurate but can be difficult to assemble into a complete genome because they do not effectively span repetitive sequences. Long-reads have traditionally been less accurate, but help in determining genome structure. By combining long- and short-reads, we get high accuracy and complete structural information. However, this also involves multiple sequencing platforms and more resource than using a single-sequencing platform. In this study, we compare long-read-only assemblies using Oxford Nanopore Technology’s (ONT) updated chemistry and software to hybrid Illumina-Nanopore assemblies. We sequenced four bacterial pathogens with published reference genomes (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli) and 12 bloodstream infection-associated E. coli isolates, and show that assemblies from the latest technology are able to compete with hybrid Illumina-Nanopore assemblies in their quality, representing a significant step i n bacterial genome assembly using ONT data only.

Introduction

Generating high-quality whole-genome de novo assemblies for bacterial pathogens has become an important tool supporting diagnostic, infection prevention control and public health initiatives, improving our understanding of antimicrobial resistance and pathogen epidemiology [1]. The introduction of longer sequencing reads from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has enabled the reconstruction of previously difficult-to-assemble genomes. Previously we have found the most cost-effective method of assembling high-accuracy bacterial genomes is to combine long R9.4.1/kit10 ONT reads with high-accuracy short Illumina reads [2]. Generating these high-quality assemblies without the need for Illumina sequencing could reduce costs and laboratory time, and this would enable more cost-effective, faster, and higher-throughput sequencing.

ONT have iteratively updated their flowcell technology and chemistry from R9.4.1/kit10 through R10.3/kit12 to R10.4/kit12 and most recently R10.4.1/kit14; older flowcells and chemistries have been phased out. Further changes to ONT workflows have included an increase in sampling rate on the nanopore devices from 4 k samples per second to 5 kHz, which generates more data points for basecalling and thereby improves accuracy, according to ONT [3]. Users of R10.4 have reported cytosine to thymine (C-to-T) and guanine to adenine (G-to-A) errors, hypothesized to be caused by methylated sites confusing the basecalling models. ONT have released updated basecalling models trained with native bacterial DNA and designed to fix errors associated with methylated sites, which also takes advantage of the increased sampling rate. It is now also recommended to use bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is added during library preparation to improve sequencing yield and quality by blocking non-specific binding sites.

We have previously compared ONT-only assemblies using R10.3 or R10.4 sequencing data to the R9.4.1/Illumina hybrid assemblies [4]. We looked at four common, diverse human pathogenic reference strains representing a range of %GC content, namely, Staphylococcus aureus MRSA252, Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH78578, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, and Escherichia coli CFT073. R10.4-only assemblies (using superior accuracy [sup] basecalling) looked promising in terms of genome reconstruction, error rates and gene recovery, but generally required deeper long-read sequencing depths than for a hybrid assembly, rendering the latter more cost-effective and high-throughput if access to both ONT and Illumina sequencing modalities was available [4]. Smaller plasmids (<5 kb) were also less effectively recovered as part of long-read-only sequencing. These findings have been consistent with other more recent studies [56].

As an update to our previous evaluation, here we compare the accuracy of assemblies from nanopore-only R10.4.1 sequencing with our previous hybrid R9.4.1/Illumina assemblies for the same four species references. Given that E. coli was the most challenging species to assemble previously, we also evaluate the accuracy of R10.4.1-only assemblies for 12 E. coli strains representing major phylogroups of the species compared with R9.4.1/Illumina hybrids created for these E. coli strains. As part of this second evaluation, we characterize the impact of BSA on sequencing output, the impact of increased sampling rate and the newer basecalling models on read and assembly accuracy, and estimate current sequencing costs per isolate using R10.4.1 long-read-only assembly.

Methods

Bacterial isolates and DNA extraction

DNA was extracted from laboratory stocks of four bacterial reference strains: P. aeruginosa PAO1, S. aureus MRSA252, K. pneumoniae MGH78578, E. coli CFT073, and 12 bloodstream-associated E. coli isolates, for which we had existing Illumina data [7] and which were chosen to reflect the genetic diversity within the species based on in silico phylotyping [8]. Stocks were stored at −80 °C in nutrient broth with 10 % glycerol. Stocks were cultured on Columbia Blood Agar overnight at 37 °C. One colony was selected and sub-cultured for DNA extraction using the QIAGEN Genomic Tip 100 G−1 kit. Extracts were stored in elution buffer at 4 °C for the duration of the study. DNA quality was assessed with the Qubit Fluorometer and TapeStation immediately after extraction, and periodically prior to sequencing thereafter.

Nanopore sequencing

All sequencing occurred on an ONT GridION device (Minknow version 23.04.5) using a 5 kHz sampling rate with R10.4.1 flow cells. Sequencing libraries were created using the Rapid Barcoding (RBK114.96) kit, and each run was set for 72 h.

For the four reference strains, we followed the recommendation to use BSA (50 mg ml−1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2616) as part of library preparation and created a multiplexed library using the four reference strains, which was run on a single R10.4.1 flowcell. The yield for K. pneumoniae on this run was too low (10.8 Mb only), so this extract was sequenced again as a single sample on a second R10.4.1 flowcell. To specifically assess the impact of adding BSA to the flowcell priming mix, a multiplexed library of the 12 E. coli isolates was created, and split between two R10.4.1 flowcells. One of these flowcells included the addition of BSA to the flowcell priming mix, and the other did not. Sampling rates, basecalling and runtimes were as above.

R9.4.1 data were generated previously [4].

Illumina sequencing

Illumina sequencing data for the reference strains were generated previously as part of [4], and for the 12 E. coli isolates as part of [7].

A summary of the experimental workflow is shown in Fig. S1, available in the online version of this article.

Generating high-quality reference genomes for comparisons

Species reference strains

Historically deposited reference sequences may contain ambiguous nucleotide codes (e.g. R [A or G], Y [C or T], W [A or T] or K [G or T]; IUPAC) and long-term storage of frozen stocks of reference isolates may lead to genuine genetic changes, particularly in the tRNA and 23S/16S rRNA regions (Figs S2–S4). Therefore, for this study we generated reference genome sequences de novo for the reference strains of E. coli CFT073 (AE014075.1), K. pneumoniae MGH78578 (CP000647.1), P. aeruginosa PAO1 (NC_002516.2), S. aureus MRSA252 (NC_002952.2) by assembling Illumina sequence data from [8] and R9.4.1 nanopore data from [4] using Trycycler [9] (version 0.5.4) and following the default workflow, with assembly inputs from flye [10] (version 2.9.3-b1797), miniasm [11] (version 0.3-r179), and raven [12] (version 1.8.3). Contigs were ONT polished with medaka (version 1.6.0; default settings; https:// github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) and Illumina polished with polypolish [13] (version 0.6.0) and POLCA [14] (version 4.1.1). The R9.4.1 nanopore data was used to generate a reference sequence independently of the experimental R10.4.1 data being considered in this study. Notably however, Trycycler was unable to resolve the five plasmid sequences present in the K. pneumoniae reference and therefore Illumina-corrected (using sequence data from [8] and the SNIPPY workflow [version 4.6.0; https://github.com/tseemann/snippy]), versions of the original plasmid sequences (CP000648.1, CP000649.1, CP000650.1, CP000651.1, CP000652.1) were used in the comparison.

E. coli isolates

For the 12 clinical E. coli isolates where no gold standard reference genomes are publicly available, hybrid Illumina/nanopore assemblies were generated as references using R9.4.1/Illumina data with Unicycler (v0.5.0, default settings, except G_117, E_8318 where flye assemblies were used instead of miniasm within Unicycler) [15]. Trycycler was not used as it required too much manual intervention to resolve the genomes and the difference noted for three of nine cases where it was evaluated to be minimal (zero SNVs or INDELs for B1_2599, ten for E_831, and two for F_624 compared to R9.4.1/Illumina hybrids assembled with Unicycler). The Unicycler reference assemblies were compared to R10.4.1 long-read-only assemblies for the same isolates, generated using the optimal strategy developed on the four mixed species reference strains, namely Dorado v0.5.3 basecalling +Flye assembly with a single round of Medaka polishing.

Sequence data processing and comparisons with reference sequences

An analysis workflow was written in nextflow and is publicly available in gitlab (https://gitlab.com/ModernisingMedicalMicrobiology/assembly_comparison).

Basecalling

Raw R9.4.1 nanopore data from [8] was re-basecalled using guppy version 5.0.12+eb1 a981 with the dna_r9.4.1_e8.1_sup.cfg model. R10.4.1 nanopore raw data was basecalled using either Dorado version 0.4.0+0aaf16d and dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.2.0 (Dorado_0.4.0) or Dorado version 0.5.3+d9af343 and dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.3.0 (Dorado_0.5.3) models, which included the methylation aware basecalling models (v4.3) released in Dorado version 0.5.0 (https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado/releases/tag/v0.5.0).

Comparisons with reference sequences

Per read accuracy, subsampling, assembly, contig reference comparison and gene recovery metrics were all evaluated as described previously [4].

For empirical read accuracy, reads were mapped to the hybrid ONT-Illumina trycycler assembled reference sequences with minimap2 [16] (version 2.22-r1101) and samtools [17], and the percentage identity was calculated from the query distance (NM tag) in the bam file over the query length, multiplied by 100. Empirical Q-scores were not shown due to the number of reads with no errors resulting in infinite values that skewed the results.

For R10.4.1 long-read-only assemblies, nanopore reads for each species reference strain or clinical E. coli isolate were subsampled (20 to 100×depths at 10×intervals) using Rasusa (v0.6.1) [18], then assembled with Flye [10] (using the --meta and –nano-hq parameters, version 2.9-b1768) along with the un-subsampled reads (represented in figures as ‘0’). Medaka (1.6.0; default settings; https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) was used to polish the assembled contigs from Flye. Only one polishing iteration was used as further polishing cycles did not improve error rates and used significant compute resource (Fig. S5 [also shown in our previous evaluation [4]]).

To evaluate if hybrid assembly represented an advantage over R10.4.1 long-read-only assembly, the four species reference strains were hybrid assembled with nanopore and Illumina sequences using Unicycler (v0.5.0, default settings) [15]. Hybrid assemblies were generated with both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 nanopore data for comparison. The nanopore reads were subsampled to specific depths but the complete quantity of Illumina reads was always used.

Assembly error profiling

The error types from the assembled contigs were characterized using the output from DNADIFF (Mummer3 package [19]) and summarized based on type insertion or deletion (INDEL) and single nucleotide differences (SNV).

Statistical analysis and visualizations

Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (two-sample Wilcoxon) tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of pairwise differences in continuous non-normal variables such as read length and accuracy for each sequencing modality. Statistical analysis and data visualizations were carried out in R version (version 4.3.0) using the ggpubr and ggplot packages, and Fig. S1. was generated in Biorender (www.biorender.com).

Results

Four bacterial species reference strains: sequencing yield and read length distributions

The R9.4.1 flowcell generated more data than the combined R10.4.1 flowcells after running for 72 h, (10.5 Gb versus 5.2 Gb, Fig. S6 and Table 1). The data generated for the two R10.4.1 results and plotted originate from the same combined read yields from two flowcells (as K. pneumoniae was re-sequenced separately) but differ by basecalling method (Dorado_0.4.0 versus Dorado_0.5.3), resulting in slightly different total base outputs (Fig. S6).

Median read lengths varied between species for each run type with R9.4.1 having the highest median and IQR lengths across all species (median read length for R9.4.1 : 6.5 kb [IQR: 2.68–15.2 kb] versus for R10.4.1 : 1.7 kb [IQR: 0.34–7.73 kb]; P<0.001, two-sample Wilcoxon) (Fig. S7).

Four bacterial species reference strains: empirical read accuracy

The empirical accuracy of the raw reads was determined from alignments to the hybrid Illumina/ONT Trycycler reference genomes (chromosomes only). Of the long-read methods, the R9.4.1 reads had the lowest accuracy (median: 96.8 % [IQR: 95.9–97.4 %]) compared with R10.4.1 reads (median: 98.8 %, [IQR: 98.1–99.2 %], P<0.001, two-sample Wilcoxon) 94 %; Fig. 1. The modal accuracies ranged from 97–97.5 % for R9.4.1 and increased to >99 % for the R10.4.1 reads. Reads basecalled using Dorado 0.5.3 showed higher read-level accuracies compared to the Dorado 0.4.0 data (median: 99.2 % [IQR: 98.8–99.5 %] vs median: 98.7 %, [IQR: 97.8–99.5 %], P<0.001, two-sample Wilcoxon).

Four bacterial species reference strains: assembly chromosome and plasmid recovery

The R10.4.1 nanopore-only (Flye and medaka) and R10.4.1+Illumina hybrid (Unicycler) approaches all fully assembled the reference chromosome sequences into single contigs at all subsampled sequencing depths, Fig. 2. The R9.4.1+Illumina hybrid (Unicycler) approach reconstructed the E. coli chromosome as two contigs (as opposed to a fully resolved, single contig) at 30x and 40× subsampled depths but completely resolved the reference strain chromosomes at all other depths (Fig. 2).

Faceted columns represent subsampling to a specified depth (x coverage), with 0 the full number of reads from the run used. Faceted rows represent run type, including the flowcell cell used (R9.4.1 or R10.4.1), the basecaller used (Guppy or dorado), and the assembly strategy used (Flye+Medaka or Unicyler) Unicycler assemblies represent Nanopore–Illumina hybrid assemblies.

Plasmid recovery for most long-read-only assemblies was affected by either higher sequencing depth (i.e. impaired at >100×depth for R9.4.1 guppy/sup basecalled and R10.4.1 dorado_0.4.0 basecalled data) or at <30×sequencing depth (for R10.4.1 dorado_0.5.3 basecalled data), but was otherwise excellent (Fig. 3). Both R9.4.1+Illumina and R10.4.1+Illumina hybrid assemblies also resulted in excellent plasmid recovery with long-read sequencing depths of 20×–100×.

Four bacterial species reference strains: assembly accuracy

Comparing the assembled contigs to the species reference genomes using dnadiff, the number of INDELs and SNV errors/100 kb was calculated (Figs 4 and S7; Table S1). Hybrid assemblies using R9.4.1+Illumina or R10.4.1+Illumina data had some of the lowest indel and SNV error rates, largely unaffected by long-read sequencing depth. Long-read-only assembly using R9.4.1 data (grey line, Fig. 4) had the highest number of indel errors ranging between 1 and >10 indels/100 kb, with some effect of increased sequencing depth in reducing this error rate. R10.4.1 long-read-only assemblies using data basecalled with the Dorado 0.5.3 (blue line, Fig. 4) consistently had the lowest indel and SNV error rates amongst long-read-only assemblies and for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus, these were lower than the hybrid assemblies.

Colours represent run type, including the flowcell cell used (R9.4.1 or R10.4.1), the basecaller used (Guppy or dorado), and the assembly strategy used (Flye+Medaka or Unicycler). Unicycler assemblies represent Nanopore–Illumina hybrid assemblies.

Indel rates were notably highest for R9.4.1 long-read only assemblies, and predominantly biassed to A and T deletions, except for P. aeruginosa, which notably has a high %GC content. These biases were less marked with R10.4.1 long-read-only assemblies, with much lower indel rates. At a SNV level, G-to-A and C-to-T SNV errors appeared systematically more frequent across most sequencing/basecalling/assembly approaches and for most species; for R10.4.1 long-read-only assemblies these were reduced by using the Dorado 0.5.3 basecaller (Fig. 5).

Unicycler assemblies represent Nanopore–Illumina hybrid assemblies.

Compared to the coding sequences (CDS) annotated in the hybrid trycycler-assembled reference genomes, CDS content recovery was excellent for long-read-only assemblies using R10.4.1 data and the Dorado 0.5.3 model (i.e. above 99 % at ≥30×coverage) and broadly comparable with gene content recovery for hybrid assemblies (Fig. 6).

E. coli isolate sequencing

E. coli isolate sequencing: sequencing yield and read length distributions with and without BSA

The total sequencing yield for the run with BSA (BSA+) was 7.03 Gb, versus the run without BSA (BSA-) at 5.72 Gb. Following demultiplexing, ten isolates achieved enough bases for predicted ≥20×depth of coverage, however only nine empirically achieved this after mapping to the reference genomes and were used in further analysis (Fig. S8), although not all samples could be subsampled to 100×depth. Median (IQR) read lengths were shorter for the BSA +compared to BSA- groups: 2.61 Kb (IQR: 0.71–6.19 Kb) versus 3.42 Kb respectively (IQR: 1.28–7.12 Kb; P<0.001; two-sample Wilcoxon); (Figs S9 and S10). However, BSA treatment resulted in greater per-read accuracy across sequenced E. coli isolates (BSA +median %identity to the reference 99.32 % compared to BSA- median % identity 98.76 %; P<0.001, two sample Wilcoxon; Fig. S11.

E. coli isolate sequence assembly recovery and accuracy

R9.4.1+Illumina hybrid reference assemblies for the nine E. coli isolates included in the final analysis had chromosome sizes ranging from 4.7 to 5.26 Mb and contained between 2–8 plasmids, ranging in size from ~1.5 Kb to ~150 Kb (Table 2). Subsequently, using R10.4.1 long-read-only assembly, overall chromosome and plasmid recovery was roughly equal irrespective of the use of BSA, where incomplete assemblies were generated for some isolates and did not improve with increased depth (Fig. 7). All chromosomes and plasmids were at least partially recovered at subsampling depths≥20×. However, BSA+ outputs showed a small reduction of indel and SNV error rates in 7/9 assembled genomes, particularly for indel error rates (Fig. 8).

Fig. 7. Percentage of reference chromosome and plasmids recovered for each of nine sequenced clinical E. coli isolates passing QC with (yellow) and without (black) BSA use in library treatment. Sequencing was done using R10.4.1+Dorado v0.5.3 basecalling and assembly with Flye and a single round of Medaka polishing (see Methods). Size of dots represent the number of unique contigs. Panels without any dots represent exclusions due to lack of coverage to subsample at this depth. The number of plasmids varies by isolate and plasmid number reflects the size order of plasmids within an isolate and does not correspond to the same plasmid between isolates. The expected number of plasmids based on the hybrid assemblies and Table 2, is denoted in the facet row label. The letter number combination preceding the isolate numeric identifier indicates the E. coli phylogroup of the isolate.

Discussion

In this study we have shown that nanopore-only assemblies generated using R10.4.1 data to ~40× depth, basecalling with Dorado 0.5.3, and assembly with Flye and a single cycle of polishing with Medaka can be comparable to the high-throughput gold-standard approach of using Illumina-R9.4.1 or R10.4.1 nanopore hybrid assemblies (assembled using Unicycler). This reflects an iterative improvement over the R10.3 and R10.4 flowcells previously described (Fig. S12) [4], enabling accurate recovery of chromosomal and plasmid structures across the species evaluated.

We also observed that using BSA during the library preparation generally improved sequencing yields and read accuracy, representing potential savings for sequencing costs and laboratory time. In our hands the R10.4.1 flowcells (BSA+) generate ~6.4 Gb using the rapid library kit. The consumable cost of such a sequencing run is currently approximately £1200, resulting in a per isolate cost of £40–45 with 40×coverage Table 3.

In our experience, R10 sequencing runs, including R10.3, R10.4 and R10.4.1, have consistently produced shorter read lengths than sequencing the same extracts with R9.4.1 flowcells/chemistries. DNA extracts have been generated from new cultures for the R10.4.1 sequencing run, therefore not affected by freeze-thawing fragmenting the DNA. However, batch effects from independently extracting the DNA for each run may have influenced the fragment sizes. To better understand this, multiple replicates would be needed for both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 sequencing using the same DNA extracts.

Limitations

There are several limitations with this study. Our results are based on outputs from single runs only and there are no replicates for each sample and flowcell type; however, our findings of species-specific differences in sequencing outputs are similar to those observed by others [620 21]. Sequencing yield can be affected by numerous factors, including flowcell quality and baseline pore numbers, library preparation type, and operator skill. Replicating these findings by sequencing the same extracts using the same process across runs is important further work.

In this study we have compared annotated coding sequences between assembled genomes and the reference genome using a highly conservative requirement for a 100 % match; gene presence/absence studies may require less stringent thresholds. Similarly, different use cases may tolerate higher indel/SNV error rates – as a result we have presented these without applying arbitrary acceptability thresholds.

Although we observed species-specific differences in error rates and assembly quality, we have only investigated single isolates from three species and 13 E. coli isolates. Our findings may not be generalizable across other strains and species, and we would advise that users consider characterizing error rates and assembly quality for whichever species they are investigating by triangulating against a different method. Of note, there are regular updates to aspects of the ONT workflow such as basecallers and models, and we have not exhaustively investigated all possible combinations of sequencing, basecalling, assembly, and polishing strategy here, but have provided the raw data and reference assemblies to enable other users to evaluate their own workflows and updates.

In the context of these limitations however, we have found that R10.4.1/Kit 14 nanopore sequencing combined with updated, methylation-aware, basecalling models have improved bacterial genome reconstruction to enable reference quality genome assembly without the need for short-read sequencing and hybrid assembly. This could simplify pathogen genomics studies enabling cost-effective, higher-throughput and faster turnaround times.
