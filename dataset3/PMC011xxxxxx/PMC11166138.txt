Smartpaddle® is a novel wearable device based on inertial measurement units (IMU) for in-field arm-stroke kinetics and kinematics analysis in swimming. However, the lack of data regarding its agreement and reliability, coupled with restricted access to raw data, emphasizes the need to evaluate it against a well-established strain gauge (SG) reference method for assessing swimming forces. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the agreement and reliability between the Smartpaddle® and strain gauge in a 30-s all-out arms-only tethered swimming test. Twelve trained young adult swimmers performed a test-retest 30-s all-out arms-only tethered swimming trial. Peak and mean forces were obtained from IMU (PFIMU and MFIMU) and SG (PFSG and MFSG) simultaneously. Statistical differences and correlations were found in both peak (PFSG = 158.46 ± 48.85 N, PFIMU = 75.47 ± 12.05 N, p < 0.001, r = 0.88) and mean (MFSG = 69.62 ± 16.36 N, MFIMU = 30.06 ± 5.42 N, p < 0.001, r = 0.84) forces between devices, presenting elevated systematic errors for both variables. No differences were found in IMU data between test-retest conditions in both peak (PFIMU = 75.47 ± 12.05 N, PFIMU = 75.45 ± 11.54 N, p = 0.99, ICC = 0.96) and mean (MFIMU = 30.06 ± 5.42 N, MFIMU = 30.21 ± 5.83 N, p = 0.80, ICC = 0.95) forces, with negligible systematic errors. In conclusion, although the Smartpaddle® device is not directly comparable to the strain gauge reference method, it has demonstrated high reliability levels in test-retest trials.

The ability to apply force efficiently in water is a key factor for performance in competitive swimming events (19). Consequently, several methods and devices have been developed aiming to measure forces in swimming, and despite being a complex task due to the aquatic environment, it is considered essential by sports scientists, coaches, and practitioners to achieve peak sports performance (36).

Since the mid-20th century, there has been significant concern regarding investigations of the in-water forces applied by swimmers (1, 6, 16). Among the main methods developed for this, which involve force transducers (10, 28), pressure sensors (35, 38), 3-D motion analysis (13, 30), and computational fluid dynamics (32, 37), the complex setups, difficult data handling, and time-consuming feedback have been common drawbacks among these devices, limiting their use to those who are technically experts.

In an attempt to address these issues, commercial portable and wearable devices based on inertial measurement units (IMU), such as the Smartpaddle®, have been proposed as an alternative tool for in-field sports performance analysis, promising to provide coaches and swimmers with accurate outcomes, user-friendly data, and real-time feedback on arm-stroke kinetics and kinematics variables (17). Although there is no gold standard method for measuring in-water forces, the lack of data concerning the agreement and reliability of the Smartpaddle® data, coupled with the restriction of accessing raw data, emerges as the primary need to investigate its agreement and reliability against an extensively investigated reference-method in swimming.

The 30-s tethered swim test is a method based on strain gauges (SG) extensively used for direct force measurement in swimming. Due to its reliability (2, 3), it is highly employed in biomechanical and physiological research (9), including investigations on the training effects (29) and ergogenic aids (25), limb-asymmetry (20) and body-segment (21) assessments, and relationships with short-distance performances (22) and different swimming strokes (19). The comparison between the forces measured by the Smartpaddle® and strain gauges has not yet been investigated in swimming. The only study that compared these two devices conducted its research in kayaking (15), where the authors found no differences but statistical correlations in the force variables recorded by the Smartpaddle® and a strain gauge shift-paddle.

Despite suggesting that the devices can be compared to each other, the aforementioned results should not be extrapolated to swimming, and the lack of reliability analyses also increases the scientific gap regarding the use of Smartpaddle® in swimming. Therefore, to provide support to coaches and swimmers who currently use or intend to use the Smartpaddle® to assess their forces in daily training and time trial contexts, this study aimed to investigate the agreement and reliability between the Smartpaddle® and strain gauge device in a 30-s all-out arms-only tethered swimming test. We hypothesize that the Smartpaddle® is reliable but cannot be compared with the strain gauge device in a 30-s all-out arms-only tethered swimming test.

METHODS

Participants

Twelve trained young adult swimmers (18) voluntarily participated in this study. Participants’ characteristics are shown in Table 1. The inclusion criterion was swimmers with an active training program of at least three months with five or more training sessions per week. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Sao Paulo (protocol no: 55101221.1.0000.5659). All experimental procedures, performed only after obtaining the signed consent of the participants, were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (40) and the ethical standards of the International Journal of Exercise Science (24).

Protocol

Anthropometrical characteristics were determined using the densitometry method with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar iDXA, GE Healthcare) to assess the body mass, lean mass, and body fat percentual. Height and arm span were measured using a 1mm graded stadiometer (Micheletti, SP, BR) and a measuring tape, respectively. Additionally, individual World Aquatic Point Scores were calculated using the performance time of the last 50-m freestyle event in a 25-m short-course pool, as proposed (8).

To assess tethered swimming forces via IMU- and SG-based devices (i.e., Smartpaddle® and strain gauge, respectively), and to determine their agreement and reliability, a test and retest 30-s all-out arms-only tethered swimming trial was performed at a 24 hr interval. The test protocol was adapted from a previously proposed method (28), to isolate the upper limb segment. Unlike the strain gauge, the Smartpaddle® cannot determine the resultant forces from leg kicks. Therefore, to simultaneously measure the forces exerted by swimmers in a single effort, we focused solely on the forces of the upper limbs. Experimental procedures were conducted after a familiarization protocol, the assessments were performed in a short-course indoor pool (25-m long × 12-m wide) at a temperature of 27 ± 1 °C, and all participants were advised not to ingest caffeine, alcohol, and energy drinks for at least 12 hr before each assessment.

First, the swimmers performed a 1000-m warm-up (composed of 400-m low-paced freestyle, 4 × 50-m technique drills, 8 × 25-m [12.5 to 12.5 m] fast to low regressive-paced front crawl, and 200-m low-paced best-technique front crawl), and then proceeded to the lane in which the test would be performed. After securing the Smartpaddles® in their hands and fastening the ankle strap of the tethered swimming test apparatus around their ankles, the swimmers were instructed to swim at a low pace until the cable was fully extended. At this point, they were to wait for an audible signal to start the 30-s all-out effort in stationary mode (Figure 1). Additionally, to inhibit any force coming from the swimmer’s kick, an EVA pull buoy (24 × 15 × 7 cm) was placed between their ankles to improve buoyancy and prevent kicking throughout the efforts. In all assessments, the stroke frequency and breathing pattern were chosen arbitrarily by the participants, and all swimmers were instructed and verbally encouraged to give maximum effort during the efforts.

IMU peak (PFIMU, in N) and mean (MFIMU, in N) forces were recorded from each hand by the Smartpaddle® (Trainesense Oy, FI), and the outcomes were presented as the average of the two hands. The device is attached to the swimmer’s hand through silicon straps that allow for the measurement of force, velocity, and orientation of each arm stroke. The data is recorded at 100 Hz through pressure and inertial sensors with 9-axis IMU, downloaded via Bluetooth to Trainesense Session Manager between the device and a smartphone, and then uploaded to the web Analysis Center to provide instantaneous and real-time outcomes of kinematic and kinetic parameters. Furthermore, it is important to mention that the data processing algorithm (via closed MATLAB GUI [graphical user interface]) of the Smartpaddle® has not been published, making access to raw data impossible.

SG peak (PFSG, in N) and mean (MFSG, in N) forces were recorded by a strain gauge (CSA-100kg, MK Control and Instrumentations, SP, BR). The strain gauge was fixed to the starting block and attached to the swimmers’ ankle through a 7-m inextensible steel cable. The force data were acquired at 1000 Hz, amplified by an analog signal amplifier (MKTC05, MK Control and Instrumentations, SP, BR), recorded by a data acquisition board (USB-6009, National Instruments, Inc), and analyzed by an algorithm specifically developed in MATLAB software (R2018a, The MathWorks, Inc). To convert the signals collected in volts into newtons, a linear gain factor was calculated before each assessment using a calibration protocol with six progressively known weights (ranging from 0.1 to 10.2 kg).

Statistical Analysis

Using the Statistical Package for Social Science software (version 20.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) the normal data distribution was confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilk test and then the results were reported as mean ± 95% confidence intervals (CI).

The concurrent agreement between the SG and IMU data was determined as previously proposed (7). Firstly, differences between data were analyzed by the paired t-test. Effect sizes were reported as Cohen’s d (0 to 0.2 = small, 0.2 to 0.5 = medium, 0.5 to 0.8 = large) (5). Linear regression determinant (R2) and Pearson’s correlation (r) coefficients with their respective 95% CI were used to test the strength of the association between the peak and mean forces. The r cut-offs of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 were considered small, moderate, large, very large, and nearly perfect, respectively (11). In addition, the standard error of the estimate (SEE, in N) was calculated using the standard deviation of the residuals and interpreted as a measure of variation around the regression line. The agreement between both devices was additionally tested by the Bland-Altman graphical analysis, with the systematic bias accompanied by 95% limits of agreement (LoA = bias ± 1.96 SD) (4). In all cases, the significance level was set at p < 0.05

The reliability of IMU and SG data applied to the same individuals on repeated trials (i.e., test-retest) was verified as previously proposed (12). Therefore, the differences between trials were verified by the paired t-test, ES, and interpreted as in the concurrent agreement analysis above. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC, in %) and the 95% CI were calculated as a measure of relative reliability based on a two-way mixed-effects model, single measures, and absolute agreement (model 2,1) (12, 39). Also, the typical error (TE, in N) was calculated to access the within-subject variation (absolute reliability) by the standard deviation of the individual’s repeated measurements (12, 39). The TE was also expressed in relative terms as the coefficient of variation (CV, in %), as follows: CV = TE/mean · 100. Complementary, the smallest detectable difference (SDD, in N) was calculated as 1.96 · √2 · SEM (standard error of measurements), where SEM = SD · √(1–ICC) (39).

RESULTS

The agreement analysis between SG- and IMU-based devices is described in Table 2, and complementary Bland & Altman and linear regression graphical analysis are shown in Figure 2. Statistical differences and elevated systematic errors with individual residual values distributed within their LoAs were found between devices in both PFSG (mean difference = 82.99 [58.45 – 107.53] N, p < 0.001) and MFSG (mean difference = 39.56 [31.84 – 47.28] N, p < 0.001) in relation to PFIMU and MFIMU, respectively. However, very large significant correlations were found between PFSG and PFIMU (r = 0.88, p < 0.001), and MFSG and MFIMU (r = 0.84, p < 0.001).

The reliability analyses of IMU- and SG-based devices are described in Table 3. No statistical differences in peak and mean force variables were found between test and retest conditions in both IMU and SG data (p ≥ 0.15). Despite both devices exhibiting excellent reliability levels, higher ICC (PFIMU = 0.96 [0.86 – 0.99], MFIMU = 0.95 [0.83 – 0.98]) and lower TE (PFIMU = 2.52 N, MFIMU = 1.35 N), CV (PFIMU = 3.33 %, MFIMU = 4.48 %), and SDD (PFIMU = 6.51 N, MFIMU = 3.52 N) values were observed in IMU compared to SG data.

DISCUSSION

This study aimed to investigate the agreement and reliability of Smartpaddle® and strain gauge devices during a test-retest 30-s all-out arms-only tethered swimming trial. The agreement analyses indicated a significant correlation between SG and IMU data; however, statistical differences with elevated systematic errors were observed in PFIMU and MFIMU compared to PFSG and MFSG values. This evidence suggests that the IMU data cannot be considered comparable to the SG data. Conversely, the reliability analyses revealed no statistical differences in both IMU and SG data between test-retest conditions, negligible systematic errors, excellent ICC, and small CV values for all variables, indicating high reliability of the Smartpaddle® wearable device.

To the best of your knowledge, this is the first study that proposed to investigate the agreement between Smartpaddle® with the strain gauge force variables in swimming. Although commercial IMU wearable devices (such as the Smartpaddle®) allow the assessment of kinematics and kinetics in free-swimming conditions, conducting a 30-s all-out arms-only tethered swimming test in a stationary mode was necessary to simultaneously compare the same phenomenon using IMU and SG-based devices and obtain thrust forces as an average value of both hands from both devices in a single effort. Peak and mean forces showed significant correlations (r ≥ 0.84, p ≤ 0.001) between IMU and SG devices; nonetheless, the IMU data could not be compared to the SG data, as statistical differences (p ≤ 0.001) in PFSG and MFSG indicated 52.37% and 56.86% higher values compared to PFIMU and MFIMU, respectively.

Likewise, this study also represents the first investigation into the reliability of the Smartpaddle® in swimming. The data found suggest that force values obtained via IMU using the Smartpaddle® are highly reliable. There were no statistical differences observed in either PFIMU or MFIMU (p ≥ 0.80) between test and retest conditions. Concordance analyses revealed excellent ICC values (PFIMU = 0.96, MFIMU = 0.95), small CV (PFIMU = 3.33%, MFIMU = 4.48%), and individual residual values distributed within the LoA’s. Thus, the Smartpaddle® appears to be a highly suitable monitoring tool for obtaining and analyzing the swimming forces of swimmers in both daily training and time-trials contexts.

To date, only one study has investigated the agreement between Smartpaddle® against strain gauge (15); however, this investigation was not conducted in swimming, but rather in open-water kayaking. In this study, a strain-gauge paddle shaft served as the reference method for comparing the Smartpaddle®, and similar to our findings, strong significant correlations were found between SG and IMU data in both peak and mean forces (r ≥ 0.84) in kayaking. Nevertheless, no statistical differences (p = 0.083) were noted, with negligible systematic errors, and individual residual values distributed between LoAs, evidencing the agreement of the Smartpaddle® when compared to the strain-gauge paddle shaft in open-water kayaking (15).

In swimming, propulsive forces obtained by Smartpaddle® were compared with Aquanex® differential-pressure sensor in a 25-m all-out front crawl trial (17). The authors reported no statistical differences (p = 0.065), a significant relationship (R2 = 0.81), and negligible systematic error in mean force values obtained between the wearable devices. Using a methodological approach similar to our study, the agreement between differential pressure systems and strain gauge-based devices was also investigated (34). Although agreement between devices has not been performed simultaneously in a single effort, both peak and mean forces obtained by differential pressure system in two 25-m all-out efforts could not be compared with those recorded by the strain gauge in a 30-s tethered swimming test. As with our study, although statistical differences (p ≤ 0.001) and large biases (mean difference ≤ −43.79 N) were found, significant moderate to high relationships (R2 ≥ 0.25, p ≤ 0.05) between devices also were observed.

The tethered swimming protocol is not only widely used due to its high reliability (2, 23), but also because it correlates with performance in short- and middle-distance race-pace events (19, 22, 29, 31), and produces similar metabolic and physiological responses (23, 26, 27). Interestingly, our 30.06 N of MFIMU obtained from the average of both hands using the Smartpaddle® during the 30-s all-out arms-only tethered swimming test was similar to those of a 25-m all-out front crawl “free swimming” effort that measured the forces of both hands separately also by a Smartpaddle® (MFright = 34.50 ± 5.28 N, MFleft = 33.83 ± 4.65 N) (17). Additionally, similar mean force values were observed during the 10 to 15-m (MFright = 23.87 ± 4.87 N, MFleft = 27.03 ± 7.27 N) and 15 to 20-m (MFright = 24.17 ± 5.13 N, MFleft = 27.29 ± 8.15 N) sections of a 25-m all-out effort (14). Thus, based on the available data, the IMU data recorded by the Smartpaddle®, although not equivalent to the SG data, can be considered an excellent IMU-based tool for measuring arm stroke propulsive forces, along with others kinetics and kinematics variables in swimming training sessions and time trials. Finally, since the absolute tethered swimming force values between methods cannot be directly compared, the correction equation provided in Figure 2 can be employed if necessary.

The discrepancy between monitoring features and experimental protocols, coupled with the absence of a gold-standard method to assess in-water forces, renders this topic a subject of heated debate within the sports science community. The central query surrounding swimming forces revolves around the comparison of “free vs. stationary swimming” evaluation methods, and the inconclusive findings thus far stem from the inherent complexity of this question. Our results, particularly elucidated through Bland & Altman’s graphical analysis, indicate that the IMU data cannot be compared with the SG data due to the distinct nature of the force phenomenon each measure. While the SG device records the aggregated of all force-time curves during the tethered swimming effort, the IMU device measures the force exerted by individual body limbs separately. Given this perspective, isolating the arm strokes during the 30-s all-out effort was an attempt to mitigate this issue by preventing any type of force not originating from the hands to be exerted. In addition, the absence of drag forces and the water flow at zero velocity during stationary swimming may disrupt the ability to apply force in water, potentially resulting in an overestimation of these values compared to free swimming (33), thereby exacerbating the disparity in force data obtained between SG and IMU data.

Some limitations of the present study must be highlighted. Firstly, access to the raw data is unavailable to users in both smartphone Trainesense Session Manager and web Analysis Center. Furthermore, the MATLAB GUI data processing algorithm has not been published by the developers, rendering it impossible to process any type of raw data acquired via IMU by the Smartpaddle®. It is important to emphasize that our results were derived from the average between both hands; we did not include an analysis between dominant and non-dominant limbs, and we consider this to be a significant limitation for future studies. In addition, our results were obtained from trained swimmers (18), and thus cannot be extrapolated to elite and world-class competitive-level swimmers. Finally, we suggest that the high reliability of the Smartpaddle® be thoroughly tested against other devices (including other pressure sensors), in a free-swimming context, particularly regarding the device’s reliability and sensibility in cross-sectional and longitudinal experimental designs (e.g., between different age-group and competitive-level swimmers, and effects of in-water or dry-land training periods).

In conclusion, although we have demonstrated that the Smartpaddle® cannot be interchangeably used with the strain gauge reference method in a 30-s all-out arms-only tethered swimming test, this device has demonstrated high reliability in the test-retest trial and provides a practical tool for daily use by coaches and swimmers
