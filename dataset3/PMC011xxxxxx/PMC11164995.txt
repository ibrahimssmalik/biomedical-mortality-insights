pmcCorrection to: Nature Communications 10.1038/s41467-024-46602-3, published online 16 March 2024

The original version of this Article contained an error in Fig. 2b, in which the micro-CT image used as the representative image for male Malat1-/- in Fig. 2a was duplicated and presented as the representative image for the female Malat1+/+ mice.

This error has been now corrected in both the PDF and HTML versions of the Article.

All micro-CT images used to generate the plots in Fig. 2c, d are now provided through the following link:

https://figshare.com/articles/figure/micro-CT_images_for_Figs_2c_and_2d_tif/25683639

Representative images used in Fig. 2a (males): 6297L, 5958L, and 6862R.

Representative images used in Fig. 2b (females): 97R, 79R, and 70R.
