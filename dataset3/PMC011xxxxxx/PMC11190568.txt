﻿Abstract

Morphological and phylogenetic analyses on samples of Xylaria species associated with fallen fruits from China were carried out, and two new species were described, namely X.aleuriticola and X.microcarpa. Xylariaaleuriticola is found on fallen fruits of Aleuritesmoluccana, and characterized by stromata dichotomously branched several times with long acute sterile apices, fertile parts roughened with perithecia and tomentose, and ellipsoid to fusiform ascospores. Xylariamicrocarpa differs in its very small stromata with dark brown tomentum, light brown ascospores with an inconspicuous straight germ slit, and grows on leguminous pods. The differences between the new species and morphologically similar species are discussed. Phylogenetic analyses on ITS-RPB2-TUB sequences confirmed that the two species are clearly separated from other species of the genus Xylaria. Xylarialiquidambaris is reported as a new record from China. A key to the Xylaria species associated with fallen fruits and seeds reported from China is provided to facilitate future studies of the genus.

pmc﻿Introduction

Xylaria Hill ex Schrank, with more than 878 epithets listed in Index Fungorum (http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp, accessed on 22 November 2023), was currently the largest genus in the family Xylariaceae (Hsieh et al. 2010; Fournier et al. 2018a). The members of Xylaria have a worldwide distribution, but they are highly diverse in the tropics and subtropics (Dennis 1956; Ju and Rogers 1999; Ju and Hsieh 2007; Lodge et al. 2008; Fournier et al. 2011; Wangsawat et al. 2021). Species of Xylaria are saprobic, pathogenic, or endophytic and associated with a wide range of host (Rogers 1979a; Vannini et al. 1996; Whalley 1996; Crozier et al. 2006; Thomas et al. 2008; U’Ren et al. 2009; de Vega et al. 2010). According to the substrate in which these fungi grow, the taxa of the genus can be divided into four different ecological types, viz., wood-inhabiting type, termite nests inhabiting type, foliicolous type, and fructicolous/seminicolous type. The Xylaria species associated with fallen fruits and seeds preferred to somewhat substrate-specific (Rogers 1979b; Læssøe and Lodge 1994; Ju et al. 2018; Perera et al. 2020).

The generic concept of Xylaria was traditionally based on morphological studies (Dennis 1957, 1958; Rogers et al. 1987, 1988; San Martín and Rogers 1989; Fournier 2014; Fournier et al. 2020). In the past two to three decades, molecular phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the family Xylariaceae by using a single-gene to multi-gene (Lee et al. 2000; Bahl et al. 2005; Ju et al. 2004, 2007; Peláez et al. 2008; Hsieh et al. 2010; Læssøe et al. 2013; Wangsawat et al. 2021). Nuclear ribosomal DNA, ITS-5.8S, and protein-coding gene are commonly used for inferring phylogenetic relationships (Tang et al. 2009; Visser et al. 2009). The new genus Neoxylaria was segregated from Xylaria based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence (Konta et al. 2020). The genus Xylaria is quite common in China, however, molecular studies on the Xylaria are still poorly used (Teng 1963; Tai 1979; Li and Li 1994; Xu 1999; Zhu and Guo 2011; Ma et al. 2011, 2013). Especially, the phylogenetic relationships inferring from multi-gene between Xylaria species associated with fruits and other Xylaria species as well as other genera in the Xylariaceae remain unsolved, and the species diversity and geographical distribution in China are unclear.

During the investigation of xylariaceous taxa from China, 18 samples belonging to 3 species of Xylaria associated with fruits were collected. Based on morphological and multi-gene phylogenetic evidences, two new species and one new Chinese record are introduced in this study.

﻿Materials and methods

﻿Sample collection and morphological studies

The studied samples were collected from south China during 2013–2020. The fallen fruits bearing xylariaceous stromata were dried with a SX-770 portable drier of Foshan Taomeihui Electric Appliance Co., Ltd (Guangdong, China), and deposited in the Fungarium of Institute of Tropical Bioscience and Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (FCATAS). Macro- and micro-morphological studies were carried out in this study and followed Ma et al. (2022). Stromatal surface and perithecia were observed and measured by using a VHX-600E 3D microscope of the Keyence Corporation (Osaka, Japan). Microscopic observations and examinations were performed by using an Olympus IX73 inverted fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and the CellSens Dimensions Software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). In presenting ascospore size variation, 5% of measurements were excluded from each end of the range and given in parentheses. The following abbreviations were used: KOH = 5% potassium hydroxide, SDS = 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, M = mean ascospore length × mean ascospore width, Q = the ration of mean ascospore length / mean ascospore width, n (a/b) = number of ascospores (a) measured from number of specimens (b). Colour terms followed Rayner (1970).

﻿DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing

Total genomic DNA was extracted from dried specimens using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) rapid extraction kit (Aidlab Biotechnologies, Beijing) following its instruction with some modifications as in Song et al. (2022). Three DNA gene fragments, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2) gene, and β-tubulin (TUB) were amplified using the primer pairs ITS5/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), fRPB2-5F/fRPB2-7cR (Liu et al. 1999), and T1/T22 (O’ Donnell et al. 1997), respectively. The PCR procedures for the three sequences followed Pan et al. (2022). Newly generated sequences were uploaded on GenBank and listed in Table 1.

﻿Phylogenetic analyses

Xylaria species associated with fallen fruits and seeds were subjected to phylogenetic analyses in other various species of Xylaria and closely related genera including Amphirosellinia, Astrocystis, Kretzschmaria, Nemania, Podosordaria, and Rosellinia (Table 1). Poroniapileiformis (Berk.) Fr. was selected as an outgroup (Wangsawat et al. 2021; Ma et al. 2022).

The sequences of ITS, RPB2 and TUB2 were aligned individually using the online MAFFT tool (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html), and improved manually using BioEdit 7.0.5.3 (Hall 1999) and ClustalX 1.83 (Thompson et al. 1997). The individual gene data sets were concatenated using the MEGA 6.0 (Tamura et al. 2011). The concatenated data set of ITS, RPB2 and TUB (ITS-RPB2-TUB) data set of studied species were carried out using Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was conducted by raxmlGUI 2.0 using rapid bootstrapping with 1000 replicates, and GTRGAMMA+G as a substitution model (Felsenstein 1981). Bayesian inference (BI) analysis was performed in MrBayes 3.2.6 with jModelTest 2 conducting model discrimination (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001). Six simultaneous Markov chains were run from random starting trees for 1 million generations, and trees were sampled every 1000th generations. The first 25% of sampled trees were discarded as burn-in, and the remaining were used to calculate the posterior probability (PP) of each branch (Larget and Simon 1999). The combined alignment and phylogenetic tree were deposited in Figshare (https://figshare.com/s/e1c181f1e3a56164ecc3).

﻿Results

﻿Molecular phylogeny

Eighteen Xylaria species associated with fallen fruits and seeds were subjected to phylogenetic analyses based on ITS-RPB2-TUB dataset in Xylariaceae. The BI and ML analyses generated highly similar topologies, the ML tree is presented with bootstrap values ≥ 75% and Bayesian posterior probabilities ≥ 0.90 respectively (Fig. 1).

Notes.

Xylariaaleuriticola, associated with the pericarps of A.moluccana (Euphorbiaceae), is characterized by stromata dichotomously branched several times with long acute sterile apices, fertile parts roughened with perithecia and tomentose, and tomentose stipes. It is similar to X.culleniae Berk. & Broome by having dichotomously branched stromata and ascospores dimensions, but the latter species branches dichotomously only once in fertile parts, ascospores surrounded with a hyaline sheath and non-cellular appendages, and grows on capsules of Culleniaexcelsa (Malvaceae) (Rogers et al. 1988; Ju et al. 2018). Xylariaeuphorbiicola Rehm was described on fruits of Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae) from Brazil, but it has unbranched stromata, lacking perithecial mounds, overlain with a brown striped outermost layer, and smaller discoid apical ring 1µm high × 1.5–2 µm broad (Ju et al. 2018). Xylariaianthinovelutina somewhat resembles X.aleuriticola in stromatal morphology, but it has stronger stromata, larger ascospores (9–)9.5–11(–12) × (3.5–)4–4.5(–5) µm (M = 10.3 × 4.0 µm), and often associated with leguminous pods (Dennis 1956, 1957; Ju et al. 2018), while stromata of the new speices has sharper and longer sterile apices, more forked. Xylarialuzonensis Henn. differs from X.aleuriticola by its smaller stromata (1.5–3 cm long × 0.5–1 mm diam), smaller perithecia (200–300 µm diam), slightly smaller apical ring (1–1.5 µm high × 1.5 µm broad), light brown ascospores, and grows on pod of Bauhiniacumingiana (Fabaceae) (Ju et al. 2018). Xylariaapeibae Mont. is close to X.aleuriticola in stromatal morphology, from which it differs mainly by having smaller stromata 4 cm long × 0.8–1.5 mm diam, light brown and larger ascospores (9.5–)10–12(–13) × (3–)3.5–4(–4.5) µm (M = 11.0 × 3.7 µm), and grows on fruits of Apeiba species (Tiliaceae) (Ju et al. 2018). In the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1), X.aleuriticola clustered together with high support values (BS = 98, PP = 1.00) with X.fabaceicola, but the latter species is distinguished by its smaller stromata 13–25 mm long, pale brown to brown ascospores with a hyaline sheath and appendages, and the fact that it grows on decaying pods of Fabaceae (Perera et al. 2020).

Stromata upright or prostrate, often densely gregarious in large groups, unbranched, cylindrical to filiform, with acute sterile apices, on tomentose stipes, 3.5–9 mm total height; fertile parts 2–6 mm high × 0.6–1.5 mm broad, filiform to cylindrical, brown tomentose dense or sparse, nodulose with perithecial contours exposed; stipes 1.5–4 mm high × 0.3–0.5 mm broad, terete, with conspicuously dark brown tomentose, arising from slighly enlarged base; surface black, interior light yellow, solid, woody. Perithecia subglobose, 300–500 µm. Ostioles conic-papillate.

Notes.

Xylariamicrocarpa is characterized by very small stromata growing in groups, overlain with a dark brown tomentum, ascospores light brown with an inconspicuous straight germ slit, lacking a sheath or appendages, and grows on leguminous pods. The new species resembles X.fabacearum R.H. Perera, E.B.G. Jones & K.D. Hyde by sharing small stromata and ascospores length dimensions, but differs from the latter species in having stromata branched sometimes, stromatal surface without tomentose, brown to dark brown ascospores with conspicuous straight germ slit (Perera et al. 2020). Xylarialuzonensis on Bauhiniacumingiana (Fabaceae) differs from X.microcarpa by having branched and larger stromata, smaller perithecia, and smaller ascospores (8–)8.5–9.5(–10) × 3–3.5(–4) µm (M = 8.9 × 3.4 µm) (Ju et al. 2018). Xylariamicrocarpa is somewhat similar to X.ianthinovelutina and X.culleniae in stromatal surface with tomentum and grow on leguminous pods, but the later two taxa differ in larger stromata, ascospores with a straight germ slit slightly less than spore-length, surrounded with a hyaline sheath and non-cellular appendages (Ju et al. 2018). The phylogenetic tree showed that Xylariamicrocarpa and X.aethiopica J. Fourn., Y.M. Ju, H.M. Hsieh & U. Lindem are sister taxa with a strong supported branch in BI tree (BS=0.98), but X.aethiopica is distinct morphologically with larger stromata 15–30 mm total height, brown to dark brown and slightly larger ascospores (9.7–)11–13(–13.5) × (3.5–)3.8–4.5(–4.9) µm (M = 11.9 × 4.1 µm) with a conspicuous straight germ and appendages, and grows on fallen woody pods of Millettiaferruginea (Fabaceae) (Fournier et al. 2018b).

Notes.

Xylarialiquidambaris was originally described by Rogers et al. (2002) from USA, and has high specificity to fruits of Liquidambar (Altingiaceae). It is characterized by unbranched stromata with acute sterile apex, embedded to slightly prominent perithecia with longitudinal striations, brown ascospores with long spiraling germ slit (Rogers et al. 2002). These Chinese materials well fit the descriptions and illustrations of X.liquidambaris by Rogers et al. (2002).

﻿Discussion

In the present study, two new Xylaria species associated with fallen fruits were described and compared with closely related species based on morphological and molecular data. In addition, X.liquidambaris has been reported from China for the first time. We included eighteen Xylaria species on fallen fruits and seeds in the phylogenetic trees based on a combined ITS-RPB2-TUB2 dataset. The phylogenetic analyses showed that seventeen species are mainly distributed in three different subclades, while Xylariacf.gleculosa clustered with Xylaria species on wood, which is consistent with the previous studies (Hsieh et al. 2010; Perera et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2022).

By inclusion of the two new species we described here, thirty-seven species on fallen fruits and seeds are now recognized in the genus Xylaria (Rogers 1979b; Stowell and Rogers 1983; Rogers et al. 2002; Pande and Waingankar 2004; Rönsch et al. 2010; Hsieh et al. 2010; Dillon et al. 2018; Ju et al. 2018; Fournier et al. 2018b; Perera et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2022). Compared to the number of Xylaria species on fruits and seeds, the available sequences of these species in NCBI are relatively fewer. Most species in this group are lacking DNA sequences, and some species only have one or two sequences, for X.carpophila just has ITS sequences, and X.karyophthora from Guyana with ITS and RPB2 sequences available (Dillon et al. 2018; Vu et al. 2019). Moreover, almost half the taxa, e.g., X.apeibae Mont., X.clusiae K.F. Rodrigues, X.duranii San Martín & Vanoye, X.euphorbiicola Rehm, X.guazumae San Martín & J.D. Rogers, X.heloidea Penz. & Sacc., X.himalayensis Narula & Rawla, X.jaliscoensis San Martín, J.D. Rogers & Y.M. Ju, X.luzonensis Henn., X.magnolia J.D. Rogers, X.magnoliavar.microspora J.D. Rogers, Y.M. Ju & Whalley, X.patrisiae Henn., X.psidii J.D. Rogers & Hemmes, X.rhizocola (Mont.) Fr., X.rossmanae Y.M. Ju, J.D. Rogers, X.terminaliae-bellericae Pande & Waingankar, X.terminaliae-crenulatae Pande & Waingankar, and X.warburgii Henn., still have no available sequences. The current molecular study of Xylaria usually uses ITS, RPB2, TUB, and α-ACT (Hsieh et al. 2010; Fournier et al. 2018b; Perera et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2022), which is not so sufficient. In recent years, genome sequencing, sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing have been used in some macrofungi groups for inferring phylogenetic relationships (Wibberg et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2023). To further understand the taxonomy and phylogeny of Xylaria associated with fruits and seeds, newly collected specimens from their original regions, more taxa and more DNA sequences need to be included in future study.
