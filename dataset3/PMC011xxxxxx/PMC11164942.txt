Eigenvalues have great importance in the field of mathematics, and their relevance extends beyond this area to include several other disciplines such as economics, chemistry, and numerous fields. According to our study, eigenvalues are utilized in chemistry to express a chemical compound’s numerous physical properties as well as its energy form. It is important to get a comprehensive understanding of the interrelationship underlying mathematics and chemistry. The anti-bonding phase is correlated with positive eigenvalues, whereas the bonding level is connected with negative eigenvalues. Additionally, the non-bonded level corresponds to eigenvalues of zero. This study focuses on the analysis of various structures of anticancer drugs, specifically examining their characteristic polynomials, eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, matching number and nullity. Consequently, the selected structures of the aforementioned anticancer drugs exhibit stability since they are composed of closed-shell molecules, characterized by a nullity value of zero.

Cancer is defined as the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the human system over an extended period of time. Carcinogens are any substances that have the potential to cause cancer. One of the main elements of smoke from cigarettes is an organic compound known as a carcinogen. Carcinogens are known to cause cancer. It is able to travel to different parts of the body.

This problem manifests itself in a variety of ways, some of which include an abnormal bleeding, or lump, a persistent cough, and a loss of weight. Chewing tobacco, being overweight, having a bad diet, not exercising enough, and drinking too much alcohol are the primary factors that lead to this malignant illness. This life-threatening condition may be managed with a variety of therapeutic approaches, such as targeted therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and many more. Medications classified as anticancer drugs, such as metabolites and alkylates are often administered in order to treat cancer, the illness1–4.

The field of science and mathematics is known as chemical graph theory which deals with chemical-based graphs, which are representations of molecular processes. The molecular graph theory makes it possible to define a wide variety of anticancer drug features5,6. In this work, many different medicational configurations are used, and they are measured using characteristics polynomials, adjacency matrix, eigenvalues, matching number and nullity. The nullity of a molecule is a significant contributor to its level of stability; hence, if the nullity of the molecule is zero, it is anticipated that the molecule will have a stable, closed-shell electron configuration. If nullity is greater than zero, the molecule is not just unstable but also very reactive, nonexistent, and has an open shell7. As a consequence of this, all of the structures of the anticancer drugs mentioned above are examples of closed-shell molecules that are stable due to the fact that their nullity is equal to zero.

Literature review

There exists a substantial body of scholarly literature pertaining to the topics of characteristic polynomials, eigenvalues of adjacency matrices, matching numbers and nullity. This document presents a selection of current and significant papers, highlighting their respective value. The concept of nullity is quantified by the greatest degree of a vertex8,9. The literature contains scholarly works that go into the realm of pure mathematics and abstract theory on nullity, which may be found in the references10–12. The study conducted by13 explores unicyclic graphs in relation to their nullity and matching number. On the other hand,14 provides an analysis of bicyclic graphs. Additionally,15 investigates the line operation of unicyclic graphs and its impact on their nullity. These references provide valuable insights into the respective topics. The characterization of rank four graphs may be found in the work of16, while the characterization of rank five graphs is provided in the study of17 included in the references. To find upper limits on the nullity n-2 and n-3, please refer to the work of18 and19 respectively. This study examines the nullity of a graph that has cut-points, as discussed in research paper20. The concept of trees is examined in relation to the nullity of a graph as presented in the work of21. The paper by22 presents a study on the correlation between the matching number and rank of a graph. The hypothesis about nullity is supported by a proof presented in the work of23.

In recent years, graph theory provide some efficient tools to study in different fields like in fuzzy24,25, in decision making26–28, in chemistry29,30, in molecular physics31–33.

Preliminaries of the study

A molecular compound is often represented in a graphical format, where the individual constituents are displayed as vertices (which is also referred as nodes) and the connections between them are represented as edges (which is also referred as lines). In a similar vein, the chemical compounds being examined for their anticancer properties are subject to analysis, whereby several factors are evaluated. Graph theory offers many techniques, including Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR), Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR), and Quantitative Structure-Toxicity Relationship (QSTR), which may be used by chemists and pharmacists to augment their research endeavors. In the field of mathematical chemical science, medicines are shown as molecular networks, whereby individual atoms are symbolized by vertices, and the connections between two atoms are denoted by edges51,52. Let us consider a molecular graph denoted as G(V,E), where V represents the set of vertices and E represents the set of edges. We examine simple graphs with no production of cycles and many edges. Let |VG|=N and |EG|=M denote the order and size of a graph G,  respectively. The adjacency matrix, represented as BinG, is a mathematical representation of a graph. Its members indicate whether pairs of vertices in the graph are adjacent or not.The characteristic polynomial of a graph may be defined as the determinant of the matrix BinG minus λ times the identity matrix I,  which is equal to zero. Here, I represents an identity matrix of the same order as the matrix Bin. The expression detBinG-λI=0 of the structure λ gave some values in output which is symbolized as eigenvalues and we denoted those values as ECPBinG;λ. The mulitplicity of ECPBinG;λ=0 is called as nullity of a network G,  and we symbolized this with the symbol NulG53. The nullity of a bipartite network is described in54.1 NulG=N-2MNG.

The parameter MNG in Eq. (1) is often referred to as the matching number. It is defined as the cardinality of the biggest maximum independent edge set, as stated in previous works55,56. In Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, the presence of wavy edges indicates that these edges are associated with the calculation of the matching number for all structures of anticancer drugs. Some graph theoretical study is conducted in57–60.Figure 1 Anticancer drug structure Daunorubicin.

Figure 6 Anticancer drug structure Raloxifene.

In the field of mathematics, the expression E=∑i=1k=|VG||λi| is presented as stated by7. The energy of a graph, denoted as G,  is defined as the absolute sum of all its eigenvalues. Whereas the negative inertia index is denoted by the quantity of negative eigenvalues q(G),  and the positive inertia index is denoted by the quantity of positive eigenvalues p(G).

ECPBinG6;λ={-2.3937,-2.2547,-2.2108,-2.1371,-1.9500,-1.6996,-1.5451,-1.3987,-1.2363,-1.0492,-1,-1,-1,-0.8551,-0.6549,-0.1316,-1.844e-15,-1.2044e-15,0.3119,0.6402,0.7840,1,1,1,1.0572,1.2185,1.3773,1.4711,1.7028,1.8948,2.1387,2.1539,2.2385,2.527}.

It is observed that there is an absence of a precise zero value from the given data ECPBinG6;λ=0 and which is concluding that NulG6=0.

Moreover, Fig. 6 illustrates the presence of sixteen instances of undulating boundaries, which corresponds to the value of MG6.

Furthermore, the total energy may be determined as 45.0338 by adding all the individual energies, denoted as ECPBinG6;λ.

The determination has been made that the selected structure of the anticancer medicine is stable, consisting of closed-shell molecules, as shown by its nullity value of zero. □

Discussion and conclusion

Several structures of anticancer drugs have been investigated, including Daunorubicin, Deguelin, Minocycline, Podophylotoxin, Pterocellin-B, and Raloxifene. The aforementioned structures are analyzed with respect to their characteristic, eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix polynomials, matching number and nullity. Consequently, the selected structures of the aforementioned anticancer drugs exhibit stability since they are composed of closed-shell molecules, characterized by a nullity value of zero. Furthermore, the findings are succinctly presented in Table 1.Table 1 This study investigates the energy, positive-negative-inertia, and nullity properties of different structures of anticancer drugs.

G	Nul(G)	p(G)	q(G)	E	
G1	0	19	18	48.1216	
G2	0	14	17	39.8922	
G3	0	18	18	41.4910	
G4	0	15	15	39.9131	
G5	0	12	12	31.9854	
G6	0	16	18	45.0338	

The formula for the first Betti number, denoted as b1(G), is given by the expression M+|C|-N, where M represents the number of edges in the graph, |C| denotes the count of graph components, and N represents a certain quantity. In the case when there is a single linked component, denoted as |C|=1. The equation is modified to b1(G)=M+1-N, where all selected drug structures are considered as linked components. The phrase “cyclomatic number,” which was developed by61. The cyclomatic number refers to the quantity of edge deletions required for a graph to transition into an acyclic state. In Elshoff’s study (1978), the concept of nullity is sometimes referred to as the cyclomatic number (cn(G)) or the first Betti number62. A comparison is made between the cyclomatic number of structures pertaining to anticancer drugs, first Betti number and the nullity, in the Table 2.Table 2 There are many criteria that govern the characteristics of different architectures of anticancer drugs.

G	Nul(G)	b1(G)	cn(G)	
G1	0	5	5	
G2	0	5	5	
G3	0	4	4	
G4	0	5	5	
G5	0	4	4	
G6	0	5	5	

Based on the comparison shown in Table 2, it can be seen that the initial Betti number and nullity of the various structures of anticancer drugs exhibit dissimilarities. Remarkably, it has been shown that the cyclomatic number and the first Betti number exhibit identical values across all configurations.
