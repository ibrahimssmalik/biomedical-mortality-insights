pmc1 Introduction

An essential part of contemporary technology, a photodetector is a device that transforms light into electrical signals. This indispensable instrument finds extensive usage throughout diverse sectors from sensing technology to communications [1]. Photodetectors are essential for allowing information to be transmitted across optical fibers and enabling effective communication networks because they use the power of photons. Photodetectors, as the portal to the world of light, are still driving innovation and reshaping the electronics and communications scene of today [2].

Because of the hefty propagation and lower abatement properties of near-infrared (NIR) light, NIR photodetectors that can convert light energy into electrical signals are currently attracting a lot of interests for use in security, biomedical imaging, night vision and optical fibers communications [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. Traditionally, NIR PDs are made employing InGaAs and Ge-based devices with a cut-off wavelength greater than 1.5 μm. Because of having low cut-off wavelength of 1.1 μm, silicon (Si)-based photodetectors exhibit low external quantum efficiency and are difficult to employ for NIR wavelength detection [7,8]. In addition, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 perovskite PD has been showcased with a responsivity of 0.54 A/W and detectivity of 3.3 × 1013 Jones [9]. On the other hand, PDs made of Ge semiconductor experience an elevated reverse or dark current (∼10 mA/cm2) which is very higher in magnitude than that of the InGaAs PDs (∼0.5 μA/cm2). Therefore, low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and responsiveness results are achieved from this Ge-based PD structure [[10], [11], [12]]. However, the problems arise due to the expensive production methods associated with InGaAs-based photodetectors [13,14].

Recently, near-infrared photodetectors (NIR-PDs) have been produced by a technique that involves spin coated colloidal quantum dots (QDs) [15]. But the gadget had drawbacks, such as a narrow 3-dB bandwidth of only 18 Hz and a high working voltage of 40 V. Their wider practical utility in these sectors is hindered by these limitations, which significantly limit their viability in imaging and communication applications that require high-speed and low-power photodetectors [16]. Present generation of widely used infrared photodetectors mostly make use of narrow-band-gap compounds like InSb, HgCdTe and PbS QDs [[17], [18], [19]]. However, there are a number of disadvantages that these devices frequently face, such as toxicity to the environment, complex production procedures, high costs and significant response times [20]. Moreover, in the present conversations, there is still disagreement and doubt surrounding the assessment of Quantum dot infrared photodetectors (QDIP's) and Quantum wire infrared photodetectors (QRIP's) capabilities [21]. These drawbacks prevent them from being widely used, which calls for improvements in photo-detection technologies to solve these issues and make infrared sensing more effective and widely available for a range of applications.

Herein, the more straightforward ternary compound Ag3CuS2 (jalpaite) has been used as an absorber material for high performance NIR photoactive layer. Ag3CuS2 belongs to I41/amd space group and tetragonal shape with unit cell parameters of a = 8.6705 Å and c = 11.7573 Å [22]. Ag3CuS2 has previously been demonstrated to exhibit photocatalytic behavior when combined with Ag2S and Ag [23]. But the recent works on solar cells that use it as an absorber layer has made it immediately interesting [24,25]. The key role of an absorber is to generate electron-hole pairs which is perfectly done by this jalpaite material [26]. Since Breithaupt initially identified Ag3CuS2 as the mineral jalpaite in 1858, mineralogists have been interested in this compound due to its intriguing characteristics as well as its significance as a noble metal resource [[27], [28], [29]]. Ag3CuS2's prospective uses as copper-selective electrodes have been documented in earlier research [28,29]. This Ag3CuS2 compound has been suggested as a potential photon absorbing material for photovoltaic cells and other optoelectronic devices because of its (i) higher light absorption capability in the visible regions, (ii) lower toxicity, and (iii) readily available and affordable raw materials [24]. Although, some experimental works have been conducted on Ag3CuS2 finding the crystal structure, Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, effective masses, direct bandgaps, carrier mobilities indicating its application in different fields such as thermoelectric and photovoltaic [[30], [31], [32]]. However, no experimental work has been done as a photodetector. In this work, Ag3CuS2 compound has been chosen as the absorber material in the photodetector (PD) application because of its aforementioned benefits.

Native n-type semiconducting tungsten disulfide (WS2) belongs to the space group of C2/m and displays a hexagonal shape. The lattice parameters of this compound are a = 12.8417 Å, b = 3.2177 Å and c = 5.6912 Å, separately and it shows a greater stability at thin condition which enhances thermal conductivity [33]. WS2 includes strong mobility of carriers and superior electrical conductivity in the range of 10−3 Ω−1 cm−1 [34,35]. Comparing WS2 to other transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials, it is less hazardous, less expensive and more prevalent in the Earth's crust [36]. Its adjustable bandgap is a crucial feature that is rarely discussed. Depending on how it is made, WS2 can have a low indirect bandgap (<1.5 eV) or a large direct bandgap (>2 eV) [37]. Its significantly larger W atom size allows it to modify its structural characteristics according to the use for which it is intended [37,38]. WS2 has been selected as the window layer for Ag3CuS2 based PD due to its distinct optoelectronic and electrochemical characteristics.

Barium silicide (BaSi2) which is made from barium (Ba) and silicon (Si) has some interesting properties that bring out its attention to be used as a back surface layer in Ag3CuS2 based PD. Barium is a soft silvery-gray colored element with an atomic number of 56 [39]. BaSi2 belongs to the Pnma space group and orthorhombic structure with lattice constants of a = 8.942 Å, b = 6.733 Å and c = 11.555 Å, separately [40]. BaSi2 has found applications in thin film solar cell (TFSC) due to its good chemical stability and wide bandgap ranging from 1.1 to 1.35 eV [41]. Since Ba and Si are readily available on Earth, adding a thin layer of BaSi2 might significantly lower the cost of producing Ag3CuS2 PD. Approximately 30–40 times more absorption occurs in BaSi2 than in single-crystalline silicon (c-Si) [42,43]. BaSi2 is thought to be the ideal absorber material for solar cells based on both experimental and theoretical investigations [39,[41], [42], [43]].

This article reports Ag3CuS2 based PD with WS2 and BaSi2 window and BSF layer, respectively. The photo-sensing performance of the device has been numerically probed in details by considering different parameters of the constituent layers showcasing it's capability as a PD device.

2 Designing of device and computational approach

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the structure of the modeled n-WS2/p-Ag3CuS2/p + -BaSi2 photodetector with its energy band diagram, in sequence. Ag3CuS2 possesses a bandgap of 1.05 eV with electron affinity 3.55 eV that make it a suitable candidate for use as a photodetector. WS2 is the window layer, and BaSi2 is the BSF layer used in the Ag3CuS2 based PD. Both compound materials present bandgaps of 2.2 and 1.3 eV and electron affinities of 3.95 and 3.3 eV, in turn. Therefore, WS2 and BaSi2 forms effective n-p-p+ heterojunction with Ag3CuS2 semiconductor.Fig. 1 (a) Illustrative block and (b) band diagram of proposed n-WS2/p-Ag3CuS2/p + -BaSi2 PD.

Fig. 1

However, the interface defects may be introduced as there exists lattice-mismatch between WS2/Ag3CuS2 and Ag3CuS2/BaSi2 junctions. Consequently, reasonable amount of defects have been considered in the interfaces as in Table 1. The Ti and Cu front and back contacts with respective work functions of 3.84 and 4.7 eV are used to collect carriers efficiently. Appropriate alignment and effective carrier transportation to the electrodes are the outcomes of selecting the window and BSF layers.Table 1 Input parameters used for simulating Ag3CuS2 based photodetector.

SCAPS-1D software is used to compute the Ag3CuS2 based PD. It is frequently used to examine different solar cells and photodetectors. The simulator may include various characteristics like bandgap, work function, doping, thickness, and defects. To find voltage, photocurrent, quantum efficiency, capacitor voltage, and C-f, SCAPS solves a set of equations. Poisson's equation, the hole and the electron continuity equations are among the equations that are involved [[44], [45], [46], [47], [48]].(1) (Poisson′sequation)∂2Ψ∂x2+qε[p(x)−n(x)+ND−NA+ρp−ρn]=0

(2) (Holecontinuityequation)1q∂Jp∂x=Gop−R(x)

(3) (Electroncontinuityequation)1q∂Jn∂x=−Gop+R(x)

wherein, ε, q, NA, ND, Jp and Jn denote relative dielectric constant, electronic charge, ionized acceptors, donors, current due to holes, and electrons, individually. Farther, Ψ, Gop, R, p, n, ρp, and ρn showcase the electrostatic potential, generation, recombination rate, free holes, electrons, of holes and electrons allocation, in sequence.

Effective density of states (DOS) at conduction band (CB) and effective DOS at valence band (VB) are calculated from Equations (4), (5)) by using the value of the effective mass of electrons (me*) and holes (mh*) [49]:(4) Nv=2(mh*KT2πℏ2)32

(5) Nc=2(me*KT2πℏ2)32

However, the effective mass of electrons and holes of Ag3CuS2 are 0.265 and 0.443, respectively [50].

At the spectrum of 1.5 G AM, this photodetector come on with a power density of 100 mW/cm2. According to Table 1, the thermal velocity of both electrons and holes is 107 (cms−1). The operating temperature in the simulator is set to 300 K. The parameters exerted for BaSi2, WS2 and Ag3CuS2 is acquired from literatures [39,44,50]. The sqrt (.)-Eg with in-built settings is used for reckoning the optical absorption. Table 1 shows the simulation parameters of Ag3CuS2 based photodetector. The photocurrent, photovoltaic, cutoff wavelength, quantum efficiency, and photon energy values are obtained from the single shot calculation. The value of responsivity has been estimated using the photon energy and QE values. The formula below is used to calculate responsivity [45]:(6) R=qηλhc=JSCP0

where, R= Responsivity, h = Planck's constant (6.634 × 10−34 J-s), c = Speed of light (3 × 108 m/s), q = Electronic charge (1.6 × 10−19 C) and P0 is incident optical power.

By the value of R, the value of detectivity can be computed using the following equation [46]:(7) D*=R2qJ0

With J0=JSCeVocVt−1

Where, D = Detectivity, q = 1.602 × 10−19 C, Vt is the thermal voltage and J0 = Dark current.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Ag3CuS2 based PD with & without BSF layer

The current-voltage (J-V) curves of an Ag3CuS2-based photodetector with and without a p+-BaSi2 BSF layer are shown in Fig. 2(a). With the addition of a 200 nm thick p+-BaSi2 BSF layer between the Ag3CuS2 and the Cu back metal connection, the JSC stays constant at 43.45 mA/cm2, but the VOC increases noticeably from 0.66 to 0.74 V. Ag3CuS2/BaSi2 makes a p-p+ heterojunction interface that generates an electric field which serves as a significant obstacle to electron transport to the rear surface. This electron reflection directs the suppression of saturation current and the BSF layer curtails the recombination and magnifies the back surface potential which improves VOC of the Ag3CuS2 photodetector [51,52].Fig. 2 (a) Photocurrent vs. Voltage (b) quantum efficiency (QE) vs. Wavelength and (c) Responsivity vs Wavelength and (d) Detectivity vs. Wavelength characteristic curves of Ag3CuS2 based photodetector with and without BaSi2 BSF.

Fig. 2

Fig. 2(b) illustrates the QE vs. wavelength for Ag3CuS2 based photodetector with and without a p+-BaSi2 back surface. It is perceived that QE exhibits consistent behavior and is unaffected by BaSi2 BSF layer. The QE of the PD is 100 % in the wavelength range of 550–800 nm. Moreover, at wavelengths longer than 1165 nm, QE drops to zero since photon is not absorbed lower the bandgap energy of the absorber in the PD.

The responsivity exhibits consistent characteristics as seen in Fig. 2(c) just as QE does for with and without BSF layer. The greatest values of 0.79 AW-1 and 0.78 AW-1 for responsivity are displayed at 1065 nm with and without BaSi2 layer, respectively.

Fig. 2(d) illustrates the detectivity vs. wavelength for Ag3CuS2 photodetector with and without a p+-BaSi2 BSF layer. The detectivity increases to 4.73 × 1014 Jones from 1 × 1014 Jones when BaSi2 layer is put on the detector. This is due to the fact that carrier recombination falls owing to the development of built-in voltage at the Ag3CuS2/BaSi2 hetero-interface that enhances the VOC and this causes the drop in dark current [53]. Therefore, the detectivity of the Ag3CuS2 PD increases as the dark current falls.

3.2 Effect of Ag3CuS2 absorber layer

3.2.1 Impact of absorber width on Ag3CuS2 PD

In this part, the role of the thickness of Ag3CuS2 photon absorbing layer on the functioning of Ag3CuS2 PD has been illustrated in details. The Ag3CuS2 layer's width is varied between 0.4 and 1.2 μm as shown in Fig. 3(a). In the analysis, the VOC essentially stays constant at 0.74 V. However, further improvement in thickness could result in a higher recombination current and also the effective conveyance of the majority of photogenerated electron-hole pairs to their corresponding electrodes, there is a diminishing impact on the open-circuit voltage (VOC) [54,55]. Nonetheless, JSC rises from 41.18 to 44.43 mA/cm2 in the thickness range under investigation. Whenever the absorber layer elongates, extra photons are get absorbed that clearly enhances the JSC [56].Fig. 3 (a) Photocurrent vs. Voltage (b) QE, (c) Responsivity and (d) Detectivity characteristic curves of Ag3CuS2 photodetector with Ag3CuS2 layer thickness.

Fig. 3

QE versus light wavelength for Ag3CuS2 layer breadths ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 μm is shown in Fig. 3(b). The degree to which a photovoltaic cell will make carriers from the impinged photons of a specific energy is indicated by its quantum efficiency. We find that at longer wavelengths, there is more photon absorption due to the increase in absorber thickness. Relatively longer wavelength photons i.e. low energy photons are absorbed at far distances from the WS2/Ag3CuS2 heterojunction. Therefore, photogenerated carriers increase within the absorber layer with increasing thickness causing the increase in QE in the longer wavelength [57]. In addition, light does not get absorbed lower energy photons, so QE decreases to zero at wavelengths greater than 1165 nm. For all results, a reduction of quantum efficiency is observed at wavelengths less than 550 nm. This is happened as a consequence of the absorption of light in WS2 window layer.

Fig. 3(c) depicts the responsivity versus wavelength for Ag3CuS2 layer widths ranging from 0.4 μm to 1.2 μm. For wavelength of 305–750 nm, the responsivity gradually increase to 0.6AW-1. After 750 nm, the responsivity increases to almost 0.79 AW-1 which referred near-IR region and falls to zero after 1165 nm.

Fig. 3(d) displays the Ag3CuS2 photodetector device's detectivity which has been measured for various absorber layer widths. As the absorber width increases, detectivity rises to a maximum of 4.73 × 1014 Jones for 0.8 μm width at a wavelength of 1065 nm. After that, it falls when the absorber width increases further. This can be explained by the interaction between reducing collection efficiency of photo-carriers with a considerable rise in absorber breadth and increasing QE with increasing absorber width [58].

3.2.2 Role of absorber layer doping on Ag3CuS2 PD

Ag3CuS2 layer carrier concentration is altered from 1015 to 1019 cm−3 in order to analyse the J-V characteristics of proposed structure as outlined in Fig. 4(a). It is evident that Voc rises with acceptor doping concentration from 0.68 to 0.78 V and Jsc menifests consistent behaviour with 43.75 mA/cm2, respectively. Higher doping causes an increase in built-in voltage which raises the Voc. That is happened because of the higher built-in-potential comes into existence at the absorber layer interface [52].Fig. 4 (a) Photocurrent vs. Voltage (b) QE, (c) Responsivity and (d) Detectivity characteristic curves of Ag3CuS2 photodetector with doping of Ag3CuS2 layer.

Fig. 4

Fig. 4(b) illustrates the quantum efficiency vs wavelength for Ag3CuS2 layer doping concentration. It is found that QE exhibits consistent behavior and is unaffected by greater doping concentrations. Moreover, at wavelengths longer than 1165 nm, QE drops to zero since photons with energy less than that of the absorbed bandgap is not absorbed in the PD.

The responsivity exhibits consistent characteristics as seen in Fig. 4(c), just as QE does for all values of doping concentration. The greatest value of responsivity of 0.79 AW-1 is displayed at 1065 nm at a doping of 1017 cm−3.

Detectivity vs wavelength for Ag3CuS2 layer doping concentration is displayed in Fig. 4(d) with a variation from 1015 to 1019 cm−3. The detectivity increases from 1.5 × 1014 to 1 × 1015 Jones as the doping concentration is increased. This comes into being due to the fact that higher value of doping increases the VOC of the device that specifies the reduction in dark current that leads to the increase in detectivity [53]. The optimized device shows a maximum detectivity of 4.73 × 1014 Jones at a wavelength of 1065 nm with doping concentration of 1017 cm−3.

3.2.3 Mastery of defects of absorber layer on Ag3CuS2 PD

The concentration of bulk defect in Ag3CuS2 layer is varied from 1012 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3 in order to analyse the J-V characteristics of the designed PD structure as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). Here, the JSC shows about an unchanged behavior with little alteration from 43.8 to 43.04 mA/cm2 owing to the rise in defects. As the absorption of photons can be hampered by the larger amount defects and consequences the smaller rate of generating electron-hole pairs, the device current will under go a reduction owing to the escalation of recombination current. VOC downfalls quickly by the rise in recombination current [59]. This phenomenon of the VOC takes place due to the minority carrier lifetime and diffusion length are higher in this range of defect in the Ag3CuS2 PD [60]. Although photocurrent manifests a constant nature in the entire range of defect densities, the device voltage degrades successively as observed in the figure. For the volume defects of 1016 cm−3, VOC abates from 0.76 to 0.62 V.Fig. 5 (a) Photocurrent vs. Voltage (b) QE, (c) Responsivity and (d) Detectivity characteristic curves of Ag3CuS2 based photodetector with defects in Ag3CuS2 layer.

Fig. 5

Fig. 5(b) illustrates the quantum efficiency vs wavelength for Ag3CuS2 layer defect concentration which is adjusted from 1012 to 1016 cm−3. It is discovered that QE exhibits consistent behavior and is unaffected by greater defect concentrations.

Detectivity vs. wavelength for Ag3CuS2 layer defect concentration is displayed in Fig. 5(d) with a variation from 1012 to 1016 cm−3. The detectivity decreases from 6.96 × 1014 to 4.59 × 1013 Jones as the defect concentration is increased. This is due to the fact that recombination rises as defect concentration rises, leading to a rise in dark current [53]. Detectivity falls when dark current increases. The optimized Ag3CuS2 PD device shows a maximum detectivity of 4.73 × 1014 Jones at a wavelength of 1065 nm with defect concentration of 1014 cm−3.

3.3 Effect of WS2 buffer layer

3.3.1 Impact of WS2 layer thickness on Ag3CuS2 photodetector

Fig. 6(a) shows the dominance of the variation of WS2 window on the operation of Ag3CuS2 PD. The width of the WS2 layer fluctuates between 0.05 and 0.25 μm. Although, the VOC remains constant at 0.74 V but JSC lessens from 43.99 to 42.87 mA/cm2 within this thickness range. This is because the thickness of the window (WS2) layer increases parasitic absorption which perturbs photons at higher wavelengths so they cannot reach the absorber layer and reduces output current [61].Fig. 6 (a) Photocurrent vs. Voltage (b) QE, (c) Responsivity and (d) Detectivity characteristic curves of Ag3CuS2 photodetector with WS2 layer width.

Fig. 6

Fig. 6(b) illustrates the quantum efficiency vs. wavelength for WS2 layer width which is adjusted from 0.05 to 0.25 μm. It is visualized from the figure that QE exhibits constant behavior and is unaffected by higher thickness values above 0.25 μm. Additionally, at wavelengths longer than 1165 nm, QE drops to zero. However, at the shorter wavelength, the QE drops when the thickness of the WS2 layer rises. This phenomenon occurs due to absorption of light in the window layer which could be called window gain [62]. Moreover, the decrease in quantum efficiency for shorter wavelengths with increased thickness of the window layer is attributed to increase in recombination in the WS2 layer as higher thickness absorbs more photons that reduces JSC as well as QE of the devices [63].

The responsivity exhibits consistent characteristics as depicted in Fig. 6(c). The greatest value of responsivity of 0.79 AW-1 is displayed at 1065 nm wavelength of light when the width of WS2 window is 0.1 μm.

Detectivity vs. wavelength for WS2 layer thickness is displayed in Fig. 6(d) within the range of 0.05–0.25 μm. The detectivity insignificantly increases from 4.72 × 1014 to 4.78 × 1014 Jones with the increasing of thickness. The detectivity shows an almost constant value for the width of the buffer layer in the Jalpaite PD.

3.3.2 Impact of WS2 layer doping on Ag3CuS2 photodetector

Fig. 7(a) delineates the role of doping concentration of the WS2 layer on the functioning of Ag3CuS2 PD. WS2 layer doping, ND is changed from 1016 to 1020 cm−3 in order to investigate the J-V characteristics of the PD structure. In this range, the JSC is slightly decreased from 44.06 to 42.18 mA/cm2 due to increasing of parasitic absorption which means higher recombination rate of electron-hole pairs (EHPs) and the VOC shows a slight increase from 0.74 to 0.75 V following the doping [52]. This kind of situation arises because doping raises intrinsic potential which lowers dark current [59].Fig. 7 (a) Photocurrent vs. Voltage (b) QE, (c) Responsivity and (d) Detectivity characteristic curves of Ag3CuS2 based photodetector with WS2 layer doping.

Fig. 7

Fig. 7(b) illustrates the quantum efficiency vs. wavelength for WS2 layer doping concentration which is adjusted from 1016 to 1020 cm−3. It is observed that QE exhibits consistent behavior and is unaffected by greater doping concentrations. For ND values of 1016 and 1017cm−3, the QE is 100 % for wavelength of 550–750 nm. Notably, for shorter wavelengths, the quantum efficiency is decreased with the increased of doping level. This is happened because the higher donor can increase the recombination current in the window layer that reduces JSC and QE [63,64]. In an addition to this, at wavelengths longer than 1165 nm, QE drops to nil.

The responsivity exhibits consistent characteristics as delimitated in Fig. 7(c), just as QE does for all values of doping of WS2 layer. The greatest value of 0.79 AW-1 for responsivity is displayed at 1065 nm at ND of 1018 cm−3.

Detectivity vs wavelength for WS2 layer doping concentration is displayed in Fig. 7(d). The detectivity marginaly increases from 4.72 × 1014 to 4.83 × 1014 Jones as the doping, ND is uprised due to the climb in VOC which indicates the fall in dark current with doping [53]. The detectivity remains at almost constant value for the doping of the buffer layer in the Jalpaite PD.

3.3.3 Impact of WS2 layer defect on Ag3CuS2 PD

Fig. 8(a) expresses the variation in J-V characteristics with WS2 layer defects that have been varied from 1012 to 1016 cm−3 to analyse the PD structure. Here, the JSC and VOC have shown constant behavior with a value of 43.79 mA/cm2 and 0.74 V, respectively with the increase in bulk defects of WS2 buffer layer.Fig. 8 (a) Photocurrent vs Voltage (b) QE, (c) Responsivity and (d) Detectivity characteristic curves of Ag3CuS2 based photodetector with WS2 layer defects.

The responsivity exhibits consistent characteristics just as QE does as seen in Fig. 10(c). The highest value of 0.79 AW-1 for responsivity is displayed at 1065 nm at doping of 1019 cm−3.

Detectivity variation with BaSi2 layer doping concentration is displayed in Fig. 10(d) in the doping range from 1017 to 1021 cm−3. The detectivity shows consistant behaviour with the increasing of doping concentration. The gratest value of detectivity is 4.73 × 1014 Jones at 1065 nm obtained with doping concentration of 1019 cm−3.

3.4.3 Influence of BaSi2 BSF defects on Ag3CuS2 PD

Defect concentration of the BaSi2 layer is changed from 1012 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3 in order to examine the J-V properties of the suggested PD structure as seen in Fig. 11(a). In this range, the VOC and JSC show constant behavior at 0.74 V and 43.8 mA/cm2, respectively with the defect concentration.Fig. 11 (a) Photocurrent vs. Voltage (b) QE, (c) Responsivity and (d) Detectivity characteristic curve of Ag3CuS2 based photodetector with BaSi2 layer defects.

Fig. 11

Fig. 11(b) illustrates the quantum efficiency vs. wavelength for WS2 layer defect concentration which is altered from 1012 to 1016 cm−3. It is visualized that QE exhibits steady behavior and is unaffected by greater defect concentrations.

The responsivity exhibits consistent characteristics just as QE does with defects as seen in Fig. 11(c) The highest values of 0.79 AW-1 for responsivity is displayed at 1065 nm with defects of 1014 cm−3.

Detectivity variation with BaSi2 BSF layer's doping concentration is displayed in Fig. 11(d). The variation of doping concentration is observed at the range of 1017 to 1021 cm−3. The detectivity shows steady behaviour with the increasing of defect concentration. The gratest value of detectivity obtained is 4.73 × 1014 Jones at 1065 nm with defect concentration of 1014 cm−3.

3.5 Impression of resistances on Ag3CuS2 PD

Fig. 12 (a) and (b) show the fluctuations of JSC and VOC with the variations of series and shunt resistances of the PD device, respectively. The body and contacts of a cell provide the series resistance, but various fabrication flaws that cause leakage current at the junctions are in charge of the shunt resistance [65]. The variation of JSC and VOC in the range of 0–20 Ω cm2 is depicted in Fig. 12(a) along with the variation of series resistance. It can be observed that the VOC stay constant at 0.74 V and JSC constant until 12 Ω cm2, then dropping from 43.7 to 34.2 mA/cm2 with additional series resistance. On the other hand, the device's shunt resistance ranges from 1 to 20 kΩ cm2 shown in Fig. 11(b). The figure describes how both VOC and JSC exhibit continuous behaviour at 0.74 V and 43.7 mA/cm2 with shunt resistance.Fig. 12 Variation in photocurrent and Voltage with (a) series and (b) shunt resistances of Ag3CuS2 based photodetector.

4 Conclusion

This study reports on the performance examination of the Ag3CuS2 based photodetector for a variety of electrical and optical characteristics, including quantum efficiency, open circuit voltage, responsivity, and detectivity. The photodetector provides a short circuit current of JSC = 43.79 mA/cm2, responsivity of R = 0.79 AW-1, and detectivity of D* = 4.73 × 1014 Jones, according to the simulation results. The Ag3CuS2 PD exhibits significant promise as a potential replacement for other heterojunction-based photodetectors. The results prove this material as a futuristic one to detect NIR wavelengths within a single framework and unveil the potentiality of this newly jalpaite. Its remarkable capability positions it as a favorable one for practical applications.
