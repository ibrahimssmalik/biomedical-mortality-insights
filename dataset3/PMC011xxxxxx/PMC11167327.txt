Background

Cabera pusaria is a moth in the family Geometridae, the second largest family of macro-moths in the British Isles, and like most of the members of this family has a thin body and triangular wings ( Waring & Townsend, 2017). It has white wings with grey cross-lines, and can be distinguished from the similar Common Wave Cabera exanthemata by the straightness of the outer cross-lines towards the leading edge of the wing, compared to the curved lines in C. exanthemata ( Skinner, 2009; Waring & Townsend, 2017).

C. pusaria is found throughout the British Isles where it is often disturbed from vegetation during the day and comes to light in small numbers, flying between late-May and early-September in the south where it is double-brooded and from May to July in the north where it is single-brooded. The larvae feed on a range of trees – including Downy Birch Betula pubescens, Silver Birch Betula pendula, Sallow Salix spp., Alder Alnus spp., Oak Quercus spp., and Sweet Chestnut Castanea sativa - from July to September, before pupating to overwinter ( Skinner, 2009; Waring & Townsend, 2017).

While trace elements are important in the diet, high doses of the heavy metal manganese are fatal to the larvae and pupae of C. pusaria ( Martinek et al., 2020), however, the larvae were the most numerous species on Birch Betula pendula in an area of the Czech Republic polluted by sulphur dioxide where they are considered pests ( Kula et al., 2005).

We present a chromosomally complete genome sequence for Cabera pusaria, based on one male specimen collected using a mercury vapour light trap in a rural garden in the hamlet of Bratton, near Minehead, in Somerset, as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project. This project is a collaborative effort to sequence all named eukaryotic species in the Atlantic Archipelago of Britain and Ireland.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one male Cabera pusaria ( Figure 1) collected from Bratton, Somerset, UK (51.20, –3.51). A total of 27-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 30 missing joins or mis-joins, reducing the assembly length by 0.75% and the scaffold number by 5.08%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Cabera pusaria (ilCabPusa1) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 794.3 Mb in 55 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 27.5 Mb ( Table 1). The snailplot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of assembly scaffolds on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (99.72%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 31 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 30 autosomes and the Z sex chromosome. Chromosome Z was assigned based on synteny to Petrophora chlorosata (GCA_951640565.1). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

The specimens used in this study were collected in a light trap in a garden in Bratton, Somerset, UK (latitude 51.20, longitude –3.51) on 2022-06-20. The specimens were collected and identified by Denise Wawman (University of Oxford) and were snap-frozen on dry ice. The specimen with ID Ox002230 (ToLID ilCabPusa1) was used for DNA sequencing, while the specimen with ID Ox002236 (ToLID ilCabPusa2) was used for Hi-C analysis and RNA sequencing.

The ilCabPusa1 sample was prepared for DNA extraction at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The specimen was weighed and dissected on dry ice with tissue set aside for Hi-C sequencing. Head and thorax tissue was disrupted using a Nippi Powermasher fitted with a BioMasher pestle. DNA was extracted at the WSI Scientific Operations core using the Qiagen MagAttract HMW DNA kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

RNA was extracted from head tissue of ilCabPusa2 in the Tree of Life Laboratory at the WSI using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was then eluted in 50 μl RNAse-free water and its concentration assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit RNA Broad-Range (BR) Assay kit. Analysis of the integrity of the RNA was done using Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit and Eukaryotic Total RNA assay.

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Poly(A) RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the NEB Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit. DNA and RNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (RNA-Seq) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from head tissue of ilCabPusa2 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

The manuscript describes the obtention of the genome of  Cabera pusaria at the chromosome level.

The genome of  C pusaria could be used for the study of lepidopteran adaptation to heavy metal. Genomic comparison of the populations showing different level of tolerance to heavy metal could also be performed. Martinek et al 2020 [Ref- 1] described a population of  C pusaria able to eliminate excess of the heavy metal manganese. More genomic formation are needed to understand how insect populations adapt to polluted environment (Kozlov,2022) [Ref- 2]

A complete genome publication should propose a gene annotation that is still missing here. I suggest to update the article with this data.

Once, gene annotations will be available, it will be possible to determine which detoxification pathway are involved in the excretion of manganese.  What genome modification have led to the capacities of some  C pusaria populations to survive on high concentration of heavy metals? Are these genomic regions already involved in adaptation of lepidopteran to anthropisation of the environment?

I have other questions that could help understand the data presented in this manuscript.

Could you explain why some "no hit data" in figure3 have the same GC contents as  C pusaria? How could you differentiate these scaffolds from the  C pusaria genome scaffold?

Where you able to find DNA from bacteria, fungi or viruses that could also give information of this insect physiology? Could you give the main origine of these contaminants.

Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?

Partly

Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?

Yes

Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?

Are the protocols appropriate and is the work technically sound?

Denise C. Wawman presents a report on the complete genome assembly of Cabera pusaria. The assembly was generated from a single male individual, with 99.72% of the sequences assigned to 31 chromosomes using Hi-C data. This work is a valuable addition to the growing collection of Lepidoptera genome assemblies and will be very helpful to the community.

I have only a few minor suggestions:

1. The author mentioned that annotation will be done using the Ensembl pipeline with the collected RNA-Seq data. It would be appreciated if the author could include the annotation information once it's ready, along with the BUSCO score obtained using protein sequences from the annotation, in the revision.

2. The author mentioned that Chromosome Z was assigned based on synteny to Petrophora chlorosata. It would be helpful to include a line or two on how the synteny analysis was conducted and the level of synteny observed between the two species.

Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?

Yes

Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?
