We present a genome assembly from an individual male Mythimna albipuncta (the White-point; Arthropoda; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Noctuidae). The genome sequence is 698.6 megabases in span. Most of the assembly is scaffolded into 31 chromosomal pseudomolecules, including the Z sex chromosome. The mitochondrial genome has also been assembled and is 15.38 kilobases in length. Gene annotation of this assembly on Ensembl identified 13,679 protein coding genes.

Background

Mythimna albipuncta, the White-point, is a moth in the family Noctuidae found across much of central and northern Europe, with scattered records from Ukraine, Estonia, Russia, Tunisia and Morocco ( GBIF Secretariat, 2023). The adult moth has ochreous-brown forewings with indistinct markings apart from a conspicuous white spot in the position of the reniform stigma. It can be distinguished from the similar Clay moth, Mythimna farrago ( Boyes et al., 2022), by a less elongated forewing shape and by the white spot being either diamond-shaped or rounded.

Through most of the twentieth century, the species was not a resident breeding species in Britain, but was recorded as an infrequent immigrant species along the south and east coasts. There was evidence of a second brood produced by early summer migrant moths in southern counties such as Dorset ( Davey, 2009). In the past twenty years numbers of records have increased dramatically; for example, in Norfolk there were just 4 records in 2000, but this number increased to almost 4000 records in 2021 ( NorfolkMoths, 2023). The increase in recording frequency, seen in all southern counties of Britain, is attributed to widespread establishment as a resident breeding species, supplemented by ongoing influx of migrant individuals from France and Spain ( Davey, 2009).

The larvae of M. albipuncta feed on various species of grass including cock’s-foot ( Dactylus glomerata), overwintering at the larval stage. Hibernation is clearly not obligatory, as a second brood can occur in summer in Britain ( Davey, 2009) and in captivity adults can be reared from the egg in 2 to 3 months ( Heath & Emmet, 1983).

The genome sequence of Mythimna albipuncta was determined and assembled as part of the Darwin Tree of Life project. The complete genome sequence will contribute to the growing set of resources for studying molecular evolution in the Lepidoptera.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one male Mythimna albipuncta ( Figure 1) collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (51.77, –1.34). A total of 37-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads and 57-fold coverage in 10X Genomics read clouds was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 7 missing joins or mis-joins and removed one haplotypic duplication, reducing the scaffold number by 5.71%, and increasing the scaffold N50 by 0.44%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Mythimna albipuncta (ilMytAlbi1) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 698.6 Mb in 33 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 23.9 Mb ( Table 1). The snailplot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of assembly scaffolds on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (99.98%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 31 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 30 autosomes and the Z sex chromosome. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Genome annotation report

The Mythimna albipuncta genome assembly (GCA_929112965.1) was annotated using the Ensembl rapid annotation pipeline ( Table 1; https://rapid.ensembl.org/Mythimna_albipuncta_GCA_929112965.1/Info/Index). The resulting annotation includes 25,614 transcribed mRNAs from 13,679 protein-coding and 3,250 non-coding genes.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

A male Mythimna albipuncta (specimen ID Ox000960, ToLID ilMytAlbi1) was collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire (biological vice-county Berkshire), UK (latitude 51.77, longitude –1.34) on 2020-09-08 using a light trap. The specimen was collected and identified by Douglas Boyes (University of Oxford) and snap-frozen on dry ice.

The workflow for high molecular weight (HMW) DNA extraction at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI) includes a sequence of core procedures: sample preparation; sample homogenisation, DNA extraction, fragmentation, and clean-up. In sample preparation, the ilMytAlbi1 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice ( Jay et al., 2023). Tissue from the thorax was homogenised using a PowerMasher II tissue disruptor ( Denton et al., 2023a). HMW DNA was extracted using the Automated MagAttract v1 protocol ( Sheerin et al., 2023). The DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30 ( Todorovic et al., 2023). Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation ( Strickland et al., 2023): in brief, the method employs a 1.8X ratio of AMPure PB beads to sample to eliminate shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

Protocols developed by the WSI Tree of Life core laboratory have been deposited on protocols.io ( Denton et al., 2023b).

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus and 10X Genomics read cloud DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (10X) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from head tissue of ilMytAlbi1 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). One round of polishing was performed by aligning 10X Genomics read data to the assembly with Long Ranger ALIGN, calling variants with FreeBayes ( Garrison & Marth, 2012). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using SALSA2 ( Ghurye et al., 2019). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

Genome annotation

The Ensembl gene annotation system ( Aken et al., 2016) was used to generate annotation for the Mythimna albipuncta assembly (GCA_929112965.1). Annotation was created primarily through alignment of transcriptomic data to the genome, with gap filling via protein-to-genome alignments of a select set of proteins from UniProt ( UniProt Consortium, 2019).

Boyes et al. have completed the genome assembly and annotation of the White-point moth ( Mythimna albipuncta). After providing a background on the biology and recent natural history of the White-point moth, they describe in detail their standard protocol for genome assembly, which is consistent with other reports from the Darwin's Tree of Life project. They provide details on the sampling, protocols, and resulting assemblies. The resulting assembly, which is high-quality, complete, and contiguous, is already deposited in public databases.

I only need clarification on the below points: Both chromosome number and genome size vary dramatically in Lepidoptera (1,2). I have not found previous estimations of genome size, so how was the coverage needed for sequencing determined?

I also did not find any karyotype description for this species. If only one male was sequenced, how can the authors identify the Z sex chromosome?

Boyes, Holland and colleagues present the genome assembly and annotation of the White-point moth ( Mythimna albipuncta). The report follows the DtOL template, with systematic and comprehensive reporting of protocols, sample and assembly properties and metadata and appropriate deposition of resources in public databases. The assembly is a high-quality resource, with excellent contiguity, completeness and accuracy properties. The natural history background is knowledgeable and engaging and this genomic resource will be of value to the scientific community.

Minor comments:

I would prefer that the location collection co-ordinates be given their longitude and latitude qualifiers (they are in the methods, but not in the initial genome sequence report).

I have repeatedly raised in these Data Note reviews that I believe there is an error in the PB-AMPure bead ratio reported for the clean-up of sheared DNA. In my understanding this is a 0.6x ratio of beads to sample volume, not 1.8x as stated in the template.

I would also prefer to see the k-mer size used in MerquryFK estimates of genome properties noted, along with some details of other non-default parameter settings, for example in mapping HiC reads with BWA, though I will acknowledge that this information will be contained within the Zenodo Nextflow  workflow archives.

The genome of the White-point  Mythimna albipuncta (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775) was sequenced with appropriate techniques and assembled using standard software. Through the genome annotation authors have identified protein-coding genes, non-coding genes and gene transcripts.

Some minor comments

The authors have given the genus name  Mythimna albipuncta full form throughout the article. First time the genus name should be given in full form then subsequently can be given in short form like  M. albipuncta in the entire article.

Table number and title for table 3 was given in between the text in page number 9. I think it may be incorrect. The table number and title can be deleted or replaced. 

In the background of the manuscript third paragraph first line after comma “overwintering at the larval stage” is not giving proper meaning at end of the sentence. It can be rewritten.

Last sentence of the fourth paragraph in the background can be modified as “The complete genome sequence will contribute to the growing set of resources for phylogenomic analysis in the order Lepidoptera”.

Above all, I confirm that the manuscript meets the necessary scientific standard and is suitable for indexing"

Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?

Yes

Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?

Yes

Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?

Yes

Are the protocols appropriate and is the work technically sound?

Yes
