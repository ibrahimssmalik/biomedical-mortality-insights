Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) chip thermistors were thermally coupled to form a novel device (TCCT) aimed for application in microelectronics. It consists of two NTC chip thermistors Th1 and Th2, which are small in size (0603) and power (1/10 W). They are in thermal junction, but concurrently they are electrically isolated. The first thermistor Th1 generates heat as a self-heating component at a constant supply voltage U (input thermistor), while the second thermistor Th2 receives heat as a passive component (output thermistor). The temperature dependence R(T) of NTC chip thermistors was measured in the climatic test chamber, and the exponential factor B10/30 of thermistor resistance was determined. After that, a self–heating current I1 of the input thermistor was measured vs. supply voltage U and ambient temperature Ta as a parameter. Input resistance R1 was determined as a ratio of U and I1 while output thermistor resistance R2 was measured by a multimeter concurrently with the current I1. Temperatures T1 and T2 of both thermistors were determined using the Steinhart–Hart equation. Heat transfer, thermal response, stability, and inaccuracy were analyzed. The application of thermally coupled NTC chip thermistors is expected in microelectronics for the input to output electrical decoupling/thermal coupling of slow changeable signals.

pmc1. Introduction

A thermistor is a type of resistor, the resistance of which can have a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) or negative temperature coefficient (NTC), i.e., it increases or decreases its resistance with the temperature increase. Typical thermistor geometries are the disk, chip, and thick film. The resistance values, temperature range, and temperature coefficient B depend on the semiconductor oxides used for their preparation [1,2]. They are mass-produced by pressing thermistor powders in molds and after that, sintering compacts the thermistor at different temperatures in air [3,4]. NTC thermistors are divided into two groups: low temperature application range thermistors (−50 °C to +250 °C) [5,6] and high temperature application range thermistors for +250 °C to +1000 °C [7,8]. The semiconductive oxides used in the production of low temperature application range NTC thermistors are based on nickel manganese spinel and its modifications such as NiMn2O4, (NiMn)3O4, (NiMnCo)3O4, (NiMnFeCo)3O4, and (Fe,Ti)2O3. They are usually doped by a low percentage of oxides such as CuO, ZnO, CoO, LiO, RuO2, ZrO2, Y2O3, and other oxides to form complex thermistor materials [9,10,11,12,13,14]. The nickel manganese spinel is partly inverse as the tetrahedral ion Ni2+ and octahedral ion Mn3+ can exchange their sites in the lattice. Octahedral ions can change their valence such as 2Mn3+→(Mn2+, Mn4+). In that way, the Mn2+ ion fits the vacancy in the lattice where ion Ni2+ is missing. The main carriers in NiMn2O4 are small polarons (partly polarized) electrons and the energy gap has a relatively low value (around 0.5 eV) [15,16,17,18]. The disk and chip NTC thermistors for the low temperature application range are pressed out of NiMn2O4 powder in molds and sintered at 1100 °C to 1200 °C/2 h in air [19,20]. The electrodes for disk and chip thermistors are printed out of thick film conductive PdAg paste on both sides. After that, they are dried at 150 °C/10 min and sintered at 850 °C/10 min in air [21,22]. The semiconductive oxides used in the production of NTC thermistors fora higher temperature application range are based on BaTiO3, Fe2TiO5, Co3O4, CaTiO3, Mg(Al1−xCrx)2O4, Bi2Zr3O7, ZrO2/CaO, and complex oxides such as MgAl2O4–LaCr0.5Mn0.5O3, Ni1.0Mn2−xZrxO4, Ce1.2(1−x)Mn1−xSix, Sr7Mn4O15, etc. [23,24,25,26,27,28,29].

A chip thermistor is a leadless component designed for surface mounting technology (SMT). It is small in size and small in power and serves for the measurement of the temperature in the measuring point in air, liquids, the ground, and solid bodies. Their outlook and thermal coupling are given in Figure 1.

A novel chip TCCT device is based on NTC chip thermistors. The thermistors were joined laterally using epoxy resin, i.e., they are thermally coupled through epoxy but they are electrically decoupled (galvanically insulated). The input thermistor Th1 serves as a self-heating thermistor powered by DC or AC voltage U, while the output thermistor Th2 acts as a heat receiver and changes its higher electrical resistance R2. The main property of the chip TCCT device is that the temperature of the output chip thermistor follows the temperature of the input self-heating chip thermistor. Moreover, the input and output thermistors are galvanically isolated and the electrical noise caused by switching power electronics is not transferred from the input to output thermistor. The comparatively low (electrical) coupling capacity between the two NTCs and (2) their thermal inertia allows (1) to reduce the disturbing influence of the voltage or current peaks on the temperature measurement and (2) to smoothen the ripple of the temperature signal. The output thermistor can be connected to an operational amplifier and used in different ways: feedback to input power, output temperature to input power convertor, electro-thermal potentiometers, etc. In comparison to the thick film (TF) TCT device with segmented thermistors and disk TCDT device which were realized recently in our previous work [30,31], the TCCT device has the following advantages: it occupies the smallest surface and has a simpler construction, lower cost, smaller power, and a high availability of chip thermistors with different nominal resistances, which is suitable for the realization of different resistance ratios in a thermal coupling device.

2. Experiment and Results

2.1. Main Properties of Chip Thermistors

The chip thermistors given in Figure 1a (EPCOS NTC 0603, TDK Europe, Munchen, Germany) have the following main properties: a dissipation power of 1/10 W, nominal resistance of around 2600 Ω at a room temperature of 25 °C, and exponential factor B25/75 ≈ 3900 K (given by the producer). For our experiments, nominal resistance was additionally measured at 20 °C and B10/30 was determined in the range of 10 °C to 30 °C. Electrical resistance R was measured in the climatic test chamber with the temperature increase T as the temperature behavior R(T) of the NTC chip thermistor and given in Figure 2. It can be approximated bythe Steinhart–Hart equation in the first article (1) [32]: (1) R(T)=R0exp[−B·(1T0−1T)]

Resistance R0 is the nominal value of the chip resistor at 20 °C, T0 is the room temperature at 20 °C (293,16 K), B is the exponential temperature coefficient of the chip thermistor, and T is the current temperature of the thermistor. The thermistor exponential factor B was obtained in the vicinity of room temperature using the values of chip resistance R10 and R30 measured at temperatures T10 = 10 °C and T30 = 30 °C, respectively. The thermistor exponential factor B is derived from Equation (1) and given in Equation (2):(2) B=[T10·T30T30−T10]·ln[R10R30]

Using Equation (2) and the results in Figure 2, the chip thermistor coefficient was determined as B10/30 = 3908.3 K. Nominal resistance at 20 °C was measured with the digital multimeter Fluke 179 as R = 2680 Ω. Also, using Equations (1) and (2), the unknown current temperature T of the thermistor is a function of current thermistor resistance R. In that way, the temperature T1 of the self-heating thermistor Th1 (input thermistor) is a function of resistance R1, coefficient B1, and can be calculated by Equation (3):(3) T1=[(B1·T0/(B1+T0ln(R1R01)))]

whereas resistance R1 = U/I1 is the resistance of the self-heating thermistor Th1 (input resistance) and R01 is the nominal value of thermistor Th1 measured at 20 °C. Hence, thermistor Th2 in the thermally coupled device has temperature T2 calculated by thermistor resistance R2, coefficient B2, and is given in Equation (4):(4) T2=[(B2·T0/(B2+T0ln(R2R02)))]

The electrical resistance R2 of thermistor Th2 is measured using a multimeter in the climatic test chamber, and R02 is the thermistor nominal value measured at 20 °C. In our partial case, Th1 and Th2 were made out of the same material and B1 = B2 = B and R01 ≈ R02. Before the measurement of thermistor resistance, the climatic test chamber was twice recalibrated by a PT-1000 platinum thermometer to lower the inaccuracy of measuring temperature T to around ±0.020 °C.

2.2. Thermal Coupling of Chip Thermistors

At first, thin wire leads were soldered onto the chip thermistors and then the chip thermistors were insulated using epoxy resin. Finally, a pair of insulated chip thermistors were placed in lateral contact and joined together using a thin layer of epoxy between them to form the TCCT device as given in Figure 1b,c. The main properties of the TCCT device were measured in the climatic test chamber. The measuring setup is given in Figure 3; it consists of thermally coupled chip thermistors TCCT and three multimeters used for the measuring of the input supply voltage U, self-heating current I1 of thermistor Th1, and output resistance R2 of thermistor Th2.

The self-heating current I1 of thermistor Th1 in the TCCT device vs. supply voltage U was measured at different ambient temperatures Ta as a parameter in the range from 0 °C to 40 °C (in steps of 5 °C). The supply voltage U was increased in steps of 1 V each 20 s to observe the behavior of the self-heating process. The input power P1 = U∙I1 of the self-heating thermistor Th1 was defined for different ambient temperatures Ta in the climatic test chamber, which was also changed in steps of 5 °C. The results of these measurements are given in Figure 4.

2.3. Resistances and Temperatures in TCCT Device

The resistance R1 of the chip thermistor Th1 is defined from the self-heating current I1 and supply voltage U as R1 = U/I1, while the resistance R2 of the chip thermistor Th2 is measured by a multimeter at the same time as U and I1. The results of these measurements are given in Figure 5.

The temperatures T1 and T2 of the chip thermistors Th1 and Th2, respectively, are defined using Equations (3) and (4), and the values of the resistances R1 and R2 are given above in Figure 5. The ambient temperature Ta was used a parameter. The obtained results are given in Figure 6.

2.4. Self-Heating Current Stability vs. Time of TCCT Device

Using the same measuring setup as given in Figure 3, the behavior of the self-heating current I1 of the chip thermistor Th1 vs. time t from the switch on moment (t = 0) of the fixed supply voltage U was measured. The supply voltage U was changed as a parameter in steps of 1 V in the climatic test chamber. The I1 curves from the switch on to saturation level are given in Figure 7. The delay time from the switch on supply voltage U marked as td ≈ 30 s was estimated from the behavior of the self-heating current I1(t) in Figure 7 in the region below the knee for a bundle of curves. The criterion of the stability of I1 in the horizontal region was introduced as k = I(t = 40)/I(t = 80) > 0.97. Using this criterion of stability, the bar diagram in Figure 7 was formed for the values of the supply voltage U and self-heating current I1 to follow the criterion k > 0.97 in the ambient temperature range from 0 °C to 40 °C.

The self-heating cycle from t = 0 s to t = 180 s and the cooling cycle from t = 180 s to t = 360 s for the TCCT device was measured using the same measuring setup as given in Figure 3 and the fixed input supply voltage U = 8 V at ambient temperature Ta = 20 °C. The resistances R1 and R2 and temperatures T1 and T2 of the chip thermistors Th1 and Th2, respectively, are given in Figure 8.

2.5. Application of TCCT Device

The applications of the TCCT device with thermally coupled/electrically insulated chip thermistors are related to microelectronics. For example, two applications with TCCT are proposed and given in Figure 9. Block schemes A and B can be classified as voltage dividers/slider-less potentiometers or an electro-thermal potentiometer limited with a factor of stability of k > 0.97 (without a moving part known as the slider) based on chip thermistors Th1 and Th2, and the input voltage U on thermistor Th1 governs with electrical resistance R2 in thermistor Th2 via generated and transferred heat (thermal route). In the other block scheme in Figure 9, the resistance R2 of thermistor Th2 of the TCCT device is placed in a modified bridge with an operation amplifierIC1 (TLV 9002) for the linearization of the output Vout. The fixed resistor in the bridge, such as the 1.5 kΩ resistor placed in parallel with a 1 kΩ resistor +5 kΩ potentiometer, is chosen based on the nominal value of the NTC chip thermistor Th2 and the temperature range. A parallel connected capacitor such as the 100 nF with a fixed resistor of 1.5 kΩ (input to output feedback) limits bandwidth, improves stability, and helps to reduce noise. The range of temperature T2 linearization is room temperature 20 °C ± 25 °C. The bridge enables a temperature to voltage conversion Vout = F(T2) and power to voltage conversion Vout = F(P1). Other applications are related to the control of small power AC/DC converters, thermostat function in air conditioning equipment, level detection, LED switching, etc.

The electro-thermal potentiometer functions A and B are given in Equations (5) and (6), respectively:(5) A:Vout=R0R0+R2·V

(6) B:Vout=R2R0+R2·V

Output resistance R2 = f(U), R0—chosen fixed resistor, R0 = R2 only at room temperature.

The input supply voltage U governs with the self-heating current I1 in the thermistor Th1 and generates heat P1 transferred to the thermistor Th2, which governs with electrical resistance R2, and output temperature T2. Consequently, T2 is a function of P1 and P1(T2) given in Figure 10, and is used to measure input power as a function of output temperature. Hence, the TCCT in the bridge configuration enables a temperature to voltage conversion Vout = F(T2) and power to voltage conversion Vout = F(P1).

The function P1 = F(T2) given in Figure 10 consists of measured curves (solid curves), for which each step of ambient temperature Ta was around 5 °C, and interpolated curves, each 1 °C of T2 as auxiliary curves (dashed curves). They were interpolated between two measured (solid) curves by using a polynomial of the third order as given in Equations (7) and (8). (7) P1=a0+a1·T2+a2·T22; Ta=25 °C

(8) P1=b0+b1·T2+b2·T22; Ta=20 °C

The dashed curves are introduced gradually with Pn polynomials n = 1,2, … 4, as given by Equation (9):(9) P1n=(b0+n·Δ0)+(b1+n·Δ1)·T2+(b2+n·Δ2)·T22

Δ0=(a0−b0)/5; Δ1=(a1−b1)/5; Δ2=(a2−b2)/5

∆—increments of polynomial coefficients: n = 1,2 … 4.

The function P1 = F(T2) given in Figure 10 consists of measured curves (solid curves), each around 5 °C of ambient temperature Ta, and interpolated curves, each 1 °C of T2 as auxiliary curves (dashed curves). They were interpolated between two measured (solid) curves by using a polynomial of the third order as given in Equations (7) and (8).

The described application is related to the control of small power AC/DC converters using the function P1 = F(T2) given in Figure 10. Other applications have to be developed using the applications’ electro-thermal potentiometers and bridges for the linearization of the output temperature T2 in Figure 9.

3. Discussion

3.1. Operating Point of TCCT Device

Small NTC chip thermistors 0603 (EPCOS), as given in Figure 1, with a dissipation power of 1/10 W, nominal resistance ofaround 2680 Ω at 20 °C, and exponential factor B = 3908 K, were used in the forming of thermally coupled chip thermistors—the TCCT device—for the first time. The slope of the chip thermistor NTC curve is moderate (Figure 2). The input supply voltage U of the self-heating thermistor Th1 (Figure 3) enables the self-heating current I1 and generates power P1, which are of an exponential/logarithmic type, as given in Figure 4. The chip thermistor Th2 is only a heat receiver (passive thermistor). The resistances R1 and R2 of the chip thermistors Th1 and Th2 are also of an exponential/logarithmic type dependent on the supply voltage U and ambient temperature Ta as a parameter, as given in Figure 5. The temperatures T1 and T2 of the chip thermistors Th1 and Th2, respectively, are also dependent on the supply voltage U and ambient temperature Ta (as presented in Figure 6). The curves of T1 are more exponential compared to the curves of T2 as the heat generated in Th1 or power P1 with input temperature T1 is only partly transferred to the thermistor Th2 through the epoxy resinto cause an appearance of output temperature T2 on the thermistor Th2. As a consequence, the chip thermistor Th2 (heat receiver) has a much lower temperature T2 compared to T1. The insulation thickness of around 1 mm consists of two epoxy layers which enable the transfer of a part of the heat from the self-heating to the heat receiving thermistor. The temperature difference ΔT = T1 − T2 changes from around 2 °C to around 16 °C in the range of the ambient temperature Ta from 0 °C to 40 °C. The temperature difference ΔT is a function of the input supply voltage U as ΔT(U) = T1(U) − T2(U), and using Equations (3) and (4), it can be defined as in Equation (10):(10) ΔT=B1·T0/(B1+T0ln(U/I1R01))−B2·T0/(B2+T0ln(R2R02))

where the input resistance R1 = U/I1 and output resistance R2 are measured by a multimeter.

3.2. Heat Transfer in TCCT Device

The self-heating current I1(t) in Figure 7 is a current in a forced regime depending on the fixed supply voltage U. The heat generation and heat dissipation are in balance on the horizontal part of the bundle of curves I1(t). The delay time td ≈ 30 s from the switch on of the supply voltage U was estimated from the behavior I1(t) in the region below the knee of curves. As the horizontal curves I1(t) at Ta = 20 °C are not ideally horizontal, especially for higher values of U, the criterion of the stability of I1(t) in the horizontal region was introduced as k = I1(t = 40)/I1(t = 80) > 0.97 to limit the voltage U and heat generation. Using the same criterion k > 0.97 of stability for other ambient temperatures Ta in the ambient temperature range from 0 °C to 40 °C, the bar diagram in Figure 7 was formed with limited values of the supply voltage U and self-heating current I1. The aim was to limit the input power P1 in accordance with the criterion of k > 0.97. The behavior of the resistances R1 and R2 and temperatures T1 and T2 in the TCCT device vs. time given in Figure 8 show that the self-heating cycle (U = 8 V) and cooling cycle (U = 0 V) differ in shape; the self-heating cycle is a forced regime caused by the supply voltage U, and the cooling cycle is a natural process of heat dissipation. The initial heating and cooling time to the heating/cooling balance is a delay time td ≈ 30 s from the switch on of the supply voltage U.

The heat balance equation in the local equilibrium is given by (11):(11) q1=q2+q3+q4

The heat generation in the self-heating thermistor Th1 is a product of electrical power U·I1 and time Δt, as given by Equation (12):(12) q1=U·I1·Δt

The heat transfer from the Th1 to Th2 chip thermistor through a thin epoxy layer interface di ≈ 1 mm, surface value A, and thermal conductivity Ke is given by Equation (13):(13) q2=−Ke·A·[(T2−T1)/di]·Δt

Hence, the sum of the heat loss q3 on the boundary of the thermistor Th1/epoxy/air corresponding to T1 − Ta and q4 on the boundary of the thermistor Th2/epoxy/air corresponding to T2 − Ta is given by Equation (14). (14) q3+q4=U·I1·Δt+Ke·A·[(T2−T1)/d]·Δt

The dissipation surface for q3 and q4 is A3 = A4 = A0 − A, where A0 is the total outlook surface of the chip thermistor, T1 and T2 are the thermistor temperatures, respectively, the epoxy coating thickness of the chip is d3 = d4 = 0.5 mm, and the heat dissipation length dain the surrounding air is unknown. Further, using an approximation of the temperatures on the epoxy coatings Te as Te1 ≈ T1 and Te2 ≈ T2 for the coated chip thermistors Th1 and Th2, respectively, q3 and q4 are given as (15) and (16):(15) q3=−Ka·A3·[(Ta−T1)/da]·Δt

(16) q4=−Ka·A4·[(Ta−T2)/da]·Δt

where Ka is the thermal conductivity of the air. Now, by replacing q3 and q4 in Equation (14), the heat balance equation is formed at room temperature Ta = 20 °C (17):(17) −Ka·A3·[(Ta−T1)/da]·Δt+−Ka·A4·[(Ta−T2)/da]·Δt=U·I1·Δt+Ke·A·[(T2−T1)/d]·Δt

The unknown heat dissipation length da in the surrounding air is given by (18). (18) da={U·I1+Ke·A·[(T2−T1)/d]}/{−Ka·A3[2·Ta−T1−T2]}

Finally, adding the values for U, I1, Ka, Ke, T1, T2, Ta, di, A, and A3, the heat dissipation length da is derived as da ≈ 38.5 mm in the air at room temperature. The purpose could be that any other heat source within the vicinity of the TCCT (the “size” of this vicinity is defined by da) could affect the characteristic behavior of the TCCT and, therefore, this da value must at least be roughly estimated. The TCCT device has negligible thermal contact with the board; practically chip thermistors hang on the wires in the air.

The relative thermal coupling k1,2 between chip thermistors Th1 and Th2 can be defined using (19):(19) k1,2=[(T2−Ta)/(T1−Ta]

The thermal coupling k1,2 between the chip thermistors depends on the U, I1, and Ta; for example, at a room temperature of 20 °C, U = 8 V, I1 = 5.7 mA, its value is k1,2 ≈ 0.25. The obtained k1,2 value is smaller compared to the thermal coupling in thick film TF TCT and disk TCDT devices due to the fact that chip thermistors have a five times smaller nominal dissipation power.

3.3. Comparison of TCCT with TF TCT and TCDT Devices

The properties of the TCCT device were compared in Table 1 with the thick film (TF) TCT device and disk TCDT properties which were published recently in [30,31].

The TCCT is a cubic device and has around 30 times lower volume compared to the TCDT device and around 100 times compared to the thick film TF TCT. The power of TCCT device is 5 times lower and relative thermal coupling k1,2 is 1.5 to 2 times lower compared to TF TCT and TCDT devices. This result is a consequence of the heat transfer from the self-heating to passive chip thermistor through the small interface surface and the device body. The surface on the board of the TCCT is around 30 to 100 times smaller and the heat transfer path is only 1 mm. This result of k1,2 is a consequence of high alumina thermal conductivity, which is much higher than the thermal conductivity of the epoxy insulation layer between the Th1 and Th2 thermistors. The TCCT device sensitivity can be defined as Δ1 = ΔT2/ΔU (from Figure 6) using limitations for U (in Figure 7) and Δ2 = ΔP1/ΔT2 (from Figure 10). In brief, the reason for this is the output to input feedback and practical use of the TCCT for the control of the input power P1 by the output temperature T2. The comparison of the TF TCT, disk TCT, and TCCT devices’ sensitivity for the ambient temperature Ta in the range of around 1 °C to 40 °C is given in Table 2.

The inaccuracy ΔB of the exponential factor B according to Equation (2) given above in Section 2.1 is dependent on the inaccuracies in the measuring of resistances R and temperature T in the climatic test chamber. The inaccuracy ΔB is now determined by Equation (20):ΔB = 2·ΔR/R + 2·ΔT/T(20)

The inaccuracy ΔB measured in the climatic test chamber does not exceed 0.3%.

The temperature inaccuracy ΔT according to Equation (3) depends on resistance R and ΔB from the previous equation. It is defined as in (4):ΔT = 2·ΔR/R + ΔB/B(21)

The temperature inaccuracy ΔT does not exceed 0.5%.

The inaccuracy in the measurement of the self-heating electrical current I1 is dependent on the measuring of the input voltage U, ambient temperature Ta, and time t as I1(U, Ta, t). The self-heating current has an inaccuracy of Δsc given by the next Equation (22):Δsc = ΔI/I + ΔU/U + Δt/t(22)

It does not exceed 0.3%. The inaccuracy of the measuring system ΔMS (only digital instruments in Figure 2) depends on the measuring of U, I, R, and the power source Ups, as given in (23):ΔMS = ΔU/U + ΔI/I + ΔR/R + ΔU/UPS(23)

The inaccuracy of the full measuring system ΔMS does not exceed 0.4%. After a year of testing, there was no change in the thermistor nominal resistances R01 and R02 and the exponential factor B.

4. Conclusions

In this work, the electrical and thermal properties of the chip thermistor TCCT device (thermally coupled chip thermistors) were measured and analyzed and after that, compared with the previous thick film (TF) TCT device and disk TCDT device (the main properties are given in Table 1 and Table 2). The main advantages are summarized and grouped as follows.

The main properties: The chip TCCT is a resistive device based on the thermal junction of two small NTC chip thermistors: a chip size of 0603 and dissipation power of 100 mW, nominal resistance R0 ≈ 2600 Ω, and exponential factor B = 3908 K. The input voltage U was limited using a practical criterion k > 0.97 (Section 2.2, bar diagrams in Figure 7) to keep the stability of the self-heating current according to the ambient temperature Ta in the range from around 1 °C to 40 °C. Practically, the self-heating current is limited to a maximum of 10 mA and power to a maximum of 25 mW. The various chip thermistors’ nominal resistances can be chosen to form the TCCT with a resistances’ ratio Rinput/Routput from 1:1 to 1:5 or more. The input supply voltage can be DC, AC, or slow changeable impulses, and the output chip thermistor has a thermal response with a thermally coupling factor k1,2 ≈ 0.25. The insulation resistance of the epoxy between the chip thermistors was >109 Ω, and the delay time of the chip thermistor response from the switch on of the supply voltage U to a stable self-heating current I1 was less than 30 s.

The main advantages: The chip TCCT is a small cubic type of device made out of modified nickel manganese chip thermistors (NTC). The thermal coupling (heat transfer) from the self-heating thermistor to heat receiving thermistor is weaker (k1,2 ≈ 0.25) compared to the TF TCT and disk TCDT devices (realized recently in our previous works), but the volume and occupied area on a PCB are much smaller. The production of TCCT is cheaper. The TCCT device operates like an electro-thermal potentiometer (slider-less).

The core conclusions are the following: The chip TCCT device has a small volume and simple construction, is cheap to use, and enables different applications, such as the measurement of the input power through the output temperature.
