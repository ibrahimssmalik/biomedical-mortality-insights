Background

Neurodevelopment assessment tools for low-resource settings are urgently needed. However, most available tools were developed in high-income settings and may lack cross-cultural validity.

Methods

We piloted and adapted two subtests within the planning domain of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-2nd edition (KABC-II) for use in rural Zimbabwean children aged 7years. After initial assessments of face validity, we created 4 substitutions for the story completion subtest and 7 additions for the pattern reasoning subtest through a co-design process with fieldworkers and child development experts. To assess how successful the changes were, T-tests adjusting for unequal variances were used to compare scores between the original and adapted versions of the same subtest. ANOVA and pairwise analysis was performed to compare the performance of KABC-II subtests across domains. Intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated to explore the variability between domains.

Results

Initial test scores on the planning domain were significantly lower than the other three domains of learning, sequential memory and simultaneous reasoning (P<0.001) in 50 children (mean age 7.6(SD 0.2) years). Modified subtests were administered to another 20 children (mean age 7.6(SD 0.2) years), who showed story completion scores that were 0.7 marks higher (95% CI 0.0, 1.4; P=0.05) and pattern reasoning scores 1.8 marks higher (95% CI 0.5, 3.2; P=0.01). Overall, the planning domain mean score increased from 8.1 (SD 2.9) to 10.6 (SD 3.4). The intra class correlation coefficient between all four KABC-II domains was initially 0.43 (95% CI 0.13, 0.64) and after modification was 0.69 (95% CI 0.37, 0.87), suggesting an increase in the construct validity.

Conclusions

The KABC-II planning domain was successfully adapted to improve cross-cultural validity. Construct validity was enhanced, based on increased inter-correlations among scales. The process of co-design to modify tests for new settings may be beneficial for other commonly used neurodevelopmental tools.

Over 250 million children worldwide are at risk of poor cognitive development 1 . Neurodevelopmental assessment requires tools that are adaptable to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) settings. While some locally developed tools are available 2 , many widely used tools have been developed and validated in high-resource settings, including Wechsler’s Intelligence Scales 3 , the Bayley Scales for Infant and Toddler Development 4 and the second edition of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-II) 5 . These tools incorporate tests and questions that are relevant to the settings where they were developed and validated but may require a lengthy adaptation process for cross-cultural use.

One of the advantages of KABC-II is that it has a dual theoretical framework, with up to 18 individual tests (called subtests) that use either the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) psychometric model or Luria’s cognitive processing model. Luria’s approach is often used in LMICs because it measures cognitive processing by focusing on novel tests and puzzles not generally seen in schools, removing subtests that rely on acquired knowledge. This helps to correct for variable school enrolment and exposure. The KABC-II can be condensed to eight subtests and the raw subtest scores are then scaled, based on the participant’s age. The scaled results of two subtests are added together to each of the four Luria domains of cognitive processing as follows ( Figure 1) 6 : Number Recall and Word Order subtests give the Sequential memory domain; Story Completion and Pattern Reasoning subtests provide the Planning domain; Atlantis and Atlantis Delayed subtests constitute the Learning domain; and Rover and Triangles subtests provide the Simultaneous logic domain. The subtest scaled scores can also be combined to provide the mental processing index (MPI) as an overall measure of cognitive function 6 .

The KABC-II was originally developed and validated using a large sample of children in the USA 5 . It has since been widely used across Africa 7 , demonstrating robust factor analysis in Uganda 8 and psychometric validity and reliability in rural South Africa 6, 9 . Recently, improved KABC-II monitoring and quality assurance has been demonstrated using regular video review 10 across multiple countries and languages in Africa, including with a Shona translation in Zimbabwe 10, 11 . Using KABC-II, a significant effect on cognition was detected following a nutrition intervention in South African children aged 6–11 years old on two of the subtests 12 , whilst in Ethiopia, 5-year-old children with poorer growth had worse KABC-II scores than those with good growth 13 . In Burkina Faso, five of the KABC-II subtests identified poorer scores in children with stunting 14 . However, these studies 12– 14 did not include the Story Completion subtest and so did not calculate a mental processing index (MPI). For studies that did calculate a MPI using the Luria model 10, 11 the planning domain did score lower than other domains, but no major concerns with validity were noted by the authors. To optimally measure cognitive processing, a certain level of baseline understanding of the subtest and individual items should be achieved. Although it has been widely used across sub-Saharan Africa, there has been little documented pre-testing and piloting exploring cross-cultural validity within these individual subtests. Here we report two separate methods for piloting the adaptation of KABC-II cognitive subtests following concerns raised in their face validity during its use in rural Zimbabwe. The adaptations from this pilot study will then be applied for measuring school-aged children in rural Zimbabwe who were previously in The Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) cluster randomised study 15 .

Methods

Participants: Study site and data collection

A pilot study to assess school-age children’s growth, physical and cognitive development was conducted in Zvamabande (rural) and Makusha (peri-urban) regions of Shurugwi district in Midlands Province, Zimbabwe between 3 rd September 2020 and 3 rd December 2020 16 . Inclusion criteria were children aged 7 years old who were resident in either of these two regions, identified by the Community healthworkers (CHWs) and with a primary caregiver available who was able to consent. The site for this pilot study included where the SHINE cluster randomised trial was previously conducted, so any children who were born into the SHINE trial were excluded. From the children initially identified by CHWs, 80 children (mean age 7.6 years, SD 0.2) were randomly selected by computer in Harare, thus minimising selection bias (80 was a convenient sample size to achieve during the three months of piloting, and enabled the team to test a variety of other measures of cognitive and physical function in the pilot study detailed elsewhere 16 ). After community sensitisation, a specific sensitisation visit to the family was conducted by the CHWs using a community sensitisation sheet in Shona or Ndebele (the local languages). If the family expressed an interest in participating, a mutually convenient date was arranged. Caregivers then gave written informed consent (including the right to withdraw at any time) and children gave written assent for participation. Ethical approval for the pilot study was obtained from the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe on 6 th April 2020 (MRCZ/A/1675). There was an amendment for this pilot study that was approved on 31 st July 2020. There were no recorded harms from this study. The main SHINE follow-up study was approved by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe (MRCZ), approval number MRCZ/A/1675 on 8 th February 2021. Measurements and analyses for this main follow-up study are ongoing and due to finish in 2023. Further details of the SHINE Follow-up study are available as a preprint 17 and on Open Science Framework.

Cognitive tests comprised the KABC-II, a school achievement test measuring literacy and numeracy, a finger-tapping task to measure fine motor skills, the caregiver-reported Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, and a child socioemotional score, as previously described 16 . The KABC-II was selected as part of the test battery because previous factor analysis had shown it was applicable in a similar setting in rural South Africa 6 . KABC-II assessments were undertaken at the household (can be found as Supplementary Figure 1 in Underlying data 18 ). The KABC-II measurements were administered in a tent pitched close to the household, where the caregiver and child could see each other at all times.

The KABC-II

The KABC-II measures the processing and cognitive abilities of children aged 3–18 years old. It is directly administered to one child at a time and the answers are recorded by an individual fieldworker, who has undergone extensive training, typically by a psychologist. Each subtest starts with a standardised explanation to introduce the concepts required and then sample and training questions follow. This provides the child with a standardised training for each subtest. Starting points for several subtests are based on the child’s age, with the option of dropping back to earlier starting points if an older child gets initial questions wrong. Later questions then increase in difficulty and the child stops after a discontinue rule is met, usually after getting a certain number of sequential questions wrong. Responses are recorded on a custom answer sheet to provide raw totals for each subtest, which are converted to scaled scores based on the child’s age, with younger children scoring comparatively higher for the same raw total. The eight subtests take approximately two hours to administer (including breaks).

Online training for the KABC-II with feedback was provided from expert trainers via zoom in Uganda, Malawi and South Africa, combined with local training within Zimbabwe in Shona. The KABC-II was administered by fieldworkers who were trained primary care nurses. They were monitored by the study paediatrician (JP) and project lead (CM). A standardisation exercise was performed during this pilot study which showed good inter-rate reliability, where each primary care nurse measured one child using the KABC-II and the other three marked independently.

KABC-II adaptation

After the first 50 children were assessed, we noted that children were scoring relatively poorly on the planning domain of the KABC-II due to low scores in both story completion and pattern reasoning subtests. This observation had previously been noted in rural South Africa 6 . We therefore decided to adapt these two subtests using a stepwise process, based on initial concerns regarding face validity, and then subsequent monitoring as cognitive measurement continued ( Figure 1). This monitoring included noting the children’s explanation of answers, and then analysing the proportion of correct answers for each individual question (individual question analysis, IQA) in both subtests for the first 50 children. This identified certain questions where unfamiliarity with the question or concept was causing poor performance. From these initial concerns of face validity noted by the data collection team, alternative and additional items were designed by those researchers based in Zimbabwe (JP, CM, GM, IM, TM, MM, DC and NVT). A diverse board of international experts were then consulted (MG, TF, AK and NK) including the original developers of the KABC-II (AK, NK). Therefore, for story completion, alternative items were developed, pre-tested and then ranked in order of difficulty before substituting problematic questions ( Figure 1). For pattern reasoning, additional items were developed, pre-tested and then ranked in order of difficulty before being included ( Figure 1). After these subtests were modified, custom scoring sheets for the raw scores were also developed, but the scaling of scores based on age was unchanged. The performance of the remaining 20 children on the modified subtests was evaluated using IQA to determine the effect of the modifications on the subtests. Permission for adaptation and translation was obtained from Pearson. We hypothesized that (a) scores would increase significantly on the two modified planning subtests, thereby providing evidence that the changes made to enhance cultural fairness were successful; and (b) correlations between domains of the KABC-II would increase after the modifications, suggesting an improvement in construct validity of the adapted test.

Data analysis

Mean scores of the subtests for the 50 children before modification were compared to 20 children who performed the adapted subtests by using independent sample T-tests with unequal variance. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed for the first 50 children to determine if the difference amongst domains was significant, with a post-hoc Tukey’s test to describe the pairwise differences between individual domains. This was similarly performed for the last 20 children. Finally, the intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement using a two-way mixed effects model was calculated between domains before and after modification. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel (RRID:SCR_016137), IBM SPSS Statistics v27 (RRID:SCR_016479) and Stata v15.0 (RRID:SCR_012763). An alternative freely available software that could perform this analysis would be R-project.

Results

A total of 157 eligible children aged 7 years old were identified by CHWs, from whom 80 were randomly selected remotely by the study statistician. Among these 80 children, two families declined to be measured and three children had the wrong age on documentation, therefore five random replacements were made. Overall, 80 children (39 girls; 49%) were enrolled and underwent assessments between September 3 rd and December 4 th, 2020. This was part of a broader pilot study examining growth, physical and cognitive function, which is detailed elsewhere 16 , including baseline characteristics. Data from 10 of the 80 child assessments were used for standardisation between fieldworkers and were therefore excluded from the KABC-II adaptation process. These 10 children were all chosen during one week of standardisation measurements. Results from 70 children (35 girls; 50%) were used in the analysis of the modifications. All children successfully performed the tasks with standard instructions as recommended by the KABC-II protocol.

Results 18 from the first 50 children showed that scores were significantly lower in the planning domain (mean score 8.1 (SD 2.9)), compared to the other domains (sequential 12.6 (SD 2.8), learning 13.5 (SD 3.1), simultaneous 11.6 (SD 3.5); P<0.001) ( Figure 2). A post-hoc Tukey’s test revealed that marks were significantly lower for planning compared to learning with a mean difference of 5.4 marks, (95% CI 3.8, 7.0; P<0.001), simultaneous (3.5 marks; 95% CI 1.9, 5.1; P<0.001) and sequential domains (4.6 marks; 95% CI 3.0, 6.2; P<0.001). Comparing between the other domains, the simultaneous score was less compared to learning (1.9; 95% CI 0.3, 3.5; P=0.01) but there were no other significant differences for sequential compared to learning (0.9; 95% CI -0.7, 2.5; P=0.5) or sequential compared to simultaneous (1.0; 95% CI -0.6, 2.6; P=0.34).

Figure 2. Scores for the first 50 children showed reduced scoring in the Planning domain, comprised of Story Completion and Pattern Reasoning subtests.

KABC-II, Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-2 nd edition.

The planning domain comprises two subtests: first, a story completion task, in which children have to pick the missing picture(s) from a selection of pictures, and then align them in the correct sequence to complete a picture-based story; and second, a pattern reasoning task, in which children have to select the correct printed shape or image to fit within a repeating pattern (can be found as Supplementary Figure 2–Figure 3 in Underlying data 18 )

Story completion

The story completion task contains 18 questions, although this rural Zimbabwean population of 7-year-olds did not progress past item 12. There is one sample question and three training questions, with a discontinue rule once children answer three sequential questions incorrectly. Individual question analysis identified challenges with problematic items, which were observed to be 4, 6, 8 and 9 ( Figure 3a) (see extended data and results for further explanation). When asked to explain their choices, it was apparent that children did not sufficiently understand the picture stories on these items to be able to complete them logically or consistently. For example, for item 4, the picture story was of a birthday cake with candles being lit, blown out and then shared. In a rural Zimbabwean context, children did not recognise the small candles on the cake and thought they were flowers, or realised that there was fire on the cake, but did not realise it was arising from birthday candles. They did not understand the sequence to blow the candles out and also did not pick consistent alternatives.

( b) Adaptation of story completion showing substitutions and rearrangement of items in order of increasing difficulty. ( c) Normalised histogram of total scores for original and modified story completion.

Alternative picture stories to replace the problematic items 4, 6, 8 and 9 of the story completion subtest were designed based on more familiar and locally relevant stories ( e.g., washing, cooking or riding a bicycle) that could be easily described in pictures. A sequence of photographs was taken locally for each of the picture-based stories to provide an appropriate Zimbabwean context. These pictures were designed to match a story sequence that was similar to the KABC-II item they were replacing. They were then printed and pre-tested in a small group of eight children (can be found as Supplementary Figure 2 in Underlying data 18 ). However, with feedback from pretesting, the alternative stories varied in difficulty in a different way from the original sequence. For example, the new picture story of falling off a bicycle appeared easier to complete (can be found as Supplementary Figure 2 in Underlying data 18 ), although it was designed to replace item 9 (a picture story of a tightrope walker). We therefore re-arranged the sequence of questions so that the picture stories were administered in order of increasing difficulty, defined as the proportion of children who got them correct ( Figure 3b). The proportion correct on each story completion item was calculated, both for the original story completion questions and the alternative story completion questions. Among the 20 children assessed using the modified story completion, their mean score was significantly higher (mean 4.8; 95% CI 4.2, 5.4) than among the initial 50 children assessed using only the original story completion task (mean 4.1; 95% CI 3.8, 4.4); mean difference 0.7 (95% CI 0.0, 1.4; P=0.05; Figure 3c).

Pattern reasoning

Individual question analysis on the pattern reasoning subtest showed that few children were getting correct answers after item 4 ( Figure 4a). Although questions after item 4 had reasonable face validity, it seemed they were not being answered with sufficient understanding to accurately represent the child’s problem solving ability. Discussion with community members and primary school teachers highlighted that these children had not previously seen puzzles with alternating patterns. The KABC-II only has a single training question that demonstrates alternating patterns (item 2). It became apparent this was insufficient for children to grasp the concept consistently before answering further questions, and that they needed more examples. Therefore instead of any substitutions, additional pattern reasoning items were developed to supplement the original items. It was decided that all these additional items would be training questions, so that the child would receive feedback to explain what the correct answer was if they got the item wrong. A total of 12 additional questions using alternating patterns were developed and then pre-tested. From these 12, the 7 most appropriate questions were chosen for inclusion as items in the final test battery, based on face validity and feedback from the pre-testing (all supplemental items included can be found as Supplementary Figure 3 in Underlying data 18 ). The selected pattern questions included shapes as well as contextually appropriate pictures of goats and chickens (can be found as Supplementary Figure 3 in Underlying data 18 ). Each item had a training point about learning individual colours, orientation or number of objects within the pattern. All seven additional pattern questions were included as training questions for every child: Therefore they were included in the scoring, with explanations given if the child got the question wrong. We termed this modified pattern reasoning “Pattern Plus” because it provided additional exposure to alternating patterns prior to the remainder of the pattern reasoning subtest. As these were additional questions, all of the original KABC-II pattern reasoning questions were included with no substitutions made. We developed routine explanations for the Pattern Plus questions to standardise the training given to the child.

( b) Normalised histogram of total scores for original and modified pattern reasoning, including the scoring from the Pattern Plus training questions. KABC-II, Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-2 nd edition.

For the 20 children who had these additional training questions for pattern reasoning, we first examined whether their scores had improved for the original KABC-II questions only ( Figure 4a). Their scores (mean 4.6 marks; 95% CI 3.6, 5.5) were not significantly higher than among the 50 children assessed using the original pattern completion task without Pattern Plus training (4.0 marks; 95% CI 3.3, 4.6); mean difference 0.6 (95% CI -0.5, 1.7; P=0.3, Figure 4a). However, when the scoring from the Pattern Plus training questions was also included, the mean score significantly increased to 5.8 (95% CI 4.6, 7.0); mean difference compared to original test 1.8 (95% CI 0.5, 3.2; P=0.01) ( Figure 4b).

Total scores in the planning domain among the 20 children who performed the modified story completion and pattern reasoning subtests showed a significant improvement compared to the 50 children assessed using the original KABC-II tests (mean score 10.6 (95% CI 9.0, 12.2) versus 8.1 (95% CI 7.2, 8.9; P=0.01), respectively; mean difference 2.5 (95% CI 0.8, 4.3; P=0.01) ( Figure 5).

Figure 5. Scores for the last 20 children showed improvement in the Planning domain after modifications to the Story Completion and Pattern Reasoning subtests.

KABC-II, Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-2 nd edition.

When comparing domains for the last 20 children, scores still remained lower in the modified planning domain (mean score 10.6 (SD 3.4)), compared to the other domains (learning 14.3 (SD 4.0), simultaneous 12.7 (SD 3.8), sequential 13.2 (SD 3.7); P=0.001). However, a post-hoc Tukey’s test revealed that marks were significantly lower only for planning compared to learning (mean difference 3.7 marks; 95% CI 0.7, 6.8), but not for simultaneous (2.1 marks; 95% CI -0.5, 5.2) or sequential scales (2.6 marks; 95% CI -0.5, 5.7). Comparisons between the other domains showed no other significant differences for these 20 children. The intraclass correlation coefficient between domains for the first 50 children using the unmodified planning domain was 0.43 (95% CI 0.13, 0.64). For the last 20 children using the modified planning domain it was 0.69 (95% CI 0.37, 0.87).

Discussion

There is a recognised need for context-specific tools to measure neurodevelopment in LMIC settings 19, 20 . Many existing proprietary tools were developed in high-income settings and may not be immediately transferable to an LMIC context. We used the KABC-II to evaluate school-age cognition in rural Zimbabwe and successfully adapted two subtests using complementary methods: substitution, addition and rearrangement of items for the story completion task, and addition of further training questions for the pattern reasoning task. Both adaptations increased the scores that children achieved on these subtests, improving their overall performance in the planning domain, which was previously noted to be reduced compared to other domains in rural South Africa 9 .

As previously mentioned, results from the first 50 children showed that scores were significantly lower in the planning domain (mean score 8.1 (SD 2.9)), compared to others (sequential 12.6 (SD 2.8), learning 13.5 (SD 3.1), simultaneous 11.6 (SD 3.5); P<0.001). After modification, the planning domain mean (SD) of 10.6 (3.4) increased but was still lower compared to the others (learning 14.3 (4.0), simultaneous 12.7 (3.8) and sequential 13.2 (3.7); P=0.001). However, individual marks for subtests or domains were not always reported by other studies 12– 14 . For the study in rural South Africa in 376 children aged 9–12 years 9 comparable mean (SD) domain scores of learning 14.5 (5.6), Sequential 17 (2.7), simultaneous 12.5 (2.8) and planning 10.1 (2.6); P<0.001) were measured. This study made a small change in story completion (item 9) so that the child could score the point if they washed the frying pan first as well as for the last card 9 but otherwise did not comment on any concerns with validity. The IMPAACT study 10 measured similar subtests and domains within the KABC-II and the planning domain appeared lowest in models adjusted for age and clinical site, although it was not possible to calculate the significance of the difference from the data available 10 . Again the authors did not raise any concerns of validity 10 . Therefore, there appears to be some consistency in the planning domain scoring lower, although these other studies did not report exploring the validity of story completion or pattern reasoning.

The planning domain is linked to executive function, so these adaptations may improve the predictive power of the KABC-II at age 7 years old and beyond. This is important because executive functions are higher level cognitive processes needed for self-control and decision-making. They are central to healthy behaviours and development in children and adolescents 21 . The development of executive function is highly sensitive to positive exposures such as high-quality education, and to negative exposures such as high adversity, poverty and lower-quality education 22 . Deficits in executive functions have been associated with a wide range of negative outcomes including behavioural and mental health problems. hars from this study.

To our knowledge, individual subtests within the KABC-II have not been previously examined and adapted in Africa. Many studies have used all subtests mentioned here across Africa 7 including Uganda 8 and rural South Africa 6, 9 , sometimes with video monitoring 10, 11 . An alternative approach has been to select individual subtests which do not provide an overall score such as the mental processing index, 12– 14 . For example in South Africa, difference in nutrition were observed to associate with the Rover and Atlantis subtests only 12 . In Ethiopia, certain subtests were selected based on the local context and combined differently, with the story completion subtest being excluded. Both mothers and children were assessed using number recall, word order and hand movement for short-term memory subtests. Visual processing assessment was assessed by combining triangles, pattern reasoning and conceptual thinking 13 . Scores between mothers and children were correlated and mother’s education was significantly correlated with pattern reasoning in particular. Scores on number recall, hand movements, triangles were reported higher in the non-stunted and normal-weight groups compared with the stunted or underweight groups. Conceptual thinking scores were reported lower in underweight children, and word order scores were lower in stunted children 13 . In Burkina Faso, stunted children were shown to perform significantly worse in memory (measured by atlantis and number recall subtests) and spatial abilities (triangles, conceptual thinking and face recognition subtests 14 but no overall measure of cognition divided into specific domains (such as is possible with the MPI) was made. It is possible that these studies may have had concerns of how culturally appropriate story completion was, but this was not documented.

The increase in mean scores for both subtests (15% increase in story completion, 30% increase in pattern reasoning) suggested they became more culturally appropriate. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between domains also increased with the adaptations, suggesting variability between domains may have reduced with the modifications. The increase in ICC suggests a potential improvement in construct validity of the planning domain, with higher intercorrelations between planning and the other domains. This is supported by the confidence intervals where the ICC before modification of 0.43 (95% CI 0.13, 0.64) excludes the ICC after modification of 0.69 (95% CI 0.37, 0.87). Note, however, that the pre-modification value of 0.43 is included in the post-modification confidence interval of 0.37 to 0.87; therefore, inferences about construct validity are tentative and require cross-validation.

The outcomes of this study show the value of careful monitoring and refinement of tools for use in new settings with different contexts from their original development. Adaptation is an important process in ensuring that neurodevelopmental tests are cross-culturally applicable. Other studies have previously shown improvements in test performance with culturally relevant adaptations, for example using wire to model patterns in Zambia instead of drawing 23 . Previously, nine different subtests from the KABC first edition (KABC) were adapted for use amongst 5–6 year olds in rural Kenya 24 . Alterations included translation, substitution of materials including more culturally relevant pictures, as well as altering the task structures to improve cross-cultural validity. It has been proposed that adaptation of individual tests should include monitoring the distribution of scores to identify floor and ceiling effects, undertaking test and re-test reliability to ensure stable measurement, ensuring high inter-rater agreement, and comparing internal consistency with similar measures 19 . Simultaneous measurement of contributing factors such as socioeconomic status may also demonstrate associations with variables that are expected to be related to the adapted tests (convergent validity). Repeated testing could also demonstrate increasing scores with age 19 . Another alternative is locally developed tools such as the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) 2 or Kilifi Development Inventory 25 , which can then establish culturally appropriate norms. However, using these in different contexts may also require similar processes of monitoring participants’ answers and subsequent adaptation.

This study has several strengths. The process of checking face validity of items and then monitoring individual responses to questions empowered fieldworkers and the local community to monitor children’s answers and suggest adaptations, leading to a more culturally inclusive tool through co-design. The IQA also provided a way to confirm or refute initial concerns regarding face validity: for example, in the story completion task, a story about cooking a fried egg was immediately flagged and eventually replaced because rural Zimbabwean households boil or scramble eggs but do not fry them (Item 8). Similarly, item 4 (blowing candles on a cake) was poorly understood as candles are rarely used in this setting to celebrate candles and replaced. Item 9 describing a high-wire artist falling in a circus had poor face validity because very few children had seen images of a circus or acrobats so this was replaced. The concept behind item 6 of building a model hut or ‘kitchen’, was well understood but the picture of the sticks scattered randomly was rarely picked correctly as the first picture. This was hypothesised that a building’s foundations and initial low walls are often first observed as in place early in construction in rural areas. The conceptual understanding was observed in most children and hence this item was included but moved to item 10 given its level of difficulty. IQA also highlighted that a series of pictures of a person blowing up balloons was well understood by children, even though the type of balloons were not commonly seen. Further details are available in extended data and results.

Although scores improved, they still remained lower than for other test domains, although after modification this difference was significant only when compared to the learning domain. It is plausible that children will continue to score lower in the planning domain despite adaptation, due to cultural factors such as reduced exposure to these types of puzzle 9 .

The study also has several limitations. Tukey’s pairwise comparison test between domains does include an adjustment for multiple testing, but the results of comparing multiple subtests should be interpreted with some caution due to the increased risk of chance errors. For our population of 7-year-old children, no child progressed beyond item 12 on the story completion task, so our adaptation did not modify later items. Therefore, for studies using the KABC-II in older children in rural sub-Saharan Africa, we would recommend a similar monitoring phase for later items of story completion to highlight any problematic questions and then undertake pretesting of any alterations. The number of children trying each new story completion item varied, as these items became available at different timepoints. The use of photographs in story completion as an alternative to illustration may have changed some cognitive processing of the task, so ideally imaging software should be used to convert these items to illustrations. The order of the Pattern Plus sequence was decided based on increasingly complex alternating patterns, partly informed by the observation that patterns with pictures appeared more challenging than shapes. All Pattern Plus questions were asked as training questions to all the 20 children with explanations given. For young children, the addition of seven pattern plus questions may be too many, and so similar adaptations may use fewer and simpler patterns. For older children, it is hoped the concept of alternating patterns with seven examples was sufficient, but this would need to be verified. The process of developing, printing and pre-testing alternative or additional items took time so that more children were tested before the adaptations (n=50) compared to after (n=20). Finally, test re-test reliability was not measured because it was not possible to revisit the children due to the rural locations of the measurement, although this step is recommended to demonstrate test stability 19 .

The adaptations in the KABC-II performed in children within this pilot study were made in preparation for following up the SHINE trial: The SHINE trial was a 2×2 factorial trial in rural Zimbabwe that was ethically approved by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe (MRCZ/A/1675) and registered in 2013 (NCT01824940). This trial randomized children to lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) and/or a comprehensive household water, sanitation and hygiene WASH intervention 26– 29 . Mothers were enrolled in early pregnancy, with detailed data collection on home, maternal, birth and early-life factors. The adaptations from this pilot study detailed here are being applied to children born into the SHINE trial who are aged 7 years old. The SHINE follow-up study (PACTR number PACTR202201828512110) aims to measure approximately 1,300 children. Further details including the SHINE follow-up CRF’s and protocol are also available at Open Science Framework. Further analysis of the SHINE follow-up dataset may include monitoring for floor and ceiling effects within these KABC-II adaptations, checking inter-rater agreement and comparing internal consistency with similar measurements. Convergent validity demonstrating expected associations with socioeconomic status and caregiver education may also be explored as future steps.

In conclusion, two subtests of the KABC-II were successfully adapted for use in rural Zimbabwe, drawing on both local and international expertise. This helped to increase scoring on the planning domain of cognitive processing, so that performance became more comparable to other domains in the KABC-II. The process of reviewing the face validity of items, together with monitoring of children’s responses both qualitatively and by individual question analysis helped to identify items for support. Substitution, rearrangement and addition of items can improve cross-cultural validity of cognition tools, working in collaboration with the original developers, local community and participants.

Katherine Brown, from the Centre for Outcomes in Children's Critical Illness and Cardiovascular Disease, University College London. 

'Piloting the adaptation of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children—2 nd edition (KABC-II) to assess school-age neurodevelopment in rural Zimbabwe'  is an important, carefully planned and executed piece of work. The authors are addressing an important issue, which is that access to suitable valid and culturally appropriate measures to assess child development is not always as good as it should be. Although many measures for the assessment of child development exist, they are dominated by tools developed in high income settings, often also measures that require a very high level of training and sometimes special equipment in order for them to be used. Studies of this type are challenging to undertake and the authors have sought to carefully address an important gap within their study which has led to adaptations of the KABC-2.

Comments and suggestions:

Please make it clearer in the introduction whether the referenced studies 12-14 identified similar problems with the same subscales (story completion and pattern reasoning)?: these statements in introduction are not specific enough. 

The references to the Shine study in the introduction and methods are a bit confusing. For example, in the methods the authors state that participants in Shine were excluded, but then go on to refer to the Shine follow study when discussing ethical approvals. Please clarify the relationship between this study and Shine?

In methods, please provide a bit more detail on who undertook the assessments, their training and any additional validation or additional person review of tester activities that were undertaken. For clarity, it might be helpful to use a specific section of text on the measure and a separate section on the administration of the measure. 

In the results section, please provide a bit more specific detail about the items that were problematic in the story completion section and pattern reasoning, which item numbers and a complete list is needed. 

The pattern reasoning section is harder to follow than the story completion section even with reference to the supplementary materials. The rationale / reason for the substitutions is to use contextually appropriate goats and chickens, can the authors be clearer were all replaced or some, and how was this selection made? In supplementary materials pattern reasoning account, I was not able to determine exactly which patterns were original versus added. I did not find accompanying supplementary text detailing the exact reasons / issues / rationale related to the pattern reasoning section (whereas this is presented more clearly with better signposting for the story completion section again in supp materials). 

In discussion please could the authors expand on what if any further validation work is needed for the adapted measure. It is not uncommon for test retest to be infeasible for a this type of study in a high income setting. At the same time concurrent validity / construct validity of the adapted measure could be assessed in a future study?

Reviewer Comment:

The rationale / reason for the substitutions is to use contextually appropriate goats and chickens, can the authors be clearer were all replaced or some, and how was this selection made?

I did not find accompanying supplementary text detailing the exact reasons / issues / rationale related to the pattern reasoning section (whereas this is presented more clearly with better signposting for the story completion section again in supp materials). 

Author Response:

We apologise for the confusion. We have tried to clarify that for pattern reasoning, only further additions were made and no substitutions occurred. All of the patterns in supplementary materials were added. For copyright purposes, we have not included any of the original patterns. We have added further explanation for pattern reasoning.

Reviewer Comment:

Author Response:

Thank you for this point. This had been stated in limitations, but is now made clearer with plans for further verification within the SHINE follow-up dataset.

Version 1recommendationapprove-with-reservations
Having reviewed “Piloting the adaptation of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children—2nd edition (KABC-II) to assess school-age neurodevelopment in rural Zimbabwe”, I have found it to be an extremely interesting adaptation of the KABC-II. It is a detailed study describing the adaptation of the test, the data-driven rationale for choosing which items to adapt and piloting the adapted version on children has shown how their adaptations have improved the scale. Overall I have found this to be a well-written article. My comments are listed below –

Abstract: In methods sentence 1, consider moving “ both within the planning domain” to the beginning of the sentence instead of the end, i.e. after “ We piloted and adapted two subtests (pattern reasoning and story completion)”. It will make for a less interrupted read.

Can the number of items substituted and added into each subsets of the test be mentioned somewhere in the abstract since this is one of the main results of the paper i.e. what all had to be done to the battery to make it appropriate for their settings. This could be in abstract methods or even in results.

Include age range or mean (sd) of the children in the methods

I would move the numbers of children for both phases of the pilot into the methods instead of the results in abstract

Introduction: Expansion of LMIC is missing the word “countries”

Within the literature citing KABC-II use in Africa, it is unclear what subtests have worked and what haven’t in these studies in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and South Africa. Are they also the planning domain? While I understand that adaptation and piloting for these settings have not been systematically described, could these studies be brought back into the discussion to compare how these findings compare to how KABC-II use has been described in other African settings?

Methods: As in abstract, I suggest you mention either age range of participants of the mean and sd

The SHINE study appears abruptly in the methods in the sentence “Any children who were born into the SHINE cluster randomised trial were excluded.” I suggest adding in the previous sentence that the site was the same one as that in which the SHINE study was conducted.

In the sentence “ After community sensitisation, a specific sensitisation visit to the family was conducted by the CHWs using a community sensitisation sheet in Shona or Ndebele (the local languages).” The word “was” is missing

The actual process of creating the modified items for either story completion or pattern reasoning is not detailed. The word “co-design” is mentioned in some places in the manuscript but it is not clear in methods how the individual items were identified, who vetted their face validity, was Pearson involved in this process at all? Was there a committee of experts established who reviewed these items? Details of this process will enable its replication for this or indeed other developmental assessment tools in other studies

Results: The score on the KABC-II domains before adaptation are reported in the first section. Could these be brought back into the discussion to compare them against other African studies which might have been conducted on children of similar ages?

Story completion section – specific items identified to be challenging mentioned here aren’t clearly different from other higher difficulty items in the graph e.g. 7, 10, 11, 12. I think the explanation is there in supplementary methods, can that please be referenced at this point so the reader knows that there is more rationale given by the authors albeit buried in supplementary data

Story completion section – Could the discussion comment on “why” some items of the story completion task might not have been recognizable by the children? This would help highlight the socio-cultural reasons for which the adaptation needed to be done

Story completion section – In the sentence “ A sequence of photographs was taken for each of the picture-based stories.” Please clarify that these were locally taken i.e. were African in context

Story completion section – In the text, please clarify where figures 3b and 3c have been referenced and not only call them figure 3.

Pattern reasoning section – in the sentence “ Their scores (mean 4.6 marks; 95% CI 3.6, 5.5) were not significantly higher than among the 50 children assessed using the original pattern completion task without training (4.0 marks; 95% CI 3.3, 4.6); mean difference 0.6 (95% CI -0.5, 1.7; P=0.3, Figure 4a).” mention that this training was Pattern Plus Training as is mentioned in the legend of Figure 4

Discussion: Please note a few suggestions for improvement within the relevant sections above

The sentence “ There were no recorded harms from this study.” Appears out of the blue. Could it be moved to methods where the ethics are being described?

In the section with the sentence “ For young children, the addition of seven pattern plus questions may be too many, and so similar adaptations may use fewer and simpler patterns.” Could a similar comment be made on how these adaptations may or may not be sufficient for older children as well given the age range of KABC-II is 3-18 years?

In the sentence “ Finally, test re-test reliability was not measured because it was not possible to revisit the children due to the rural locations of the measurement, although this step is recommended to demonstrate test stability18.” The authors rightly comment on how not all forms of validation of the tool have been possible. I feel this needs to be expanded to include that other validations have also not been done yet, of the types that the authors themselves have mentioned in the paragraph before strengths i.e. “ It has been proposed that adaptation of individual tests should include monitoring the distribution of scores to identify floor and ceiling effects, undertaking test and re-test reliability to ensure stable measurement, ensuring high inter-rater agreement, and comparing internal consistency with similar measures18. Simultaneous measurement of contributing factors such as socioeconomic status may also demonstrate associations with variables that are expected to be related to the adapted tests (convergent validity). Repeated testing could also demonstrate increasing scores with age18. Another alternative is locally developed tools such as the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT)2 or Kilifi Development Inventory24, which can then establish culturally appropriate norms. However, using these in different contexts may also require similar processes of monitoring participants’ answers and subsequent adaptation.” – I imagine some of these will emerge from the SHINE follow up study and this can be mentioned as next steps of this work

Figure 1: Please include sample sizes in the flowchart at “ cognitive measurement started”, “ pre-testing” and I imagine another box would need to be added for the N=20. I feel this would make the methods flowchart more comprehensive

Figure 2 & 5: I wonder if it is possible to show the planning domain data as a histogram for the two conditions of before and after adaptations. It would be useful to be able to compare the results directly without looking at 2 separate figures. Plotting percentage of participants on the y axis would allow for comparison despite the different sample size.

Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

Yes

If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?

Yes

Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?

Yes

Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?

Yes

Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?

Another alternative is locally developed tools such as the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT)2 or Kilifi Development Inventory24, which can then establish culturally appropriate norms. However, using these in different contexts may also require similar processes of monitoring participants’ answers and subsequent adaptation.” – I imagine some of these will emerge from the SHINE follow up study and this can be mentioned as next steps of this work

Author Response: Thank you this has been included.

Reviewer Comment:

Figure 1: Please include sample sizes in the flowchart at “ cognitive measurement started”, “ pre-testing” and I imagine another box would need to be added for the N=20. I feel this would make the methods flowchart more comprehensive.

Author Response:  Thank you this has been included.

Figure 2 & 5: I wonder if it is possible to show the planning domain data as a histogram for the two conditions of before and after adaptations. It would be useful to be able to compare the results directly without looking at 2 separate figures. Plotting percentage of participants on the y axis would allow for comparison despite the different sample size.  

Author Response:  Thank you for this suggestion, however the histograms presented are based on individual scores and we feel this is clearer for the reader given the small numbers used in this study.
