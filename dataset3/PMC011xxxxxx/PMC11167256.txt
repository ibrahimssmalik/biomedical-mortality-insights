==== Body
pmcNephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC) represent one of the most common causes of chronic kidney disease in the first three decades of life and are characterized by a broad genetic and clinical heterogeneity.1 To date, more than 90 genes have been identified that cause autosomal-recessive NPHP-RC if mutated, accounting for up to 60% of cases.1 Among these, homozygous deletions of NPHP1 are the most common cause. Ciliopathy genes localize to primary cilia, basal bodies, or the centrosome and lead to a primary ciliary disruption if mutated, thereby causing a broad phenotypical spectrum.1 Patients that suffer from NPHP-RC can either have an isolated renal phenotype, such as polyuria, polydipsia, decreased urinary concentration ability, and secondary enuresis due to loss of tubular function, or present with extrarenal symptoms including retinal degeneration, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, or hepatic fibrosis. Patients are often diagnosed in early adolescence, reaching end-stage renal disease before 25 years of age, but early onset and rapidly progressive forms of NPHP-RC also exist.1 Renal ultrasound indicates kidneys of normal or reduced renal length with increased echogenicity and corticomedullary cysts.

Due to reduced cost and widely available genomic sequencing, the detection rate of genetic causes of NPHP-RC has increased. To investigate the clinical and genetic findings of a worldwide cohort of 102 families with a clinical diagnosis of NPHP-RC, we performed exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping according to our inclusion criteria (see Supplementary Methods) after obtaining study approval, informed consent, and a clinical questionnaire.

To assess for likely causative variants in known monogenic causes of renal disease, we evaluated for variants in 96 genes known as monogenic causes of NPHP-RC if mutated (Table S1) and in 84 genes known to be causative of kidney disease mimicking an NPHP-RC phenotype (“phenocopies”) (Table S2; Supplementary Methods). We established a monogenic diagnosis in 54 of 102 (53%) families that had a clinical diagnosis of NPHP-RC (Fig. 1 and Table S3, 4). Of these 54 families, 45 (83%) harbored variants in one of the 96 known NPHP-RC genes (Fig. 1 and Table S3). The most frequently identified gene was PKHD1 (17/54 families, 31%), followed by CEP290 (5/54 families, 9%) (Table S3). In 9 families (17%) that were clinically diagnosed with NPHP-RC, we were able to identify a causative variant in a gene that leads to a kidney disease phenotype mimicking a ciliopathy (“phenocopies”) (Fig. 1 and Table S4). Variants were identified in genes causative of congenital anomalies of the kidney and the urinary tract in 4 families (PAX2, HNF1B), and 2 families carried deleterious variants in genes causative of Alport syndrome (COL4A3, COL4A5) or hyperoxaluria (AGXT) respectively. In one family with a clinical diagnosis of NPHP-RC, we identified a deleterious variant in RMND1 leading to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency (OMIM# 614922) (Table S2).Figure 1 Results of exome sequencing analysis of 102 families with NPHP-RC. (A) Exome sequencing data of 109 affected individuals of 102 families with NPHP-RC were analyzed for likely causative variants in known NPHP-RC genes (96 genes, Table S1) or known phenocopy genes (84 genes, Table S2). The inner circle of the pie chart summarizes the main results of exome sequencing analysis indicating the number of families solved for a known NPHP-RC gene [A: blue, 45 of 102 families (44%)] or for a phenocopy gene [B: purple, 9 of 102 families (9%)]. Additionally, it shows the number of families in whom we identified a potential novel cause of NPHP-RC [C: red, 13 of 102 families (13%)], and the number of families in which we did not detect a likely causative variant and where thus declared as unsolved [D: yellow, 35 of 102 families (34%)]. The outer circle of the pie chart divides each group into families with consanguinity lower than 60 megabase pairs (solid color) or greater than 60 megabase pairs (hatched color). The grey parts of the pie chart indicate the number of families in which homozygosity mapping has failed. (B) Clinical characteristics of 109 individuals from 102 families with a presumptive diagnosis of NPHP-RC, defined by increased echogenicity, loss of corticomedullary differentiation, and/or ≥ 2 cysts on renal ultrasound.

Figure 1

We performed homozygosity mapping on all 102 families in whom exome sequencing was performed as previously described.2 37 families had a homozygosity by descent of more than 60 megabase pairs. In this group, we were able to detect a likely causative monogenic variant in 30 of 37 (81%) families (Fig. 1). 59 families had a homozygosity by descent of less than 60 megabase pairs. Here, we detected a likely causative variant in only 24 of 59 (41%) families (Fig. 1). Of note, we identified a higher number of potential novel monogenic candidates for NPHP-RC in patients with low homozygosity (10/59 patients), compared with those with high homozygosity (1/37) (Fig. 1). Homozygosity mapping failed for 6 of the 102 families (Fig. 1).

Importantly, before performing exome sequencing, we excluded patients with NPHP1 deletions. Previous studies that have focused on familial or consanguineous NPHP-RC cases have included patients with NPHP1 deletions,3 or analyzed variants in only a subset of NPHP-RC genes.4 Thus, different genetic “solve rates” have been published explaining up to 64% of the cases.3,5 We recently demonstrated that 63% of 79 familial or consanguineous NPHP-RC families, in which an NPHP1 deletion was excluded, harbored a likely causative variant in a monogenic kidney disease gene.5 Koenig et al found a monogenic cause in 97 of 152 (64%) NPHP-RC patients of a non-consanguineous European cohort.3 However, after excluding these cases, most cases were explained by an NPHP1 deletion (60/152; 39%), equivalent to a genetic solve rate of 40%.3

In the last analysis step, we excluded all previously solved families to assess potential novel monogenic candidate genes causative of NPHP-RC. Variants in the remaining 45/102 families (44%) (Fig. 1) were evaluated using deleteriousness prediction software, allele frequency analysis in healthy control populations, conservation amongst phylogeny, and tissue expression datasets (see Supplementary Methods). We identified 13 potential novel candidate genes (GLOD5, MEAK7, NHSL2, GPR63, NTN5, TRPM4, ZNF679, GPRC6A, TNS1, IQCA1, TFCP2L1, DEGS1, and RHPN1) in 13 of 102 (13%) families (Fig. 1 and Table S5). However, each gene is so far only reported in 1 family. Identification of additional families with variants in one of the potential novel genes plus functional data is required to accept one of the novel NPHP-RC genes. In 35 (34%) families, we were unable to establish a molecular diagnosis. Here, we did not identify any deleterious biallelic variants in known or potential novel NPHP-RC genes (Fig. 1 and Table S6).

NPHP-RC patients can present with extrarenal manifestations in addition to their renal phenotype. We found that involvement of one or more organ systems besides the renal phenotype increased the likelihood of a molecular diagnosis in a known renal disease gene (37/59 patients, 63%) as well as the identification of a potential novel monogenic cause of NPHP-RC (9/59 patients, 15%) compared with the absence of extrarenal symptoms (24/50 patients (48%) and 5/50 patients (10%), respectively) (Fig. 1).

In summary, we performed exome sequencing combined with homozygosity mapping in 109 individuals from 102 families with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of NPHP-RC. We detected a monogenic variant likely causative of the patient's phenotype in 54 of 102 (53%) families. In addition, we identified 13 potential novel NPHP-RC candidate genes. Our study emphasizes the clinical relevance of performing exome sequencing in patients with a presumptive diagnosis of NPHP-RC. Due to the phenotypic heterogeneity of renal ciliopathies and diseases mimicking such phenotypes, it is imperative to establish a timely molecular diagnosis in patients with an NPHP-RC phenotype.
