==== Body
pmcThe authors would like to make a correction to the previous article [1]. In Figure 6A, an error was introduced in the preparation of this figure for publication.

The error included:

The image treated with 6r (0.05 μM) in 0 h was mistakenly replaced by 6r (0.005 μM). The authors have provided the corrected version of the Figure 6 below. The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused and state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated. Figure 6 Effects of 6r, 6s, 7c, and imatinib on migration and invasion. (A) Cell migration of GIST-T1 cells was inhibited by treatment (36 h) with 6r, 6s, and 7c (0.005 μM and 0.05 μM). (B) Invasion of GIST-T1 cells was inhibited by treatment (48 h) with 6r, 6s, 7c, and imatinib (0.05 μM). (C,D) Percentage wound healing area and relative invasion cells were calculated using ImageJ. (average ± S.D., n = 3 one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; * p < 0.05).
