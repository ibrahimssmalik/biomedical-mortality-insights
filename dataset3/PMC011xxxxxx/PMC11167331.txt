We present a genome assembly from an individual male Protodeltote pygarga (the Marbled White Spot; Arthropoda; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Noctuidae). The genome sequence is 421.1 megabases in span. Most of the assembly is scaffolded into 31 chromosomal pseudomolecules, including the Z sex chromosome. The mitochondrial genome has also been assembled and is 15.48 kilobases in length. Gene annotation of this assembly on Ensembl identified 17,784 protein coding genes.

Background

The Marbled White Spot ( Protodeltote pygarga) is a small noctuid moth. This species has undergone a marked range expansion in Britain and Ireland in recent decades. It now occurs widely in grassland, heathland, woodland and moorland habitats, but is absent from Scotland and northern England ( Randle et al., 2019). Its distribution extends across much of Europe to western and central Asia, and it is also recorded from Japan, Korea and China ( GBIF Secretariat, 2023).

The larval host plants are grasses. This species has a single annual generation and overwinters as a pupa underground ( Waring et al., 2017).

The genome of the marbled white spot, Protodeltote pygarga, was sequenced as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project, a collaborative effort to sequence all named eukaryotic species in the Atlantic Archipelago of Britain and Ireland. Here we present a chromosomally complete genome sequence for Protodeltote pygarga, based on one male specimen from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one male Protodeltote pygarga ( Figure 1) collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (51.77, –1.34). A total of 92-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 7 missing joins or mis-joins and removed 2 haplotypic duplications, reducing the assembly length by 0.45%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Protodeltote pygarga (ilProPyga1) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 421.1 Mb in 33 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 14.9 Mb ( Table 1). The snailplot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of reads on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (99.98 %) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 31 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 30 autosomes and the Z sex chromosome. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Genome annotation report

The Protodeltote pygarga genome assembly (GCA_936450705.2) was annotated using the Ensembl rapid annotation pipeline ( Table 1; https://rapid.ensembl.org/Protodeltote_pygarga_GCA_936450705.2/Info/Index). The resulting annotation includes 17,784 transcribed mRNAs from 17,968 protein-coding genes.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

A male Protodeltote pygarga (specimen ID Ox000464, ToLID ilProPyga1) was collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire (biological vice-county Berkshire), UK (latitude 51.77, longitude –1.34) on 2020-06-13, using a light trap. The specimen was collected and identified by Douglas Boyes (University of Oxford) and preserved on dry ice.

High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI), following a sequence of core procedures: sample preparation; sample homogenisation; HMW DNA extraction; DNA fragmentation; and DNA clean-up. In sample preparation, the ilProPyga1 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice ( Jay et al., 2023). Tissue from the abdomen was homogenised using a PowerMasher II tissue disruptor ( Denton et al., 2023a). HMW DNA was extracted using the Automated MagAttract v1 protocol ( Sheerin et al., 2023). DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30 ( Todorovic et al., 2023). Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation ( Strickland et al., 2023): in brief, the method employs a 1.8X ratio of AMPure PB beads to sample to eliminate shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

Protocols developed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI) Tree of Life core laboratory have been deposited on protocols.io ( Denton et al., 2023b).

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (10X) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from thorax tissue of ilProPyga1 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

The genome note submitted by Boyes et al. reports the genome sequence of the Marbled White Spot, Proto Deltore pygarga. P. pygarga is a small moth that has increased its range across southern Britain and Ireland. It is distributed widely in Europe and Asia as well. It has a single annual generation, pupating underground over winter and the larval host plants are grasses. The male specimen sequenced was collected from Wytham Woods. 92-fold coverage of HiFi reads were generated and assembled with Hifiasm, run through purge_dups, scaffolded with 141 Gb (335x) of Arima2 Hi-C data using YaHS, and manually curated with few interventions necessary. The assembly is chromosome-scale and of high quality, meeting the minimum standards recommended by the Earth Biogenome Project. All protocols are appropriate and well-documented. All data conforms with FAIR principles, with read data and assemblies being available in the ENA. Blob toolkit figures are interactive. Additional QC data are provided at https://tolqc.cog.sanger.ac.uk/, supplementing the figures published in the data note.

No major comments.

Minor comments: A ZZ-male was collected and sequenced. I believe it is usually standard practice to try to sequence the heterogametic sex. The authors should provide an explanation for why they chose a ZZ male. Were there difficulties in collecting females? Are ZW females too hard to assemble? It would help the rest of the reference genome sequencing community to know the rationale for choices made or be made aware of difficulties encountered.

A general comment on the genome-note engine. I would like to see the Table 1 comparison to the now-old VGP standards "Assembly metric benchmarks are adapted from column VGP-2020 of “Table 1: Proposed standards and metrics for defining genome assembly quality” from (Rhie et al., 2021).” changed to a comparison to the latest EBP metric standards. Especially for non-vertebrate genomes.

Is there a way to indicate what protein set was used to annotate the genome with BRAKER2? In order to reproduce the annotation, this information would seem necessary. Please find a way to include such info (from Ensembl rapid) in the genome note template.

The genome of the Marbled White Spot ( Protodeltote pygarga) has been sequenced from a single male individual captured using a light trap. The Marbled White Spot is a commonly occurring moth that is found throughout Europe and has seen a range expansion in Britain.  The genome assembly is 421 Mb large and is scaffolded to 33 scaffolds. The genome could not be fully phased. The QV value is 69.4 and the BUSCO gene completeness at 99.0, which indicate a very complete assembly. The contamination screen found minimal contamination and gene annotation identified 17,784 genes.

Minor comments:

1) The mitochondrial genome has been assembled, but seems to not be extracted/submitted separately. It would be helpful to have the mt genome submitted separate. It would be beneficial for those that are interested in the mitochondrial genome. 

2) Please clarify for what analyzes that the abdomen DNA was used for. The material and methods describe DNA isolation from the abdomen, while all of a sudden thorax DNA is used for HiC. This contradiction should be clarified.

3)The data set used for the blob plot in Figure 2, ERR9248441_cov, is not listed anywhere in table 1. 

Conclusion: the high quality genome assembly of the common Marbled White Spot offers possibilities to study the range expansion of evolutionary properties of the moth family Noctuidae.

The manuscript by Boyes et al present the chromosomal genome assembly for Protodeltote pygarga moth species. This study is seemingly filling a gap in taxonomic sampling by providing the first reference genome assembly for Eustrotiinae subfamily of Noctuidae family.

Overall, the genome note is cohesive and well structured. I can see two minor issues:

- DNA extraction is described in detail only for abdomen, which seemingly was used for PacBio sequencing, but not for thorax which was used for HI-C.

- The reasoning for Z chromosome assignment in a homogametic sample is not provided - was it based on size (largest chromosome)?

The authors present a high quality genome assembly of an individual male of the noctuid moth Marbled White spot. The authors performed long-read and Hi-C sequencing and assembly to reconstruct chromosomal pseudomolecules of both nuclear (autosomes and sex chromosomes) and mitochondrial genomes.

While the overall methodology to generate and analyze the data is robust, I feel that the authors should mention:

1. details of each method

2. rationale for using specific methods

For scientists to follow a similar methodology it is important that the advantages and limitation of the methods are clearly stated. Similarly, for each methods it is also quite important to state the parameters that were used and the reason behind using these particular set of parameters.
