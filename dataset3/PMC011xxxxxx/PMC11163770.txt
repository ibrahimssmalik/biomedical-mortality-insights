Following publication of the original article [1], the authors reported two errors in Fig. 1B and Fig. 2B.

1. The two EP + siGLO and DS + siGLO brightfield/β-gal images from Fig. 2A were accidentally duplicated in Fig. 1B. The images in Fig. 2A are correct.

The images in Fig. 1B are replaced with representative images of untransfected EP and DS cells. The incorrect and the correct figure are given below.

The incorrect Fig. 1:

The correct Fig. 1:

The replacement of these images does not change any of the other data in this figure, nor the conclusion of this figure.

2. The authors also noticed that the panels in Fig. 2B labelled with “DS” were incorrectly labelled. The bar charts and figure legend correctly state that these images are “DS + siGLO” images. These panels are now relabelled as “DS + siGLO”.

This proposed relabelling does not change any of the other data in this figure, nor the conclusion of Fig. 2B. The incorrect and the correct figure are given below.

The incorrect Fig. 2:

The correct Fig. 2:

In both instances, these errors do not change any data associated with these figures, nor do they change the conclusions of the corresponding figures and the paper.
