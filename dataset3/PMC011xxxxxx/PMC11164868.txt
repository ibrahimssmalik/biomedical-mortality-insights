pmcCorrection to: Scientific Reports 10.1038/s41598-023-41700-6, published online 01 September 2023

The original version of this Article contained an error in the Energy optimization algorithm. As a result, the variable ‘Cij’ in Equations 2, to 7 and Figure 1 was incorrectly displayed.

In Equation 2,IPθ,s=cij∑i,jIij′

now reads:IPθ,s=∑i,jcijIij′

In Equation 3,IPθ,s-Pθ,s2=cij∑i,jIij′-Pθ,s2

now reads:IPθ,s-Pθ,s2=∑i,jcijIij′-Pθ,s2

In Equation 4,cij∑i,j∑k=0m2kqkij-Pθ,s2

now reads:∑i,jcij∑k=0m2kqkij-Pθ,s2

In Equation 5,=cij2∑i,j∑k=0m2kqkij2-2Pθ,s∑i,jcij∑k=0m2kqkij+Pθ,s2

now reads:=∑i,jcij∑k=0m2kqkij2-2Pθ,s∑i,jcij∑k=0m2kqkij+Pθ,s2

In Equation 6,∑i,j∑k=0m2kqkij2=∑i,j,k22k=qkij2+∑i≤i′,j≤j′,k≤k′2k+k′+1qkijqk′i′j′

now reads:∑i,jcij∑k=0m2kqkij2=∑i,jcij∑k=0m2kqkij2+2∑i,i′,j,j′i≠i′orj≠j′cij∑k=0m2kqkijci′j′∑k′=0m2′qk′i′j′

In Equation 7,=∑i,j,k22kqkij+∑i≤i′,j≤j′,k≤k′2k+k′+1qkijqk′i′j′

now reads:=∑i,j∑k=0m22kcij2qkij+∑i,j∑0≤k<k′≤m2k+k′+1cij2qkijqk′ij+∑i,i′,j,j′i≠i′orj≠j′∑0≤k,k′≤m2k+k′+1cijci′j′qkijqk′i′j′

In addition, in the Methods section, under the subheading ‘Energy optimization algorithm for the Radon transform’,

“In Eq. 5, the second term is a linear term in the QUBO model, and the third term represents a part of the optimization value. The first term without cij2 is calculated as follows:”

now reads,

“In Eq. 5, the second term is a linear term in the QUBO model, and the third term represents a part of the optimization value. The first term is calculated as follows:”

And

“To derive Eq. 7 from Eq. 6, we can convert the square terms by using qkij2=qkij because qkij is 0 or 1. In the second term of Eq. 7, i, and k cannot be equal to i′,j′ and k′ at the same time. We can calculate the first term in Eq. 5 as the sum of linear and quadratic terms as in Eq. 7.”

now reads,

“To derive Eq. 7 from Eq. 6, we can convert the square terms by using qkij2=qkij because qkij is 0 or 1. In Eq. 7, i,j, and k cannot be equal to i′,j′ and k′ at the same time. We can calculate the first term in Eq. 5 as the sum of linear and quadratic terms as in Eq. 7.”

The original Figure 1 and accompanying legend appear below.Figure 1 A sample, a CT image, and their two sinograms to illustrate the optimization algorithm. (a) This sample is a 30 × 30 Shepp–Logan phantom image. In the case of a general three-dimensional sample, it represents a cross section of the sample corresponding to its axial level. (b) This sinogram was obtained by using the Radon transform with the number of pixels equal to the size of the sample in (a). When using the data obtained from the CT system, it corresponds to the sinogram of the X-ray image. (c) An undetermined CT image composed of combinations of logical qubits. (d) The sinogram obtained by applying the projection to (c) in the same way as to obtain the sinogram in (b). In this figure, the Radon transform was applied to (c).
