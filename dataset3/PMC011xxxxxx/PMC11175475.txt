This study examined land use land cover change and its determinants in Tigray, Ethiopia and its livelihood zones. We used socioeconomic panel, and satellite data, and applied a mixed-effects model to analyse the factors influencing land allocation among different uses, and transition matrix to analyse land cover dynamics. The results revealed that; land use choices were influenced by plot level factors (such as plot elevation, distance, soil type and quality, and land tenure), household characteristics (such as education, dependency ratio, plot size and number owned, income, livestock and asset, perception of climate change, and access to market and main road), and community level factors (precipitation, product price, population density and livelihood zone variations). Transition matrix analysis showed that between 1986 and 2016, 12.8% of forest was converted to bare land, 6.26% bare land was converted to pasture, and 5.84% of cropland was converted to forest. However, net deforestation occurred in most of the livelihood zones. Therefore, local communities faced environmental and socio-economic challenges from capital constraints induced land fallowing, land fragmentation, and unmanaged land cover change. The study recommended sustainable land use planning and management, market linkages, improved access to roads, forestry subsidies, land tenure security, and land consolidation programs.

Land is a crucial resource that supports human existence and development [1]. However, human activities have caused changes to the land system that impact climate, ecosystem services, and land degradation [2–5]. Unmanaged land cover transitions increase the vulnerability of human-environment systems and threaten human well-being [6,7]. Sustainable development promotes environment-neutral economic interests to manage forests, halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity losses, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems [8].

However, in Ethiopia, continuous land use changes have resulted in deforestation and land degradation mainly due to agricultural expansion, overgrazing, deforestation, and settlement development [9,10]. This has led to changes in land cover, which are aggravated by the ever-growing population and increased demands for ecosystem services [11]. One of the most affected regions in Ethiopia is Tigray in the north, which is highly degraded and suffers from low agricultural productivity, food insecurity and poverty [12–14].

Most previous studies on Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change in Ethiopia have focused on change detection and/or macro-level determinant analysis [15,16]. However, few studies have considered both macro-level and household-level drivers of LULC change [17,18]. Moreover, most studies have used cross-sectional data and aggregated analysis units, which may not capture the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of LULC dynamics [19,20].

Similarly, most LULC studies in Tigray have only examined LULC change detections, without identifying the proximate causes of land use change at different levels [9,21–23]. These studies combined Landsat satellite imagery and qualitative data from interviews, FGDs, or document review, and used methods such as visual comparison, matrix analysis, and descriptive analysis to indicate the drivers of change. However, none of these studies, including [24,25], considered the household-level and plot level factors, used panel data to track the temporal dynamics of land use choices, or disaggregated their analysis by livelihood zone (LHZ), even though they tried to use logistic regression model to identify the macro level determinants of land use. Therefore, a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of LULC change and its drivers in Tigray is needed.

To address this research gap, this study aims to examine determinants of land use choices and land cover dynamics in Tigray using socioeconomic panel and satellite images. The novel contributions of this study include: (1) we use a hierarchical model that examines how factors at different levels (plot, household, and community and above) affect land use choice, (2) we analyze land use changes at the plot level within households, (3) we use panel data with repeated measurements for the year 2012, 2014, and 2016 to track how land use choices change over time, and (4) we disaggregate our analysis by LHZ, which is a smaller and more homogeneous unit with regard to livelihoods than river basin or sub-basin. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the materials and methods used in this study. Section 3 depicts the results. Section 4 presents the discussion and Section 5 concludes.

Background

Tigray is a northern Ethiopian region with a population of about 6.1 million. It covers an area of roughly 53,000 km2 and has diverse landscapes, climates, and livelihoods. It has three main agro-climatic zones (lowland, midland, and highland) and 16 LHZs, with elevations ranging from 500 to 3200 meters above sea level (Fig 1). The average annual temperature in Tigray varies from 13–28°C, while the average annual rainfall is between 388–602 mm [26].

10.1371/journal.pone.0304896.g001 Fig 1 Map of Tigray in Ethiopia.

The map shows the location, livelihood zones (LHZs), and enumeration areas (EAs) of Tigray. The LHZ is a spatial classification based on the dominant livelihood activities and agro-ecological conditions [27]. The EA is the primary sampling (smallest geographic) unit, used by the Central Statistics Agency (CSA) of Ethiopia for survey sampling and data availability [28–30]. Source: Author’s own work using ArcGIS software and spatial data on livelihood zones from Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) [https://fews.net] [27] and on Enumeration Area (EA) from CSA of Ethiopia [28].

The region has a diverse and complex agro-ecological system that supports various livelihood activities. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), the region is divided into 16 LHZs, which are geographical areas where people have similar patterns of access to food, income, and markets [27]. The main sources of food and income in each zone are rain-fed or irrigated agriculture and livestock rearing. The region produces cereals (such as teff, wheat, barley, sorghum, and maize), pulses, oilseeds (such as sesame and nug), and gesho (a plant used for making local beer) as the main crops. The main livestock in the region are cattle and shoats (sheep and goats). S1 Table provides more details on the features and descriptions of each livelihood zone.

Agriculture is, then, the mainstay of Tigray’s economy, accounting for about 36.7% of the regional GDP and employing about 83% of the workforce. It is based on a mixed farming system that combines crop and livestock production on the same farm, with 81.4% of farmers engaged in crop production and 14.5% in livestock production [31]. However, the region is challenged by environmental degradation, climate change, food insecurity, and poverty. Deforestation and land degradation have been affecting the region for decades, causing severe soil erosion and yield reduction [12,32,33].

As a result, Tigray is regarded as one of the most drought-prone and food-insecure areas in Ethiopia with frequent droughts occurring every two to four years [34–36]. To address these challenges the government has implemented various policies and programs such as the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), Soil and Water Conservation initiatives (a 20-day/year campaign of all citizens regardless of their PSNP status) and community-based natural resource management approaches (including exclosures and cropland afforestation). These programs have achieved significant success stories that have been recognized internationally [37–39]. However, despite these efforts, there is still a lack of understanding of the underlying causes and dynamics of LULC change in Tigray at different levels. Previous studies have mainly focused on detecting LULC changes using satellite imagery and qualitative data, but have not considered the household-level and plot-level factors, the temporal variations of land use choices, or the differences across livelihood zones. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by conducting a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of LULC change and its drivers in Tigray.

Materials and methods

Data and data source

Socioeconomic data

This research used data from the Ethiopia Rural Socioeconomic Survey (ERSS), which is part of the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study, Integrated Survey on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) project. The ERSS is integrated with the Central Statistical Agency’s (CSA) Annual Agricultural Sample Survey (AgSS), in which the ERSS sample households are a subsample of the AgSS sample households, selected using a two-stage stratified random sampling method. The ERSS/LSMA-ISA sample is representative at the national and regional levels.

The ERSS/LSMA-ISA aims to improve the understanding of the links between agriculture and poverty reduction in Ethiopia by providing high-quality and timely data on the socioeconomic conditions of households, especially in relation to their agricultural activities and outcomes. The ERSS/LSMA-ISA was conducted in three rounds over 2012, 2014, and 2016, with two visits per year, one in the post-harvest season and one in the pre-harvest season. The ERSS/LSMA-ISA collects detailed information on various aspects of rural livelihoods, such as land use, land characteristics, and agricultural practices, household demographics, education, health, labor, consumption, income, assets, agriculture, shocks, food security, and social networks, as well as links plot and community level geo-referenced geospatial data (measures of distance, climatology, soil and terrain, and other environmental factors). The ERSS/LSMA-ISA data, along with its documentation can be accessed for free from the [Data Catalog (worldbank.org)]. For more details on the ERSS/LSMA-ISA overview, questionnaires, data dictionary please refer [LSMS-ISA (worldbank.org)].

This analysis relied on data from 996 households and 2,211 plots (with total of 7,492 fields) in Tigray, a region in northern Ethiopia. The analysis sample consisted of 387 households that were surveyed repeatedly in 37 EAs in all three rounds in rural areas and small towns, where the population is expected to predominantly live on agriculture. Additionally, the analysis conducted a follow-up survey on public climate and LULC change perceptions and opinions with the 387 households who participated in the third round of ERSS/LSMS-ISA data collection, to complement the ERSS/LSMS-ISA data [refer S4 Appendix]. This follow-up survey was conducted in August, 2019.

Satellite image processing and classification

On-demand Landsat images for 1986 and 2016 from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, respectively, were used. We, then, categorized the region’s LULC categories into Cropland, Bare land, Forestland, Pasture land and Other LULC class to fit the existing LULC class in ERSS/LSMS-ISA dataset. The operational definition of each LULC category is given in (Table 1). The choice of years considers major event experienced in the region (famous drought in 1986), the last year of ERSS/LSMA-ISA panel date and data access challenges (difficulties in validating satellite imagery data for additional years due to the large area coverage and security challenges). All Landsat images were accessed free of charge from the US Geological Survey Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science via Earth Explorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). Essential pre-processing operations such as radiometric and atmospheric corrections (Haze reduction) were performed using Arc GIS 10.5 and ERDAS Imagine 14 software. The radiometric correction of Landsat satellite sensors’ Digital Number (DN) values were transformed into radiance and subsequently into top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance [40].

10.1371/journal.pone.0304896.t001 Table 1 Summary of land use land cover categories and descriptions.

Category	Description	
Bare land	Degraded or exposed land devoid of vegetation and mainly includes (mining and construction sites), sands exposed to the surface, non-agricultural bare soils and rocks found in steep slope areas and along river banks	
Forest land	Natural and plantation forests found in the study area include woodlands, shrubs and bushlands that are under government and communal protection and agroforestry areas.	
Pasture land	Landscapes in which grasses are the dominant vegetation types or areas dominated by natural grass, including areas used for traditional grazing	
Crop land	Arable and fallow land grows annual or perennial crops through rain-fed and small-scale or commercial irrigation.	
Other land uses land cover	Areas covered by water, wetlands, and settlement	

We also used ancillary data to improve classification accuracy and support interpretation of land cover changes. LHZ data were obtained from Famine Early Warning Systems Network (https://fews.net/data/livelihood-zones). Digital Elevation Model (SRTM-30m) and its derived datasets such as slope were used to supplement satellite data in mapping land cover, as vegetation classes are often limited to specific agro-climatic conditions. DEM of SRTMGL1 (NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Global 1 arc second (~30 m) V003) was obtained from http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM/SRTMGL1.003/.

A hybrid supervised/unsupervised classification approach was implemented together with successive Geographic Information System operations (spatial analysis) to classify the Landsat imageries based on homogenous land units. First, to determine the spectral classes Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis clustering was performed [41]. Second, ground truth data was collected from field observations as well as Google Earth to associate the spectral classes with the cover types of the already defined classification scheme. Ground truth data for LULC classification and accuracy assessment were collected using different information. The reference data for the 1986 image was gathered by interviewing local elders and using some old toposheets from 1993 and Google Earth to identify known locations in the area. It’s been found that information collected from elderly people using a participatory approach is a reliable source of reference data for validating old land use and land cover maps [42]. To determine the historical land cover status of each sample point, 34 key informant interviews conducted in 2019 and old topo-sheets were used. For the 2016 image, Google Earth’s time slider image was used as reference truth points to gather the necessary reference data. A total of 375 training points were collected using a simple random sampling technique from the five major representatives of LULC classes for each study year. Finally, images were classified using Maximum Likelihood Algorithm based on the training samples developed in the previous step [43]. In order to use the classified maps for further LULC analysis, the classification accuracy was assessed. To ensure accuracy, the thumb rule of Congalton [44] was applied to each LULC class, with at least 75 samples (pixels) collected. A stratified method of random sampling was used to collect sample reference points from individual land cover strata. The number of samples was selected for each map class by assigning equal sample sizes to all strata to favor estimating the accuracy of the user overestimating the overall and producer accuracies. Overall accuracies of 87% and 89% were attained for the 1986 and 2016 classified maps, respectively (S2 Table).

Method of data analysis

We want to examine determinants of land use choices and land cover dynamics in Tigray, a region where agriculture is the main human activity. Land use allocation is a complex and multidisciplinary process that depends on various biophysical and socioeconomic factors that vary across time, space, and decision-making scales [5,45]. To capture this complexity and diversity, a plot-level approach is required that can account for the heterogeneity and dynamics of these factors [46]. However, such an approach faces data availability, scale mismatch, and disciplinary perspective challenges [46,47]. This study overcomes these challenges by applying a mixed-effects model of land use allocation at the plot level, which is the smallest spatial unit of land management by a farming household. Furthermore, this study uses a multi-method land cover change detection procedure to examine the main trajectories of land cover change. S1 Fig depicts the methodology we followed. The following sub-sections presented theoretical and empirical models for the land use choice analysis and methods of land cover change detection adopted.

Theoretical model

Literature on the spatial land allocation theory [48–50], postulates that land is divided between alternative uses according to the highest land rent obtainable, given the land’s special characteristics with regards to location and physical conditions. However, in Ethiopia, land is publicly owned and hence land markets do not exist effectively and land prices reflecting the land rent of a particular land quality class in alternative uses are not available [51].

The existence of capital constraints and imperfect markets in Ethiopia [52,53] further complicates land use and production decisions. Despite these challenges, it can be postulated that farming households in Tigray, who have been granted land use rights, will allocate their land to different uses based on the profitability of each use category [54–58]. This allocation is influenced by the production and sale of their outputs in the existing farm output and input markets, the market prices and demand, and the receipt of input supports and government intervention to mitigate capital constraints and imperfect markets [59–62].

Hence, analysis of the behaviour of land use allocation in Tigray for this study is based on a profit-maximization theoretical model derived in the S1 Appendix. In this modelling it is assumed that farmers will allocate their homogenous land area among different uses according to the profitability of each use, given their constraints and preferences.

Empirical model and estimation

This study specifies a linear equation for each land use/cover choice: which depends on the profitability of each use, given the constraints and preferences of farmers. The profitability of each use is determined by the community level price of each land use output, the characteristics of each plot allocated to each land use, and the household and community level factors that affect land use and production decisions [46].

The dataset used for this study is a plot-level three-round panel dataset, which contains information on the area allocated to each land use (arranged in a nx1 vector grouped by land use type), and on the prices, plot characteristics, and household and community factors (arranged in a nxm matrix of independent variables with block diagonal structure) for a sample of farmers in Tigray region. Land uses in this study are main land purposes of plots (cropland, forest, pasture, fallow and other uses) as outlined in the ERSS/LSMS-ISA dataset. We classify the observed plots of land according to how many times (rounds) they have been assigned to a specific land use category during 2012 to 2016. A plot can have one, two, or three observations, depending on how often it has changed its land use category. The number of observations indicates the degree of sustainability of the plot in a given land use category, which we call the sustainability group. The dataset has then made to have a hierarchical structure: plots are nested within sustainability groups, and sustainability groups are nested within land use types. Such structure of the dataset allows the study to control for unobserved heterogeneity across plots and sustainability groups, and to estimate separate land use/cover equations.

The study assumes that the error terms are correlated across different land uses, sustainability groups, and plots due to the competition for land among different uses and the unobserved plot specific heterogeneity [56,63,64]. The study estimates a three-level mixed-effects model using the maximum likelihood method [65,66]. The model accounts for the correlation of error terms within plots over sustainability group and across different land uses. The model also captures the unobserved heterogeneity at different levels of the hierarchy, sustainability group and plot. Our procedure estimated each land use equations (cropland, pasture, fallow, forest, and other land uses) separately and software used for estimation is Stata version 17. For more details on the empirical model specification and estimation, please refer to S2 Appendix.

Land use/cover change detection

Though the land use allocation specified as mixed-effects model can capture high level of explanation of recent changes in land use, it may fail to capture the long-term trends and patters of land use change due to its low temporal complexity covering only a short duration (5 years) and a few time steps (3 years) [50]. Therefore, we complemented the model with a historical analysis of land cover spatial data, derived from satellite imagery for the periods 1986 and 2016. We used a similar land cover classification scheme that matches the land use classification of plots in the ERSS/LSMA-ISA dataset. However, the land use types (plot level) are also in a very low spatially resolution, and they may not correspond to land cover types that are identified through satellite image processing and remote sensing. We assumed a dominant land cover change process in cases of resolution mismatch between the plot and pixel data [67].

We used two methods in broad to detect and analyse LULC change in Tigray between 1986 and 2016: Growth rate and transition matrix analysis. They are suitable for LULC change analysis, as they can handle complex and non-linear phenomena, such as land cover dynamics [20,68]. Growth rate measures the rate of change of each LULC category over time, and transition matrix analysis shows the proportions of each LULC category that changed or persisted over time. Using the transition matrix analysis, we have conducted: component of change analysis, vulnerability to change analysis, and key signal of change analysis. Component of change measures the gross loss, gross gain, net change, and swap change for each category. Vulnerability to change measures the persistence indices for each category to show their vulnerability to loss, gain, or net change. Key signal of change identifies systematic transitions that deviate from random processes. These techniques are based on the approaches of Briones & Varas [69], Ewunetu et al. [20], Pontius et al. [70], and Alo & Pontius Jr [71]. For details of the arguments and mathematical formulations of each method and technique, please refer to S3 Appendix.

Results

Land use choice analysis

We analyse land allocation to land uses. We describe our model variables. Land without market value is allocated based on profitability which depends product prices [55,72]. Land allocation also depends on land conditions, and socioeconomic and environmental factors [54,57].

Descriptive statistics

Table 2 depicts description of the main variables of the study. About 72% Tigray farmers who decide land allocation are illiterate and have one economically active for each dependent in their five-member households. However, 77% of farmers also engage in non-farm activities. Their main livelihood is farming, owning and cultivating 87% of their land on an average of two to three plots in different locations. In addition, they live on average 1 km away from their plots, which 46% have fair soil quality, 21% are vertisols type, and have high elevation and moderate slope. Despite their low asset ownership and income, they benefit from extension services and have experienced income growth in 2012 to 2016. Nevertheless, they face challenges such as long distances to markets and roads, unstable prices, climate change and high population density. Moreover, the region falls below the national average of annual rainfall.

Note: This table shows the percentage for discrete descriptors and the mean and standard deviation for continuous descriptors. Climate change perception index is constructed by combining individuals’ climate change beliefs, personal experience with extreme weather events, its frequency, severity, and associated livelihood losses. Dependency ratio is derived by dividing the number of dependents (people under 18 or over 64) by the number of working-age people (people between 18 and 64) in the household. Soil quality reflects the household’s assessment of the soil quality as good, fair, or poor. Soil type follows the FAO classification of soil as leptosol, cambisol, vertisol, luvisol, mixed type, and other soil type.

*Prices are quantity weighted average producer prices (Birr/kg). For crop land, products were mainly cereals; for pasture, meat, milk & milk products; for forest, fuelwood, charcoal & honey.

Determinants of land use allocation

We used a mixed model to estimate five land use equations with Stata. Table 4 shows the maximum likelihood results. The LR and Wald tests support a three-level mixed model (intercept heterogeneity) and a joint fit [73]. The AIC in Tables 4 and S3 showed the robustness of results of mixed model compared to separate OLS for each land use equations. Land use equation residuals are also found correlated supporting our specification (Table 3).

The results (Table 4) show that plot-level factors such as elevation, distance to residence, soil type and quality, and tenure affect land use in Tigray. Higher altitude increases fallow and pasture. Longer distance reduces forest and other land uses. Vertisols soil increases fallow and decreases forest land use compared to other types. Fair or poor soil quality reduces cropland and other land uses compared good soil quality while pasture is negatively related to poor soil quality. Tenanted land increases cropland and other land uses compared to owned land.

Household-level factors also affect land allocation. Increase in plot size increases all land uses, while increase in number of plots decreases them. Increase in dependency ratio increases fallow and decreases cropland and other land uses. Being literate head and increase in asset index and climate change perception decrease cropland, while higher asset index increases other land uses. The longer residence distance to market decreases cropland, fallow, and pasture, while longer distance to road decreases other land uses. Livestock ownership and income decrease pasture and forest, respectively.

Community-level factors such as forest product price, precipitation, population density, and livelihood zone variations influence land use. Forest product price increases forest, while precipitation decreases it. Population density increases other land uses. Eastern Plateau (EPL), compared to other livelihood (OTH), allocate less land to cropland while livelihood zone variations have mixed effect on allocation to others land use.

Land cover change

Spaciotemporal distribution of LULC categories

The study showed significant changes in all landscapes over 30 years, with low persistence from 37.1% in Adiyabo Lowland (ALL) to 61.3% in Enderta Dry Midland (EDM) LHZs (Fig 2F). We calculated the long-term trend change of land cover in Tigray and its main LHZs and verified that all LULC types changed over time, except for cropland in Tigray, which seemed almost unchanged (less than 1% declined) in 2016 (Fig 2E). Tigray had less forest (18.7%) and bare land (12.8%) (Fig 2C and 2D), but more pasture (103.6%) and other land covers (84%) (Fig 2A and 2B). Forest degraded most in Humera Sesame and Sorghum (HSS) (42.8%) and ALL (29.2%) but recovered in Central Mixed Crop (CMC) (27.2%) (Fig 2C). Pasture expanded most in HSS (threefold) and ALL (twofold) (Fig 2A), while cropland expanded only in HSS (20.8%) and EDM (18.7%) (Fig 2E). Significant expansion (about 3 to 4 times) in other land covers was also observed in HSS, CMC, and West Central Teff (WCT) LHZs (Fig 2B).

The LULC inter category transition

Component of change. We quantified landscape transitions with respect to persistence, using gross losses and gains, net change, swap, and total change. These components were derived from the transition matrices (S4 Table) and shown in Fig 3. In Tigray, bare land and forest experienced the highest total change, with 34.1% and 30.7%, respectively, followed by cropland (14.1%). However, most of the land cover change in Tigray was swap dominated, which balanced out the losses and gains of different land cover types, resulting in lower net loss of 5.7% and 4.8% in forest and bare land (Fig 3C and 3D) and lower net gain of 5.6% and 5.2% in pasture and other land uses (Fig 3A and 3B). Moreover, dynamics in crop land in Tigray was mainly due to swamp resulting in insignificant net change (Fig 3E).

LULC dynamics across LHZs showed a mixed pattern. Forest was the most dynamic in WCT (40.3%) and HSS (38%) (Fig 3C), while bare land had highest total change in ALL (45.2%), and HSS (44.8%) (Fig 3D). Pasture was the most dynamic in ALL (25.4%) and HSS (21.1%) (Fig 3A), and higher total change was observed in other land uses in EPL (15.1%) and EDM (13.9%) (Fig 3B). In EPL and WCT, cropland had highest total change of 21.8% and 19.1%, respectively (Fig 3E). Most (at least 86%) farming households in each LHZ also perceived such dynamism in cropland, pasture, and forest.

Vulnerability of LULC to dynamic. Table 5 shows persistence indices of LULC dynamics in Tigray. Except for cropland (relatively stable in net change), all categories tended to transition from loss/gain to another category. Forest and bare land lost more area, while pasture and other land uses gained more area than they persisted. Pasture gained the most area (a total increment of 4.4 times or a net gain of 2.7 times its persistence), followed by other land uses (a total increment of twice or a net gain of 1.3 times its persistence). Forest lost the most area (150% lower than its persistence) compared with the rest of the categories, followed by bare land (110% lower than persistence).

LULC categories changed similarly across space (LHZs), except for forest and pasture in CMC. Forest gained more than it persisted (a total increment of 120% of its persistence), while pasture lost more than any other category (a total decrement of 17.7 times or a net loss of 15.6 times its persistence) in CMC (Table 5). Next to crop land, bare land had a lower tendency to change in all LHZs except in ALL, despite having the greatest loss/gain and the second highest total change. This inconsistency can be explained by the size of LULC categories and their persistence levels. Pontius et al. [70] suggested that the largest LULC categories may have large transitions by chance. We separated key and systematic patterns of change from any persistence level and land cover size to avoid misleading signals of transition and spurious landscape dynamics.

Detecting key signals of LULC change. Fig 4 shows how categories change based on gains and losses. Green up-arrows mean more positive changes than expected, red down-arrows mean more negative changes than expected, and yellow hyphens mean random changes. In Tigray and most LHZs, only two changes were random: transition between “pasture and forest” and the loss of “other land uses to bare land,”. In ALL, all changes were systematic, while in CMC, many changes were random, especially to “pasture”. The most important systematic transitions (highlighted light red in Fig 4) with conclusive evidence for a key signal of change (green up arrows for both losses and gains) were from “cropland” to “forest” and from “forest” to “bare land” in Tigray and LHZs, from “bare land” to “pasture” in ALL, HSS, WCT, and Tigray, and from “bare land” to “other land uses” in CMC, EDM, EPL, and OTH.

Table 6 shows that forest and bare land (net loss) and pasture (net gain) changed the most. In Tigray, forest (12.8%) lost to bare land (5.01% more) and pasture (6.26%) gained from bare land (2.74% more) than expected randomly. This was similar in ALL, HSS, and OTH, except in OTH where other land use gained from bare land dominantly. Another change was cropland to forest (3.61% more) in Tigray and all LHZs. CMC, EPL, EDM and OTH also lost more bare land to other land uses than expected unlike others.

Discussion

This study delves into the dynamics of land cover and the determinants of land use allocation by farming households in Tigray, Ethiopia. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we combined a plot-level mixed-effects land use allocation model with trend and transition matrix land cover change detection analysis. The ERSS/LSMA-ISA panel data and satellite imagery for 1986 and 2016 served as the foundation for examining land use and land cover changes across Tigray’s main livelihood zones (LHZs).

Land use choice analysis

Our mixed-effects model assumes land use decision is made annually and incorporates a wide range of explanatory variables from different disciplines. The model is estimated using the ERSS/LSMS-ISA panel data, which provides detailed information on land use, land characteristics, household characteristics, and other biophysical features for representative sample of farming households in Tigray, Ethiopia.

A mixed-effects model showed that plot-level factors significantly impacted land use allocation. Plots near residences were often used for forest or other land uses to prevent deforestation by outsiders [74]. Higher-altitude plots were more likely to be fallowed, possibly for animal feed [54]. Soil quality and type influenced land use choices: better soils favored cropland and pasture and vertisols favored fallow land, agreeing with previous studies [75,76]. Tenanted land was more often used for cropland or other land uses than owned land, reflecting intension of tenants to maximize short-term land returns.

Household-level factors also significantly affected land use. More land use types, especially fallow land, were associated with larger and less fragmented plots. This indicates that farmers in Tigray may use most of their newly acquired land for fallowing (1.7 times greater) and leave their more fragmented land idle, both signifying probable capital constraints that impose restrictions on land use [52]. A higher dependency ratio increased fallow land and reduced cropland and other uses, possibly due to labor shortages in agriculture [77]. Higher head education, asset ownership, and climate change perception decreased cropland area, possibly indicating income diversification [57,78,79]. Increased income/wealth increased demand for built-up land similar to other studies [80,81]. Households perceiving climate change may shift their cropland to other categories as climate warming reduces arable land [81].

Wealthier households or those with more livestock tended to use less forest and pastureland, respectively [82], suggesting that they undervalued the in-situ benefits of forests and preferred larger livestock herds in distant wild grazing areas [83,84]. Market and main road proximity increased the use of pasture, fallow land, and other land uses, indicating that market access and infrastructure availability influenced land use choices by creating opportunities for off-farm activities and livestock production [75].

Product price, annual precipitation, and LHZ also affected land use allocation at the community level. Forest product price increased forest land use, possibly reflecting the profitability of forest products and the conservation incentive [72]. Annual precipitation decreased forest land use, possibly due to the suitability of wetter areas for agriculture in arid Tigray. Land use allocation differed across different LHZs, reflecting biophysical and socio-economic differences among them.

However, though the model obtained high level of explanation for the recent changes in land use, it has a low temporal complexity covering only a short duration (5 years) and a few time steps (3 years). This limits the ability of the model to capture the long-term trends and patterns of land use change [50].

Assuming land use transition implied land cover change, and vice versa, the study analyzed historic satellite data (1986 and 2016) to examine land cover change trajectories, complementing the mixed-effects model of land use allocation determinants. The years of special data were chosen based on the region’s history (the famous 1986 drought), the panel data’s end year (2016), and the data availability issues (satellite image validation problems for other years due to size and security). The study uses a similar land cover classification scheme that matches the land use classification of plots in the ERSS/LSMA-ISA dataset. It also acknowledges the limitations of the satellite data in capturing land cover heterogeneity and diversity within pixels, detecting intermediate land cover changes, accounting land cover changes for recent developments that arise from spatial resolution and temporal frequency mismatches, but the satellite data can still capture the dominant land cover type reducing the noise and uncertainty caused by the spatial resolution mismatch [67].

This change detection analysis revealed LULC dynamics in Tigray and its main LHZs from 1986 to 2016, in line with Betru [85]. The results also indicated that the most alarming change was the systematic conversion of forest (12.8%) to bare land in Tigray and all LHZs except for CMC, where forest cover increased. Forest cover decreased by 18.7% (0.7% per annum) in Tigray, resulting in a net loss of 5.7% of the total landscape. Forest degradation was most rapid in HSS (net loss of 18%), followed by ALL (net loss 10%). This indicates that forest was the most vulnerable and dynamic LULC category in Tigray, followed by pasture. These findings agree with previous studies that reported the ongoing deforestation and forest degradation in Tigray [86,87] and Ethiopia [10,88]. This threatens the environment and the livelihoods of local communities through losses in soil quality, water availability, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, food, and resources. Solomon et al. (2019) stressed that forest cover dynamics in Tigray can affect ecosystem services and livelihood losses.

Besides forest loss, another notable change was the expansion of pasture (6.26%) into bare land in Tigray and most LHZs except for CMC and EDM, where pasture was abandoned. Pasture increased by 103.6%, resulting in a net gain of 5.6% of the total landscape. Pasture expansion was most rapid in ALL and HSS (net gain of 16.5% and 15.8%). However, this did not offset the loss of forest cover to bare land. Cropland was relatively stable (almost zero net loss) but with a swap of 14% of the total landscape.

Despite these unfavorable changes, Farming households in Tigray and all LHZs showed commitment to systematic cropland afforestation, but only CMC saw a net increase in forest cover (8%) by afforesting cropland and pasture. Several studies back cropland-to-forest change in Tigray and Amhara [17,21]. EDM also changed bare land to other uses, likely due to urban growth around Mekelle city and other growing towns in the LHZ.

Policy implications

Based on the findings, this study suggests some policy measures for sustainable land use planning and management in Tigray and its livelihood zones:

Supports and Incentives: To promote forest benefits, the government should provide market linkages, roads, facilities, services, forestry subsidies, and land tenure security for farming households. These can boost their income, food security, and resilience, and foster forest conservation and restoration [89]. Studies revealed that market linkages can reduce rural poverty and hunger [90], forest subsidies can help farmers access markets, credit, and insurance for forest products and services [91], and land tenure security can enhance land resource investment and management [92,93].

Balancing livelihoods and conservation: Policy-makers need to balance the environmental and local community needs, while appreciating efforts to regenerate ecosystems in croplands/pastures. Therefore, cropland and pasture reductions observed in favor of forest should be managed carefully as cropland/pasture reduction should be optimal while allowing ecosystems to recover [94,95].

Land Consolidation Programs: To improve land use efficiency and productivity, government should implement land consolidation programs that reorganize the plots of farmers into larger and more contiguous units, while keeping the same land rights and ownership. Land consolidation programs can also facilitate irrigation, drainage, and other infrastructure, and the adoption of improved land management practices that improve income, food security, and resilience of land users [96,97].

Participatory Approaches: To prioritize forest regeneration on bare land in reafforestation efforts, the government should involve local communities and stakeholders in the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Participatory approaches can also improve the capacity, ownership, and accountability of local actors, and the social cohesion [98,99].

Further Analysis: Land use and land cover changes are complex and dynamic processes that are influenced by multiple factors in multiple dimensions. Therefore, further analysis that requires the use of advanced and comprehensive modeling tools that can capture the all the dimensions is needed.

Conclusion

Using socioeconomic panel and Landsat data, this study examined how various factors influenced land use choice and detect long term trends and patterns of land cover in Tigray and its main livelihood zones from 1986 to 2016. The study showed that land use choice depended on plot, household, and community characteristics, such as plot distance, size and number, household income, forest price, and rainfall. It was also implied that land use allocation was affected by capital constraints that exist, with more fallowing newly acquired land and leaving more fragmentated land idle. This damaged livelihoods.

The study also detected the most important environmental changes in the study area. One was the fast and systematic forest loss (12.8%) to bare land. Forest loss was worst in HSS and ALL zones. The only exception was CMC zone, where forest increased due to cropland and pasture conversion to forest in form of plantation. This means that some farmers gave up their cropland for afforestation, despite its negative impact on their food and income. Another was the fast and systematic pasture gain (6.26%) from bare land. Pasture gain was best in HSS and ALL zones. However, pasture loss happened in CMC and EDM zones. Moreover, forest to bare land conversion was more than bare land to pasture conversion, endangering both the environment and livelihoods.

Reviewer #2: Land tenure is an important topic globally and specifically in the context of Africa due to the different types of land tenure and its effects on land use and land use changes. Land tenure is still underresearched. It looks like if the authors did an extensive data collection and data analysis via household and spatial information. Even though this approach is appreciated, a few things are unclear for me: the overall research question/aim of the study, the specific years where data were used for the analysis (e.g. socio-economic data for 1986), specific methods (details are missing), among others.

Introduction: The Introduction is too short. There should be more content related to similar work of LULCC in the Tigray Region. There are already quite a few publications about LULCC in the Tigray Region. You have tried to provide your arguments (what distinguishes your research from others) but this could be better filled with content. I understand that your manuscript is already quite long but it might be better to shift other content to the annex and rather improve the introduction.

Background: The map needs to be improved (see my comments in the manuscript).

Method: There are existing sources of data that were used (ERSS and LSMS-ISA) but there is not much explanation. Please provide more details about the identification of the representative sample of households, collected variables and their definition, e.g. survey template, reason of data collection, time of the data collection, etc. The research question in “Method of data analysis” does not fit to the objective from the introduction. I am confused what is actually the aim of this study.

Only two years of spatial data were compared (1986 and 2016). The spatial classification of land use types is unclear and needs more specification that is backed-up with references. In addition, no data were available for the year 1986 from the Rural Socioeconomic Survey (only 2012, 2014, and 2016). How this data gap was addressed?

Results: Figure 2c, 3 and 4 are difficult to read and hard to understand. This rather causes confusion. Actually, I stopped reading until the end of the results´ section because it is hard to understand.

Discussion: The methodological discussion is missing. The most recent spatial data is from 2016 - it means, it is 7 years ago and might not reflect current land use changes (current realities). I recommend to use updated spatial information.

Conclusion: The section “Policy implication” is out of place. A conclusion should not show new content. Please add this section to the discussion, give more explanation and support it with references.

References are largely missing that the reader cannot judge about the quality of the work. Information is partially missing, too (especially regarding the spatial land use classification approach and the detection of land use changes).

And please address my comments in the manuscript.

Response to Reviewer #1

Reviewer comment 1

• Line 79: I am not as such convinced why religion was described as it is not relevant to this particular topic

Author response 1

� Thank you for your suggestion. We agree that religion is not relevant to our study on land use choice and land cover change. We have removed the sentence about the respondents’ religious affiliation from the background section, paragraph 1.

Reviewer comment 2

• Line 89-94: is out of the context of this study and hence remove

Author(s) response 2

� Thank you for your feedback. We acknowledge that the paragraph was not relevant to our study on land use/land cover change, as it did not match the temporal scope or the variables of our analysis. Therefore, we have removed the paragraph from the background section.

Reviewer comment 3

• The 17 livelihood zones and enumeration areas should have been briefly described for readers and supported with relevant literature. Please provide some background information with regard to these two important concepts indicated.

Author(s) response 3

� We think this is good suggestion. We have added a short description of the enumeration areas (EA) and the livelihood zones (LHZ) in lines 83-96. The LHZ is a spatial classification based on the dominant livelihood activities and agro-ecological conditions, while the EA is the primary sampling (smallest geographic) unit, used by the Central Statistics Agency (CSA) of Ethiopia for survey sampling and data availability. We have cited the relevant sources for these definitions.

Reviewer comment 4

• Line 98: change "farms" in to " farmers" which It seems that farms are not engaged.

Author(s) response 4

� Thank you for your correction. We have changed the word “farms” to “farmers” in line 99.

Reviewer comment 5

• Line 106-109: Do not you think that soil and water conservation initiatives are one of the components of PSNP? Please try to show the difference if it is actually different? For me it is part of the SLM programs initiated through PSNP.

Author(s) response 5

� Thank you for your comment. We agree that SWC is one of the SLM programs implemented through PSNP. However, we also want to highlight the SWC campaign that the government of Tigray has launched to restore degraded lands, which involves the participation of all farmers regardless of their PSNP status. We have added a sentence to clarify this difference in lines 108-109.

Reviewer comment 6

• Line 126-127: when was the survey conducted? Did you get the same households? Please clarify

Author(s) response 6

� Thank you for your inquiry. We have added more details on the follow-up survey that we conducted to supplement the ERSS, which is part of the LSMS-ISA project by the World Bank. This survey reached out to all the 387 households who participated in the 3rd round of ERSS/ LSMS-ISA in August 2019. We have mentioned this information in lines 137-141.

Reviewer comment 7

• Line 152: How many key informant interviewees were used and why?

Author(s) response 7

� To validate the old LULC maps, we interviewed 34 key informants (one from each EA) who were elderly people. The number of interviews was limited by the resource and access constraints, as we conducted them along with the ERSS/LSMS-ISA follow-up survey. This is indicated in lines 175-176.

Reviewer comment 8

• Line 210-215: repeated

Author(s) response 8

� Thank you for your observation. We have removed the duplicate paragraph from page 12, under empirical model and estimation.

Reviewer comment 9

• The discussion section must be organized in to sub heading similar to the results section

Author(s) response 9

� Thank you for your suggestion. We have followed your recommendation and divided the discussion section into three subsections: (1) land use choice analysis, (2) land cover change, and (3) policy implications, matching the results section. Introduced subsection headings are indicated in lines 425, 464 and 500, respectively.

Response to Reviewer #2

Reviewer comment 1

• Introduction: The Introduction is too short. There should be more content related to similar work of LULCC in the Tigray Region. There are already quite a few publications about LULCC in the Tigray Region. You have tried to provide your arguments (what distinguishes your research from others) but this could be better filled with content. I understand that your manuscript is already quite long but it might be better to shift other content to the annex and rather improve the introduction.

Author(s) response 1

� Thank you for your constructive feedback. We understand your concern about the introduction section being too short and lacking sufficient content on LULC change in Tigray. We have revised the introduction section by adding more references on LULC change in Tigray and highlighting the research gaps that our study addresses. We have also moved some content to the annex to shorten the manuscript. Please see lines 57-66 for the revised introduction section.

Reviewer comment 2

• Background: The map needs to be improved (see my comments in the manuscript).

Author(s) response 2

� Thank you for your feedback on the map of the study area. You wanted us to define the enumeration area (EA) and the land use (LU) types, and to show the LU types on the map. We have updated our manuscript to explain the EA and the livelihood zones (LHZ) on the map. The EA is the smallest geographic unit used by the central statistics agency (CSA) of Ethiopia for survey sampling and data availability. The LHZ is a spatial classification based on the dominant livelihood activities and agro-ecological conditions. We have added these definitions to the caption of Fig. 1 in lines 83-87 and to the introduction section in lines 88-96. LU types in this study are the main land purposes of plots (cropland, forest, pasture, fallow and other uses) as defined in the Ethiopia Rural Socioeconomic Survey/ World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study, Integrated Survey on Agriculture (ERSS/LSMS-ISA) dataset. We do not show plot level LU types on the map due to confidentiality terms of using the ERSS/LSMS-ISA. We have defined LU types in lines 229-230. We have removed the map of land cover types, as requested by the editor, due to some copyright issues. We apologize for this inconvenience and thank the editor for noticing it. We hope that this answers your questions and that you are happy with our revisions.

Reviewer comment 3

• Method: There are existing sources of data that were used (ERSS and LSMS-ISA) but there is not much explanation. Please provide more details about the identification of the representative sample of households, collected variables and their definition, e.g., survey template, reason of data collection, time of the data collection, etc. The research question in “Method of data analysis” does not fit to the objective from the introduction. I am confused what is actually the aim of this study.

Author(s) response 3

� Thank you for your feedback. We have revised the sub-section on data source and method of data analysis (lines 115-141) to provide more information about the socioeconomic data, both ERSS and its follow-up survey, which captured the public perceptions of climate and LULC change. We have explained the following aspects of the surveys: (1) their aim and scope, (2) their sampling strategy and size, (3) their main variables and definitions (or survey templates in S4_Appendix), (4) their timing and rationale, and (5) their availability and access. We are sorry for the inconsistency between the objective in the method of data analysis and in the introduction. This was a mistake that we made while editing the manuscript. We have fixed it in line 190, to match the objective in the introduction. We hope that this clarifies your concerns and that you are satisfied with our revisions.

Reviewer comment 4

• Only two years of spatial data were compared (1986 and 2016). The spatial classification of land use types is unclear and needs more specification that is backed-up with references. In addition, no data were available for the year 1986 from the Rural Socioeconomic Survey (only 2012, 2014, and 2016). How this data gap was addressed?

Author(s) response 4

� Thank you for your feedback. We have revised the manuscript to address the issues you raised about the spatial data and the land use classification. We admit that using only two years of spatial data (1986 and 2016) and having no data for 1986 from the ERSS may affect the validity of our analysis. We justify our choices and solutions as follows: First, we encountered two challenges when analyzing LULC change with the panel data from ERSS/LSMS-ISA for 2012, 2014, and 2016. The panel data enabled us to study land use allocation with a mixed-effects model, which explained the recent changes in land use well. However, the panel data had a low temporal resolution (5 years and 3-time steps), which limited our ability to capture the trends and patterns of land use transitions. Therefore, we used spatial data from satellite imagery (LandSat) for 1986 and 2016 for the whole region, to detect more reliable and noticeable land cover change. This created a temporal and spatial mismatch with the land use allocation analysis. We addressed this by combining the long-term land cover change analysis with the short-term land use allocation analysis, while keeping our objective (to examine the determinants of land use choices and land cover dynamics in Tigray). We acknowledged the limitation of this approach in lines 249-258. Second, we selected 1986 and 2016 as the two years of spatial data for these reasons (lines 147-150). We matched 2016 with the year of the panel data (2012-2016). We chose 1986 because it was a drought year in Tigray, Ethiopia, which contrasted with the current situation. Another reason was the difficulty of satellite image processing for such a large area. We wanted to add more years in between, but the war in Tigray in 2020 and the communication blackout stopped us from doing so. We decided to continue with our analysis with the data we had for about 3 years of crisis. Third, we explained the spatial classification of land use types in depth and added more references to support it in lines 143-188. We had land use classification from the panel data at the plot level as cropland, forest, pasture, fallow, and other uses, but the classification from satellite imagery processing was: cropland, grassland/pasture, forest, bushland, bare land, and others. To harmonize the classifications, we used information from the key informant interviews (KII) during the ERSS/LSMS-ISA follow-up survey. The informants said that Natural and plantation forests found in the study area include woodlands, shrubs and bushlands that are under government and communal protection and agroforestry areas. We agreed with the respondents’ definition of forest and included bushland and shrubs in it.

Reviewer comment 5

• Results: Figure 2c, 3 and 4 are difficult to read and hard to understand. This rather causes confusion. Actually, I stopped reading until the end of the results´ section because it is hard to understand.

Author(s) response 5

� Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry for the confusion caused by the graphs of land cover change analysis in the results section. We have made the following changes to improve our presentation: (i) We focused on the change detection based on trend and transition matrix, as suggested by the reviewer, instead of change detection based on change in land cover share. We also deleted the land cover maps, as requested by the editor, due to some copyright issues. (ii) We separated the trend change in land cover (previously Fig. 3a) from the net change (previously Fig. 3b) and made a standalone figure (Fig. 2). We combine net change in land cover (Previously Fig. 3b) and swamp and total change in land cover (Previously Fig. 4a) and made them a standalone figure (Fig. 3). Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show consistent patterns of land cover change, while Fig. 3 also shows additional information components of change (net, swap, and total changes). (iii) We replaced the persistence indices of each land cover type (previously Fig. 4b) with a table (Table 5) to make it easier to compare the values. You can see the changes made in (i) and (ii) in the new Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 and their captions in lines 342-346 and lines 357-362, respectively. The change made in (iii) is indicated in lines 378-380. (iv) We also rounded the values reported on figures to one decimal place. This may cause some minor changes in numbers. We also rewrite sentences in the results section to match the new presentation format (lines 340-341 and line 350-356). We hope that these changes will make our results clearer and easier to understand.

Reviewer comment 6

• The methodological discussion is missing. The most recent spatial data is from 2016 - it means, it is 7 years ago and might not reflect current land use changes (current realities). I recommend to use updated spatial information.

Author(s) response 6

� Thank you for your constructive feedback. We have updated our manuscript to include more methodological discussion in the discussion section. We have added four new paragraphs that cover the following points: (i) The model and the method we used to analyze land use allocation and land cover change, and the data we used for this purpose (lines 418-424). (ii) A short description of the mixed effects model (its assumptions) and the ERSS/LSMA-ISA data we used to fit the model (lines 426-430), and the model’s limitation in capturing long term land use change trends and patterns (lines 460-463). (iii) A short explanation of the approach we followed to detect land cover change, the data we used, and the challenges and limitations of using satellite data, such as spatial resolution and temporal frequency mismatches, limited ability to capture land cover heterogeneity and diversity within pixels, and intermediate land cover changes (lines 465-476). (iv) We added relevant literature citations to support each paragraph. We understand your concern about the timeliness of the spatial data. We selected the 2016 data because it matched the last year of the ERSS/LSMA-ISA panel data, which was the main source of information for the land use allocation determinants. However, we recognize that the ERSS/LSMA-ISA for 2018/19 is a new panel and is not a continuation of the previous ESS waves (Ethiopia - Socioeconomic Survey 2018-2019 (worldbank.org)). Moreover, we had difficulties in getting and validating satellite imagery data for other years due to the large area coverage and security issues in th

Reviewer comment 1

• Line no. 79-80 Agro-climatic zone is a land unit in terms of major climates, suitable for a certain range of crops and cultivars but the name suggests it is based on elevation. Please clarify.

Author response 1

� Thank you for your question. We agree that the agroclimatic zonation we used is specific to Ethiopia and may not be applicable to other regions. The agroclimatic background of the region is based on the traditional zonation that reflects the major physical conditions and agricultural land uses according to altitude and crop patterns. Elevation is a key factor that influences temperature and rainfall in Ethiopia. This traditional zonation has been validated by several studies, such as Hurni (1998), who defined the following zones:

o Bereha: hot lowlands below 500 meters, with limited crop production in the arid east and root crops and maize in the humid west.

o Kolla: lowlands between 500 and 1,500 meters, with sorghum, finger millet, sesame, cowpeas, and groundnuts as predominant crops.

o Woina Dega: midlands between 1,500 and 2,300 meters, with wheat, teff, barley, maize, sorghum, chickpeas and haricot beans as predominant crops.

o Dega: highlands between 2,300 and 3,200 meters, with barley, wheat, highland oilseeds, and highland pulses as predominant crops.

o Wurch: highlands between 3,200 and 3,700 meters, with barley as a common crop.

o Kur: highland areas above 3,700 meters, mainly used for grazing pasture.

The dominant agroclimatic zones in Tigray are: Kolla (lowlands), Woina Dega (midlands) and Dega (highlands).

Reviewer comment 2

• Background - should also include the gap in research which this paper is addressing with the objectives.

Author(s) response 2

� Thank you for your valuable feedback. We appreciate your attention to detail. In response to your suggestion, we have now incorporated a paragraph in the background section (lines 111 to 117) that explicitly outlines the research gap this paper aims to address. This addition will provide readers with a clearer understanding of the context and objectives of our study.

Reviewer comment 3

• Methodology- can you show the whole methodology in flowchart form. It will make the reader to understand the whole thing better.

Author(s) response 3

� Thank you for your feedback. We have addressed your suggestion by including a flowchart that visually represents the methodology. The flowchart has been added in lines 205 to 206. Additionally, the caption for this flowchart, which is included as supporting information, can be found in the supporting information list at lines 789 to 790. This should enhance the reader’s understanding of the entire process.

Reviewer comment 4

• Line no. 170- Change the word to Classification from calcification.

Author(s) response 4

� Thank you for your observation. We have addressed your comment by replacing “Calcification” with “Classification” in line 176.

Reviewer comment 5

• Line no. 171- Please tell the year in which you have interviewed the 34-key informant.

Author(s) response 5

� Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your attention to detail. The key informant interviews with elderly individuals were conducted in August 2019, during the ERSS/LSMS-ISA follow-up survey. As a result, we have now included the year in line 182 to provide clarity.

Reviewer comment 6

• Line no. 178- A total of 375 sample points. It is not sampling points it is training points for supervised classification to create signature file.

Author(s) response 6

� Thank you for your comment. The term “sampling points” has been revised to “training points” in line 184 to accurately reflect the purpose of these.

Reviewer comment 7

• Line no. 281- crop farming can be simply written as farming.

Author(s) response 7

� Thank you for your valuable feedback. Based on your suggestion, we have replaced “crop farming” with the more concise term “farming” in line 287.

Reviewer comment 8

• As far as I understood, for LULC you have taken data of 1986 and 2016, while for socio economic study the data is of 2012 to 2016.

Author(s) response 8

� Thank you for your valid concern. We have used land cover data for two time points: 1986 and 2016. We have corrected all the instances where we mistakenly wrote “1986 to 2016” instead of “1986 and 2016” when describing the data we used. Please see lines 428 and 472 for the changes.

Reviewer comment 9

• It is not vertosol, I think its soil order vertisols. Please rewrite the sentence.

Author(s) response 9

� We appreciate your observation. You are correct, the soil order is vertisols, not vertosol. We have revised the sentence accordingly in Table 2 and 4 and line numbers 289, 312, and 441.

Reviewer comment 10

• Line no. 298- STATA is same the software name you mentioned earlier? If so maintain the same format.

Author(s) response 10

� We thank you for your attention to detail. You are right, the software name is Stata, not STATA. We have corrected this typo in line 304 and ensured consistent formatting throughout the manuscript.

Reviewer comment 11

• Line no. 401- if you have used 1986 data and 2016 do not write 1986-2016, instead write 1986 and 2016.

Author(s) response 11

� We are grateful for your observation. This is the same issue as in response 8. We have changed “1986 to 2016” to “1986 and 2016” in line 428 and elsewhere as appropriate.

Dear Dr. Josily Samuel,

We are grateful for your and reviewer constructive feedback on our manuscript entitled “Multi-level determinants of land use land cover change in Tigray, Ethiopia: A mixed-effects approach using socioeconomic panel and satellite data” (manuscript number PONE-D-23-33020), submitted to PLOS ONE. We appreciate your consideration of our work for revision.

This letter explains how we have revised our supplementary information named S1_flowchart in response to the reviewer’s comments. We hope that our revisions meet your expectations, and our manuscript is now ready for publication in PLOS ONE.

We have prepared a point-by-point response to each issue raised by you and the reviewer. We have also listed the changes that we have made in the revised supplementary information.

Please find below our detailed responses to you and the reviewer, followed by the list of changes that we have made.

We thank you and the reviewer for your valuable feedback and your time and effort in reviewing our manuscript. We hope that you will find our revisions satisfactory and accept our manuscript for publication in PLOS ONE.

Sincerely,

Tadele Tafese Habte

Centre for Environment and Development, College of Development Studies, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

Response to Reviewer #3

Reviewer comment 1

• The reviewer put comments [hand written] on the S1_flowchart attached to email and requested to revise accordingly.

Author response 1

� Thank you for your comments on the flowchart summarizing the methodology. In response to the reviewer’s clear and direct feedback, the S1_flowchart has been revised to incorporate the suggested additions and deletions. The concepts indicated by the reviewer have been integrated, and unnecessary elements have been removed as per the guidance provided. Specifically;

o We have clarified the types of data utilized: socioeconomic and satellite data, and have removed questioning data availability. Additionally, we have detailed the two sources of socioeconomic data used, namely primary and secondary data sources.

o In response to the comment on land use classification, we acknowledge the hybrid approach taken in our methodology. Initially, we employed unsupervised techniques for class identification, using Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis clustering to group pixels based on spectral similarities. Subsequently, ground control points (GCPs) collected via high-resolution imagery from Google Earth and GPS coordinates served as training data for a supervised Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) algorithm. This refined the land use categories with established spectral signatures. Although our classification process involved these stages, the final supervised MLC algorithm determined our classification. Therefore, we have specified the application of supervised image classification in the revised flowchart.

o We appreciate your concern regarding the temporal data representation. We have corrected the temporal data representation from “1986 to 2016” to the specific time points: 1986 and 2016, as used in our manuscript.

o We concur that the back loop to the research question is redundant once the research question has been addressed. The flowchart has been updated to remove this loop, aligning with the recommendation.

We are committed to ensuring the highest quality of our work and are open to further revisions should there be additional feedback.
