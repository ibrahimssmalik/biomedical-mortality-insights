In this study, a novel strain for degrading chitin was identified as Bacillus paralicheniformis HL37, and the key chitinase CH1 was firstly mined through recombinant expression in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens HZ12. Subsequently, the sequence composition and catalytic mechanism of CH1 protein were analyzed. The molecular docking indicated that the triplet of Asp526, Asp528, and Glu530 was a catalytic active center. The enzymatic properties analysis revealed that the optimal reaction temperature and pH was 65 °C and 6.0, respectively. Especially, the chitinase activity showed no significant change below 55 °C and it could maintain over 60% activity after exposure to 85 °C for 30 min. Moreover, the optimal host strain and signal peptide were obtained to enhance the expression of chitinase CH1 significantly. As far as we know, it was the first time finding the highly efficient chitin-degrading enzymes in B. paralicheniformis, and detailed explanations were provided on the catalytic mechanism and enzymatic properties on CH1.

pmc1. Introduction

Chitin is alkaline polysaccharide extracted from the shells of marine crustaceans, and it is the second most abundant biopolymer resource in the world [1]. Chitin is widely used as an industrial clothing fabric [2], feed supplements [3], and a wound healing agent in medicine [4]. Chitin can be hydrolyzed to produce N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and (GlcNAc)2, and they have multiple biological activities, such as antibacterial, antioxidant, and immunostimulatory activities [5,6,7,8]. At present, GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 have extensive applications in fields, such as food, skincare, and biomedicine skincare [9,10,11,12,13]. In the food industry, GlcNAc is used as a dietary supplement [9]. In the field of biomedicine, GlcNAc can alleviate symptoms of osteoarthritis [14]. GlcNAc exhibits a chondroprotective action by inhibiting type II collagen degradation in the articular cartilage [14]. Especially, GlcNAc-related products are very popular in European, American, and Japanese markets, and they are mainly used as a dietary supplement for the prevention and treatment of osteoarthritis [15,16,17]. In the skincare industry, GlcNAc can inhibit melanin production and reduce the appearance of wrinkles [10,11]. (GlcNAc)2 can be used as the inducer of bacterial chitinase [12], anti-diabetes activity, lipid-lowering activity, and antioxidant properties [13].

At present, the methods for degradation of chitin mainly include acid hydrolysis and biodegradation. Among them, the acid hydrolysis method has low cost but it uses a large amount of acid and alkali during the preparation process, which seriously pollutes the environment [18,19]. Biodegradation methods include microbial fermentation and enzymatic methods, and the essence is that chitinase plays a degrading role. The fermentation method utilizes chitinase produced by microorganisms to degrade chitin, and many microorganisms can directly produce GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 through fermentation of chitin, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Aspergillus niger [20,21,22,23]. The enzymatic method utilizes extracted chitinase to degrade chitin into GlcNAc or (GlcNAc)2, and chitinase directly reacts with substrate chitin rapidly [5,24]. Both methods have the advantages of low cost, gentle reaction, and high safety [25,26], but the bio enzymes produced by fermentation of wild strains have low activity and are unresistant to high temperatures. Therefore, it has great industrial prospects for mining efficient chitinase by the biodegradation method.

Previous studies have reported a wide variety of species with the capacity to manufacture chitinase, including Serratia marcescens [27], Trichoderma harzianum [28], Bacillus aryabhattai [29], Aeromonas caviae [30], Paenibacillus barengoltzii [23], B. subtilis [31], and Cellulosimicrobium funkei [32]. Many studies have shown that it is feasible to express heterologous chitinase in type strains for biodegrading chitin, such as E. coli, B. subtilis, and Pichia pastoris [30,33,34]. However, the expression system of E. coli produces endotoxins, seriously threatening the safety of food and drugs [35]. The commonly used yeast is eukaryotes, with complex operations and a long fermentation cycle [36]. Consequently, as many Bacillus spp. are food-grade safe strains and have a strong ability to produce extracellular enzymes and grow rapidly, Bacillus enzyme preparations have found extensive application in the food business [37,38]. Therefore, Bacillus species have the potential to express the chitinases.

In this study, the Bacillus paralicheniformis HL37 with high degradation ability of chitin was obtained through thermostability screening, and the key enzyme chitinase CH1 was identified by recombinant expression and sequence analysis. Subsequently, we investigated the specific degradation mechanism and evaluated the enzymatic properties. Then, the chitinase production efficiency was also improved by optimizing the host strain and signal peptide. It was the first time that the chitinase was found in B. paralicheniformis, and this chitinase had great application potential for the degradation of chitin.

A total of 1 mL supernatant was taken and spread on colloidal chitin agar. After culture at 37 °C for 3 days, colonies with transparent rings were transferred into chitin culture medium and inoculated at 140 rpm for 3 days. After centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min, the supernatant was sterilized through a 0.22 μm filter membrane and added to the wells of the colloidal chitin agar plates for incubation at 37 °C. The strain with the largest transparent circle diameter was selected. The sequences of screened strains were amplified using 16S rDNA primers (27F: AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG, 1492R: GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT) and sequenced by Tsingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). The sequence similarity analysis was performed by BLAST, and a phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA 11.

The ch1 gene fragment was acquired from B. paralicheniformis HL37; then, restriction enzymes XbaI and BamHI were used to digest the ch1 gene fragment and pT17 plasmid. Subsequently, T4 DNA ligase was utilized to ligate the ch1 gene fragment and pT17 plasmid to generate the expression plasmid pT17-ch1. Finally, the pT17-ch1 was electro-transformed into B. amyloliquefaciens HZ12 to obtain the recombinant strain HZ12/pT17-ch1. All recombinant strains in this study were constructed by using the same procedure.

2.6. Shake Flask Fermentation

After centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min, the solid precipitate was rinsed three times with 200 mL ethanol and then placed at 37 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, 15 μL 8 mmol/L urea, 15 μL 2 mmol/L thiourea, and 15 μL 2 × SDS buffer were sequentially added to solid precipitate. The mixture was placed in boiling water at 100 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, 10 μL of the mixture and 180 kDa pre-stained protein marker were added to different wells of the SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoretic analysis.

2.9. Analysis of GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 by HPLC

The HPLC detection method for GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 refers to previous research [41]. Firstly, the fermentation broth was centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min. Then, the supernatant was diluted 40 times and filtered through 0.22 μm filter membrane. The GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 were analyzed using an Agilent 1260 HPLC equipped with Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories (San Clara, CA, USA). The column temperature was controlled at 40 °C and the injection volume was 10 μL. The mobile phase was 5 mmol/L aqueous sulfuric acid and the flow rate was 0.6 mL/min.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Screening and Identification of Chitin-Degrading Bacteria

In order to screen for thermostable strains, the wild bacteria cultures were placed in an 80 °C water bath for 10 min. Then, the transparent circle method was used to screen the target strain, and a thermostability strain that could efficiently degrade chitin was successfully obtained, named HL37. Then, the 16S rDNA fragment of HL37 was amplified by PCR using 16S rDNA primers and compared by BLAST, which showed that HL37 had the highest similarity to B. paralicheniformis (CP033198.1). To further determine the evolutionary relationship of HL37, some representative Bacillus genera were selected to construct a phylogenetic tree. As shown in Figure 1, HL37 had a higher affinity with B. paralicheniformis compared to other Bacillus, further confirming that HL37 belonged to B. paralicheniformis.

Currently, several studies showed that Bacillus had the ability to degrade chitin, including Bacillus aryabhattai, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus velezensis, and B. subtilis [29,31,44,45]. In addition, Iqbal et al. predicted the potential chitinase existing in B. paralicheniformis through genomic sequencing and annotation, while there was no experimental evidence to support the conclusion [46]. In this study, it was the first time discovering that B. paralicheniformis HL37 had the ability to degrade chitin.

3.2. Identification of Chitinase Genes

In order to discover the key chitinase in B. paralicheniformis HL37, we screened two genes ch1 and ch2 from B. paralicheniformis on KEGG and constructed the recombinant expression strains HZ12/pT17-ch1 and HZ12/pT17-ch2. As shown in Figure 2A, there was no significant difference in chitinase activity between the recombinant strain HZ12/pT17-ch2 and the control strain HZ12/pT17, and the chitinase activity of the HZ12/pT17-ch1 was much higher than that of the control strain. When the fermentation time reached 36 h, the chitinase activity of HZ12/pT17-ch1 reached 1.46 U/mL, which increased by 118% compared to control strain HZ12/pT17. This result indicated that ch1 was the key gene for chitin degradation in strain B. paralicheniformis HL37.

In addition, HZ12/pT17-ch1 could hydrolyze colloidal chitin to produce GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 (Figure 2B), and it could obtain 0.14 g/L GlcNAc and 7.3 g/L (GlcNAc)2, respectively. A previous study found that GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 had significant anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects [47]. Especially, (GlcNAc)2 showed the function of relieving type 2 diabetes [32], which had the potential to be developed into a health food. Therefore, the ch1 gene encoded chitinase provided potential resources for the development of health foods. Furthermore, the gene ch1 had similar functions with gene rch1 in Bacillus clausii TCCC 11004; it could hydrolyze colloidal chitin to produce GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 [48]. Then, the ch1 gene encoding chitinase CH1 was characterized by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2C). The molecular weight of CH1 was 66.1 KDa, which was consistent with the predicted target protein. In addition, the isoelectric point of CH1 was 5.14, which indicated CH1 was a stable hydrophilic protein. These results were similar with the chitinase RCH1 (66.7 KDa) from B. clausii, and the isoelectric point of RCH1 was 4.51 [48].

3.3. Bioinformatics Analysis of CH1

In order to further investigate the sequence composition of CH1 protein, we analyzed the amino acid sequence using SignalP 6.0. As shown in Figure 3, the result indicated that CH1 contained 599 amino acids and the signal peptide was distributed between 1 and 35 amino acids. Among them, amino acids 8–11 were a strongly hydrophilic sequence formed by Lys-Ser-Lys-Lys, while the retaining amino acids were strongly hydrophobic sequences ending with Ala-Lys-Ala. Subsequently, we selected several homologous proteins for sequence alignment to further determine their specific functional sites. According to CAZy-Home database prediction, chitinase CH1 was classified into Glycoside Hydrolase Family 18 and Glycoside Hydrolase Family 19, which possessed enzymatic properties of these two families. As shown in Figure 4, our CH1 protein (CH1-HL37) exhibited 63.9% similarity to rCHI-Bc obtained from B. clausii (MW250867.1) [48], 96.9% similarity to CHIA-Bl obtained from B. licheniformis (FJ465148.1) [49], 85.0% similarity to CHI-Bs obtained from B. subtilis (AF069131.1) [31], and 88.3% similarity to CHIA-Ba43 obtained from Bacillus altitudinis (MT331611.1) [50]. The high homologous sequence also indicated that CH1-HL37 possessed chitinase properties.

3.4. Analysis of the Mechanism of Action of Chitinase

To further elucidate the catalytic mechanism of chitinase CH1, we used AlphaFold2 to predict the protein structure (Figure 5A), and the results indicated that chitinase CH1 belonged to the GH18 family, which had an eight-strand α/β barrel-shaped structure [51]. Then, we obtained the structure of colloidal chitin fragments (GlcNAc)3 from Pumchem, and Discovery Studio 2019 software was used to simulate molecular docking between chitinase CH1 and (GlcNAc)3. As shown in Figure 5A, some amino acids in chitinase played an important catalytic role, including Trp60, Lys143, Gly485, and Thr486, and these amino acids were responsible for anchoring substrates during the catalytic process. Then, the remaining amino acids Asp526, Asp528, and Glu530 were conserved catalytic triplets and active centers in chitinase.

Furthermore, we analyzed the specific catalytic mechanism of CH1 (Figure 5B). When the substrate (GlcNAc)3 entered the active center of the enzyme, the structure of substrate changed from a chair conformation to a boat conformation under the action of amino acid residues. Then, it caused the carboxyl oxygen atom of the N-acetyl group to approach the heterocyclic carbon (C1), which initiated a nucleophilic attack. Subsequently, Trp60 formed a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl oxygen atom to stabilize the structure, while Asp528 flipped and formed a hydrogen bond with the N-acetyl group to stabilize the intermediate structure. After Asp528 flipped, it approached Glu530 and formed hydrogen bonds to activate proton donors. Then, it would break glycosidic bonds to form intermediate oxazoline ions. Subsequently, the complex of Asp528- and Glu530-catalyzed water molecules aroused nucleophilic attacks on C1 and the intermediate of oxazoline ions disintegrated. At the same time, the Glu530 returned to its initial state and the Asp528 flipped back to its initial position with the assistance of Asp526. Finally, the product was released and hydrolysis was completed [52].

3.5. The Enzymatic Properties of Chitinase CH1

To further understand the properties of chitinase in detail, we investigated the performance of chitinase at different temperatures and pH. As shown in Figure 6A, the CH1 protein maintained high chitinase activity in the range of 35~65 °C. After exceeding 65 °C, the chitinase activity significantly decreased and the maximum activity occurred at 65 °C. In addition, we found that the CH1 protein retained high chitinase activity in the pH range of 5~8 (Figure 6B). The chitinase activity significantly decreased below pH 5, and the activity reached maximum when pH was 6. Similarly, Yuan et al. also reported that the optimal pH of chitinase from B. subtilis was 5 and the optimal temperature was 60 °C [53]. Subsequently, we further investigated the tolerance of chitinase to temperature and pH. When the temperature increased, there was no significant change in enzyme activity below 55 °C (Figure 7A). The enzyme activity began to decrease when the temperature exceeded 65 °C and it still maintained over 60% activity in the range of 65~85 °C, indicating that the chitinase CH1 had good thermostability. In addition, the chitinase activity remained above 80% in the pH range of 5~8 and the chitinase activity significantly decreased when pH was below 5 (Figure 7B). A study found that the chitinase from Trichoderma harzianum only maintained 35.8% activity at 50 °C [28]. In this study, the chitinase CH1 had good thermostability, which contributed to the commercial application.

3.6. Effects of Different Host Bacteria and Signal Peptides on Chitinase Activity

Different host strains might have different impacts on the expression of proteins [54]. To further enhance the fermentation activity of chitinase CH1, we screened the chassis strains for expressing chitinase. The recombinant vector pT17-ch1 was transferred into B. paralicheniformis HL37, B. subtilis SCK6 [55], and B. licheniformis BL10 [56], respectively, generating engineering strains HL37/pT17-ch1, BL10/pT17-ch1, and SCK6/pT17-ch1. Then, we measured the chitinase activity of four strains (including HZ12/pT17-ch1) after fermentation. As shown in Figure 8A, the recombinant chitinase CH1 indicated the lowest activity for BL10/pT17-ch1 and the remaining three recombinant strains HZ12/pT17-ch1, HL37/pT17-ch1, and SCK6/pT17-ch1 showed no significant difference. Therefore, B. amyloliquefaciens HZ12 was chosen as the optimal host strain.

The type of signal peptide could significantly affect the secretion level of recombinant proteins [57]. Therefore, we used SignalP 6.0-DTU Health Tech-Bioinformatic Services to screen and analyze the signal peptide library. Then, five signal peptides were selected for expression of chitinase, namely sp1, sp2, sp3, sp4, and sp5, which had 35, 35, 17, 29, and 27 amino acids, respectively. Subsequently, we used SOE-PCR (gene splicing by overlap extension PCR) to connect signal peptides with gene ch1 and constructed five vectors, namely pT17-sp1ch1, pT17-sp2ch1, pT17-sp3ch1, pT17-sp4ch1, and pT17-sp5ch1, respectively. These vectors were electrotransformed into HZ12 competent cells and obtained five engineering strains, namely HZ12/pT17-sp1ch1, HZ12/pT17-sp2ch1, HZ12/pT17-sp3ch1, HZ12/pT17-sp4ch1, and HZ12/pT17-sp5ch1, respectively. As shown in Figure 8B, chitinase activities of three engineering strains were higher than CK (HZ12/pT17-ch1), including HZ12/pT17-sp1ch1, HZ12/pT17-sp2ch1, and HZ12/pT17-sp5ch1, respectively. Among them, the HZ12/pT17-sp2ch1 had the highest enzyme activity, which reached 1.73 U/mL, and it was 63.0% higher than that in CK. This indicated that the signal peptide sp2 was effective to enhance the expression level of recombinant chitinase CH1.

4. Conclusions

In summary, this study successfully screened a strain HL37 that efficiently degraded chitin and identified its key chitinase gene ch1 through recombinant expression. Moreover, the molecular weight, amino acid sequence, and protein structure of chitinase CH1 were analyzed, and the catalytic mechanism was also explained. Furthermore, the enzymatic properties of chitinase were investigated. The optimal reaction temperature was 65 °C and the optimal pH was 5.0. Through screening of host strains and signal peptides, the enzyme activity of chitinase CH1 was further enhanced. Therefore, the chitinase discovered in this study had potential significance for industrial production.
