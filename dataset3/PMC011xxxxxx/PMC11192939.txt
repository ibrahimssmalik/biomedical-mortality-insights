pmcCorrection to: Scientific Reports 10.1038/s41598-024-63062-3, published online 04 June 2024

The original version of this Article contained errors.

In the Introduction section, the fungal disease associated with the white-nose syndrome was misspelled.

“This region is especially relevant because the ability of Coastal Plain populations to maintain higher activity throughout the winter could translate into lower mortality associated with white-nose syndrome (WNS), an epizootic, infectious fungal disease caused by Pseudogtmnoascus destructans (Pd).”

now reads

Furthermore, in the Results section

“We captured 264 individuals of eight bat species from late-January to mid-March 2021–2022, collecting fecal samples from 206 individuals, from which we selected samples from 195 individuals. After bioinformatics processing and quality filtering, we obtained diet composition from 125 individuals of seven species (Table 1).”
