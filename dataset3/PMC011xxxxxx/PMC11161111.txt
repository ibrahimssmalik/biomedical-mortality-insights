Introduction

Neonatal mortality during the first week of life is a global issue that is responsible for a large portion of deaths among children under the age of five. There are, however, very few reports about the issue in sub-Saharan Africa. For the sake of developing appropriate policies and initiatives that could aid in addressing the issue, it is important to study the prevalence of mortality during the early neonatal period and associated factors. Thus, the aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of and pinpoint the contributing factors to early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.

Method

Data from recent demographic and health surveys in sub-Saharan African countries was used for this study. The study included 262,763 live births in total. The determinants of early newborn mortality were identified using a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model. To determine the strength and significance of the association between outcome and explanatory variables, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) at a 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed. Independent variables were deemed statistically significant when the p-value was less than the significance level (0.05).

Result

Early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa was 22.94 deaths per 1,000 live births. It was found to be significantly associated with maternal age over 35 years (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.34–2.33), low birth weight (AOR = 3.27, 95% CI: 2.16, 4.94), less than four ANC visits (AOR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.33), delivery with caesarean section (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.30–2.5), not having any complications during pregnancy (AOR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61, 94), and community poverty (AOR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05–1.65).

Conclusion

This study found that about twenty-three neonates out of one thousand live births died within the first week of life in sub-Saharan Africa. The age of mothers, birth weight, antenatal care service utilization, mode of delivery, multiple pregnancy, complications during pregnancy, and community poverty should be considered while designing policies and strategies targeting early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.

The term "early neonatal mortality" (ENM) refers to the death of a newborn that occurs within the first week of life [1]. Although neonatal mortality has decreased significantly over the past few decades, it still poses a serious problem for the majority of low-income countries [2]. The early neonatal period is responsible for around 33% of all under-five deaths globally, whereas the remaining 67% happen after one week of life over their five-year period [3]. Of the 2.8 million babies that die throughout the neonatal period globally each year, 73% do so in the first week after delivery (early neonatal period) [1, 4].

Globally, 2.7 million babies lose their lives within the first month of life due to infections, preterm birth problems, and birth asphyxia. Ninety-nine percent of newborn fatalities and stillbirths take place in low- and middle-income countries like those in sub-Saharan Africa [5]. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest newborn mortality rate in 2019 with 27 deaths per 1,000 live births, followed by Central and Southern Asia with 24 deaths per 1,000 live births [6]. A child born in sub-Saharan Africa or southern Asia has a tenfold higher probability of dying in the first month of life than a child born in a high-income country [6].

Only one sub-Saharan African country, Madagascar, was found to have met Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 in the year 2015 [7]. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established during the United Nations meeting in 2015 to succeed the MDGs. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) three has set a target to reduce mortality in children younger than 5 years to 25 or fewer per 1000 live births and the neonatal mortality rate to 12 or less per 1000 live births by 2030 [8, 9]. Despite the fact that neonatal mortality has decreased significantly since 1990, further efforts are required to accelerate this progress and meet the SDG objective by 2030 [10].

The lack of basic antenatal care [3, 11], complications during pregnancy [12], birth weight [13, 14], cultural practices [15], wealth index [16], home delivery [17], difficulty affording health care [18], and low maternal education status [19] were among the factors contributing to neonatal mortality in low and middle income countries.

The early neonatal period, the first seven days of life, are the most precarious for a baby’s survival [6]. Children face the highest risk of death in their first week of life [6], especially in low- and middle-income countries. To the knowledge of researchers, no study has been conducted on neonatal mortality in the first week of life and determinants at inter-country levels in sub-Saharan Africa. Coming up with its magnitude and determinants helps understand the current status of the problem and can be an input for policymakers. Hence, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.

Methods

Data and study setting

The secondary data analysis of recent sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Demographic Health Survey datasets from 2014 to 2019/20 was conducted (Table 1). The datasets were appended together to investigate early neonatal mortality and determinants in SSA. The data were accessed from the official Demographic Health Survey program database (http://www.dhsprogram.com). The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are surveys that are nationally representative and offer data that is comparable across nations to monitor and assess impact indicators in the areas of population, health, and nutrition. The DHS uses a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. The first stage is to select enumeration areas, and the second stage is to draw a sample of households in each enumeration area. We used DHS surveys in 23 sub-Saharan African countries. This study used the children’s record dataset to determine the outcome variable. A sample of 262,763 live births was included in the study (Table 1). While all babies born alive from women of reproductive age five years before the surveys in sub-Saharan Africa were the source population, all live births in the enumeration areas of the survey were the study population.

Measures

The outcome variable for this study was early neonatal mortality, which was dichotomized as "yes" = 1 for neonates who died within one week of life and "no" = 0 for neonates who were alive within one week of life. Considering the hierarchical DHS data, two-level explanatory variables (individual and community) were used to identify the determinants of early neonatal mortality. The individual-level variables included maternal age, maternal education, place of delivery, birth weight, type of pregnancy, mode of delivery, household wealth index, birth order, type of pregnancy, antenatal care (ANC) utilization, and pregnancy complications. In this study, missing values have been managed by dropping variables assigned as don’t know and unspecified numbers.

Place of residence, country, community illiteracy level, and community poverty level make up the community-level variables. The individual-level variables of maternal education and household wealth index, respectively, were aggregated to determine the community levels of illiteracy and poverty.

Statistical analysis

Once extracted from the source, the data from each country has been appended together to create one single file dataset using Stata 14. To draw valid inferences, the weighting was done using the weighting variables [sample weight (v005), primary sampling unit (v023), and stratum (v021)]. Because DHS data is hierarchical in nature, a multilevel mixed effect logistic regression model was applied to assess determinants of early neonatal mortality in SSA.

Multilevel mixed effect logistic regression has four models; the null model, model I, model II, and model III. Null model is used to determine the applicability of multilevel to the data by determining measure of variation. Model I uses to determine the effect of only individual level factors on early neonatal mortality. Model II uses to determine the effect of community level factors on early neonatal mortality. The last model (model III) shows the effects of both individual and community level factors on the mortality. Multilevel logistic regression is equated as follows, logΠij1−Πij=βo+β1x1ij+⋯+βnxnij+uoj+eij

Where; πij is the probability of baby to die within one week of life, (1-πij) is the probability of baby not to die within one week of life, βo is log odds of the intercept, β1, … βn are effect sizes of individual and community-level factors, x1ij … xnij are independent variables of individuals and communities. The quantities uoj and eij are random errors at cluster levels and individual levels respectively.

The measurement of variation (random effect) was done using the median odds ratio (MOR), intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC), and proportional change in variation (PCV). The MOR is the unexplained heterogeneity of early neonatal mortality between clusters, and it shows the odds of variation in early neonatal mortality between high- and low-risk clusters, taking two clusters at random. ICC indicates the percent of variation in early neonatal mortality between clusters, and PCV is the percent of variation in early neonatal mortality attributed to individual and community-level factors. The parameters MOR, ICC, and PCV were determined by the following equations: MOR = exp.(0.95√VC), ICC=VCvC+3.29×100% and PCV=VNull−VCVNull×100%, where; VC = variance of the cluster for respective model and Null = variance of the null model.

The measure of association or fixed effect was determined by the computation of the AOR at 95% CI and p-value. The best-fit model was selected by using deviance and log likelihood ratio (LLR). A model with a small value of deviance (-2×LLR) and a large value of log likelihood ratio was taken as the best fit.

Ethical consideration

The data for this study were extracted from the recent DHS dataset. The only prerequisite for access to the DHS data is registration. Therefore, receiving ethical approval for this study was not appropriate. More details regarding DHS data and ethical standards are available online at (http://www.dhsprogram.org.com).

Results

Socio-demographic characteristics of the study subjects

A total of 262,763 weighted live births were enrolled in the analysis of this study to determine the death of neonates within the first week of life in sub-Saharan Africa. The mean (±SD) age of mothers of babies who were study subjects was 29±7 years. Nearly three-fourths (75.29%) of babies were born to mothers in the age group of 20–35 years. One hundred twenty-four thousand and seven hundred sixty-two (47.48%) of the study subjects were from households of poor wealth status. About 70% of study subjects resided in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Out of the total live births included in the study, 112,021 (42.63%) were from the eastern part of Africa (Table 2).

Prevalence of early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa

Prevalence of early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa was found to be 22.94 deaths per 1000 live births at 95% CI (22.38, 23.5). Early neonatal mortality in urban and rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa was 22.32 and 23.21 deaths per 1000 live births (Fig 1).

Measure of variation and model fit statistics

As shown in Table 3 below, 10% of the variation in early neonatal mortality happened between clusters, and the rest of the variation occurred within clusters (ICC = 10%). The MOR in the null model shows that the odds of early neonatal mortality were 1.77 times higher among clusters of high risk for mortality compared to clusters of low risk for mortality. In model I, about 43% of the variation in early neonatal mortality was attributed to individual-level factors (PCV = 42.5%). In the final model, 67% of the variation in early neonatal mortality was due to both individual and community-level factors included in the regression. The odds of early neonatal mortality were 1.39 times higher among high-risk clusters compared to low-risk clusters (MOR = 1.39 in model III). According to the model fit statistics of this study, model III had the lowest deviance and a large LLR value, which indicated that it was the best fitted model.

The output result of the final model (Model III) of multilevel mixed effect logistic regression shows that maternal age, birth weight, number of ANC visits, mode of delivery, pregnancy complications, multiple pregnancy and community level poverty were significantly associated with early neonatal mortality (Table 4).

The odds of early neonatal mortality were 1.77 times higher for babies born to mothers in the age group of 36–49 (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.34–2.33) compared to babies born to mothers in the age group of 25–35. For low-birth-weight babies, the odds of early neonatal mortality were 3.27 times higher (AOR = 3.27, 95% CI: 2.16, 4.94) compared to those born with normal birth weight. The odds of death within the first week of life were 1.12 times higher for babies born to mothers who had less than four ANC visits during pregnancy (AOR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.33), taking babies born to mothers who had four and above ANC visits as a reference.

For babies delivered by caesarean section, the odds of early neonatal mortality were 1.81 (AOR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.30–2.5) times higher compared to babies delivered vaginally. In reference to babies born to mothers with complicated pregnancies, the odds of early neonatal mortality among babies born with no complications during pregnancy were reduced by 24% (AOR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.94). The odds of early neonatal mortality were 4.02 times higher (AOR = 4.02, 95% CI: 2.66, 6.08) for neonates born multiple compared to those born singleton. Taking babies born in communities with low levels of poverty as reference, the odds of early neonatal mortality were 1.32 (AOR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05–1.65) times higher among babies born in communities with high levels of poverty (Table 4).

Discussion

The death of neonates in the early stages of their lives is a global public health concern, especially in developing countries like sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from the recent demographic and health survey, this study determined the prevalence and associated factors of early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.

The prevalence of early neonatal mortality in this study was found to be 22.94 deaths per 1000 live births at a 95% CI (22.38, 23.5). This implies that the rate of early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa was about twofold higher than the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of 2030 to reduce the rate of neonatal mortality to 12 or less per 1000 live births [8].

On the one hand, the prevalence of early neonatal mortality in our study was lower than the prevalence in Nigeria, with 32 deaths per 1000 live births. This lower prevalence of early neonatal mortality than in the Nigerian study could be related to the DHS data used. Our study was conducted using DHS data from 2014 to 2020, whereas the study in Nigeria used DHS 2013. In this developing world, the rate of mortality among neonates decreases with time due to the advancement of technology and quality maternal and child health services. The more recent the DHS data is, the lower the rate of mortality could be.

On the other hand, the prevalence in this study was higher than the study in Afghanistan with prevalence of 14 deaths per 1000 live births [2]. This discrepancy between prevalence in our study and Afghanistan could be due to the variation in health infrastructure and socio-economic status across countries. In addition, according to 2018 United Nations estimates, Afghanistan has witnessed about a 50% and 62% reduction in maternal and child mortality from 1990 to 2017, respectively.

The multivariable multilevel mixed effect logistic regression analysis of this study revealed that maternal age, birth weight, ANC visit, multiple pregnancies, mode of delivery, pregnancy complications, and community level of poverty were significantly associated with early neonatal mortality.

The odds of early neonatal mortality were higher for babies born to mothers aged over 35 years compared to babies born to mothers in age group of 25–35 years. Previous studies have also reported the same [2, 20]. The significant association between early neonatal mortality and maternal age above 35 could be due to the fact that low-birth-weight and fetal macrosomia is more prevalent among baies born to mothers of advanced ages [20, 21].

Regarding birth weight, the odds of early neonatal death were higher among low-birth-weight babies compared to babies of normal birth weight. This is consistent with previous studies [21, 22]. One of the common reasons for higher odds of early neonatal mortality among low birth weight babies is that most of the time, low birth weight babies are preterm births and/or small for gestational age [21]. These findings suggest the need to improve mother care during pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal periods, particularly for low birth weight babies. The World Health Organisation has also developed clinical guidelines to increase baby survival and advocates the need for carefull essential newborn care for low-birth-weight babies [23]. Kangaroo mother care can be an option for neonatal care with low birth weights; it involves skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn [24].

The antenatal care visits during pregnancy of this birth was significantly associated with early neonatal mortality. The odds of death within the first week of life were higher for babies born to mothers who had less than four ANC visits during pregnancy, taking babies born to mothers who had four and above ANC visits as a reference group. It was evidenced that ANC service utilization only reduces mortality of neonates by an estimate of 10–20% [25, 26], although there is insufficient utilization of ANC services in sub-Saharan Africa [27]. A study conducted to determine the impact of ANC on neonatal mortality also found that "the utilisation of at least one antenatal care visit by a skilled provider during pregnancy reduces the risk of neonatal mortality by 39% in sub-Saharan African countries’ [28].

Surprisingly, this study found that cesarean section as a mode of delivery was significantly associated with early neonatal mortality. Though a cesarean section is performed to save the life of the newborn, the odds of early neonatal mortality were higher among babies delivered by cesarean section compared to babies delivered vaginally. This finding was coherent with the previous studies [29–31]. On this basis, previous scientific literature also recommends avoiding cesarean sections as intrapartum interventions when there is no clear medical indication that they will improve the outcome for the mother or the baby [30, 32, 33]. However, it could be plausible that the higher odds of early neonatal mortality among babies born via cesarean section were due to the fact that the majority of CS deliveries occur as a last option for delivery when there are pregnancy complications. The association between pregnancy complications and early neonatal mortality in our study supports this justification.

In this study, pregnancy comlication was another factor significantly associated with early neonatal mortality. In reference to babies born to mothers with complicated pregnancies, the odds of early neonatal mortality among babies born with no complications during pregnancy were reduced by 24%. This finding was supported by previous studies [34, 35]. Hence, prevention and carefully tackling complications that happen during pregnancy could be essential strategies to reduce mortality in newborns.

Furthermore, multiple pregnancy was significanly associated with early neonatal mortality. The odds of early neonatal mortality was four times higher for neonates born multiple compared to those born singleton. This finding agrees with previous study [36]. It could be logical explanation that babies born from multiple pregnancies typically suffer growth constraints, low Apgar scores, and very low birth weights [37, 38]. Moreover, multiple pregnancies are more likely to be complicated during pregnancy, labor and after delivery [38].

Eventually, community poverty level was significantly associated with early neonatal mortality. Accordingly, the odds of early neonatal mortality increased by 32 percent among babies born in communities with high levels of poverty, taking babies born in communities with low levels of poverty as a reference group. This finding was supported by previous evidence [39–41]. Babies who die in early neonatal life suffer from conditions and diseases associated with a lack of quality care at or immediately after birth and in the first week of life [42]. Poverty can exacerbate these issues by limiting access to quality healthcare, nutrition, and sanitation, which can increase the risk of neonatal mortality [42].

The use of nationally collected large samples of recent demographic and health survey data from sub-Saharan African countries and the application of an appropriate advanced multilevel mixed effect model were the strengths of this study. However, a few sub-Saharan African countries that had not had a demographic or health survey since 2014 were not included, which may have affected the generalizability of our finding. In addition, the study used DHS data collected in different years, which might have exposed the findings of the study to the differential time effect.

Conclusion

This study found that about twenty-three neonates out of one thousand live births died within the first week of life in sub-Saharan Africa. The age of mothers, birth weight, antenatal care service utilization, mode of delivery, multiple pregnancy, complications during pregnancy, and community poverty should be considered while designing policies and strategies targeting early neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.

Reviewer #1: The work is technically sound though the following need to be addressed;

Methods

• Use of Kids Records is not the most appropriate word to use unless it was officially called that as in statement below;

This study used the Kids Records (KR) dataset to determine the outcome variable.

The two statements are contradictory, address the discrepancy;

• A sample of 262,763 live births were included in the study (Table 1).

Table 1: Sample size for early neonatal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa countries (n=352,605).

• Be consistent use either subject or participants.

3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?

There is need to provide more detailed information about the inclusion criteria

• Describe the inclusion criteria in this study and how you deal with missing data which a common problem with secondary data

• Paragraph your work well

• Work on spacing between the reference and the words before

• Ensure that the font size is the same throught the document see the paragraph below

In this study, pregnancy complication was another factor significantly associated with early neonatal mortality. In reference to babies born to mothers with complicated pregnancies, the odds of early neonatal mortality among babies born with no complications during pregnancy were reduced by 24%. This finding was supported by previous studies (29, 30)

Introduction

• Number the lines so that they are easy to refer to

• Be specific for example when you stated in the introduction that;

• Before turning five, 3.3 million more children will die(4). Specify what measurement five is … days, months..years etc

• Please talk of SDG because these are the ones currently being referred to ..

• There many grammatically errors

• Provide references for the paragraph below;

• The early neonatal period, the first seven days of life, are the most precarious for a baby's survival. Children face the highest risk of death in their first week of life, especially in low- and middle income countries.

• Provide references to qualify the paragraph below;

Since neonatal mortality in the first week of life is understudied in sub-Saharan

Africa, coming up with its magnitude and determinants helps understand the current status of

Results

• Leave space between the narratives before the tables and the tables

• Spelling of maternal education in table 4

• Table 4 should reflect the outcome as in two by two format. Ie outcome vs independent variables under the different models

Reviewer #2: The authors have chosen an important public health problem for their study. The evidence from the study will add to the knowledge base which will have contribution to policy makers and program implementers working to reduce neonatal mortality. Here below, please find my review comments:

Abstract

• Please report the specific category within a variable that is a risk factor than mentioning the entire variable as a risk factor E.g. ANC visits, mode of delivery etc.

Introduction:

• ‘’The neonatal period (the first 28 days of life) accounted for more than 44 percent of the estimated 6.3 million child fatalities worldwide in 2032, while the early neonatal period accounted for 75% of these neonatal deaths’’. Please make sure you use the right tense in the above sentence. A 2032 newborn mortality is a prediction. It is better if you can describe the current burden of neonatal mortality and its contribution.

• It is better to bring up the definition of early neonatal mortality upfront to understand your paper well

• ‘’In Africa, 1.16 million babies perish within the first month of life; half of them die on their very first day. Before turning five, 3.3 million more children will die (4)’’. From this statement, one can calculate the contribution of neonatal mortality in Africa which is roughly 35% of the under-five deaths in the continent. This is far below the 44% contribution for the 2032 worldwide prediction. The truth is, despite still unacceptable magnitude, neonatal mortality is on a declining trend worldwide. This also again contradicts with the contribution of neonatal mortality to under five mortalities mentioned in the follow on paragraph (40.3). Please double check the credibility of your sources and the accuracy of your references.

• In the following sentences the authors talk a lot about MDG while it is a long gone target replaced by the sustainable development goal (SDG). Better to mention the targets and progress of the SDG about neonatal mortality.

Methods

• Please put the countries in Table 1 in alphabetical order (E.g. Chad)

• Aggregating individual level variables to use them as group level variables will cause atomistic fallacy. One of the advantage of using mixed effects modeling is to avoid both ecological and atomistic fallacies. Using group level variables as individual variables and vice versa will cause fallacies. Hence, I suggest you treat maternal education and wealth index at their proper level.

• In the calculation of the prevalence of early neonatal mortality, you need to use weighting. It needs to be also described in the analysis section.

Result

• When you report measures of central tendency please report them as for example mean (+SD) followed by the actual numbers.

• Mode of Delivery in Table 2 is stated as ‘Yes’’ and ‘’No’’ compared to Table 4 (CS Vs vaginal). What do ‘’Yes’’ and ‘’No’’ categories in Table 2 stand for?

Discussion

• In the discussion part, it is good to compare apples with apples. The mortality prevalence is a result for SSA and the comparison is better made with similar sub-continent levels than a single country.

• You reported ‘’ The number of antenatal care visits during pregnancy of this birth was significantly associated with early neonatal mortality’’. However, your data was categorical. I think you need to correct the statement.

• The risk of neonatal mortality is high among babies born using CS. What is the implication of more deaths in CS than vaginal deliveries? Can it be related to the quality of CS service? How can CS meant to save the lives of the mother and the child cause more deaths? Could this be related to the fact that already troubled pregnancy undergo CS? Can you compare this result with other studies? You have described it somehow, but needs more elaboration.

General comment

• Please spell out acronyms the first time they appear in the body text. (E.g. MDG, MOR, ICC, PCV, R etc). Plus there are a lot of language errors and words that are misspelt. Please review accordingly.

• You need to edit the language and the flow of ideas very well.

Reviewer #2: The authors have chosen an important public health problem for their study. The evidence from the study will add to the knowledge base which will have contribution to policy makers and program implementers working to reduce neonatal mortality.

Abstract

• Please report the specific category within a variable that is a risk factor than mentioning the entire variable as a risk factor E.g. ANC visits, mode of delivery etc.

Introduction:

• ‘’The neonatal period (the first 28 days of life) accounted for more than 44 percent of the estimated 6.3 million child fatalities worldwide in 2032, while the early neonatal period accounted for 75% of these neonatal deaths’’.

Response: Dear reviewer, thank you for your constructive comment. The comment is now addressed. Kindly find the point in our updated document.

Methods

• Please put the countries in Table 1 in alphabetical order (E.g. Chad)

Response: Dear reviewer, thank you for your constructive feedback. The countries are now ordered alphabetically.

• Aggregating individual level variables to use them as group level variables will cause atomistic fallacy. One of the advantage of using mixed effects modeling is to avoid both ecological and atomistic fallacies. Using group level variables as individual variables and vice versa will cause fallacies. Hence, I suggest you treat maternal education and wealth index at their proper level.

Response: Dear reviewer, thank you for such a constructive view of expertise. We just aggregated wealth index and maternal education by considering that the mixed effect model could control for the fallacies. Originally, the authors used this technique by looking previous literatures. Taking your comments into account, now on the authors will treat individual and group variables at their proper level. Thank you.

• In the calculation of the prevalence of early neonatal mortality, you need to use weighting. It needs to be also described in the analysis section.

Response: Dear reviewer, Thank you for the concern. The computation of an outcome in DHS should always be supported by appropriate weighting. Though the prevalence of early neonatal mortality reported in our manuscript was weighted, we missed describing it in the method section. Taking your comment into consideration, we have now mentioned the point in our updated work. Kindly see the point in our revised manuscript.

Result

• When you report measures of central tendency please report them as for example mean (+SD) followed by the actual numbers.

Response: Dear reviewer, thank you for your guiding comments. We addressed it as per your direction.

• Mode of Delivery in Table 2 is stated as ‘Yes’’ and ‘’No’’ compared to Table 4 (CS Vs vaginal). What do ‘’Yes’’ and ‘’No’’ categories in Table 2 stand for?

Response: Dear reviewer, Thank you for your invaluable scientific guidance. ’Yes’’ and ‘’No’’ categories in Table 2 stand for CS and not CS (Vaginal) modes of delivery, respectively. Sorry for the discrepancy. We addressed the discrepancy in our revised manuscript.

Discussion

• In the discussion part, it is good to compare apples with apples. The mortality prevalence is a result for SSA and the comparison is better made with similar sub-continent levels than a single country.

Response: Dear reviewer, Thank you for your insightful feedback on our discussion. You are correct; general studies should be discussed with similar kinds of studies instead of pocket ones. We made some amendments to the section as per your comment, using information available to the best of our search. We discussed our prevalence with prevalence from similar kinds of data (DHS), though some are not intercontinental. We faced the challenge of a lack of studies with similar aims at similar levels. Thank you!

• You reported ‘’ The number of antenatal care visits during pregnancy of this birth was significantly associated with early neonatal mortality’’. However, your data was categorical. I think you need to correct the statement.

Response: Thank you, the concern is addressed accordingly.

• The risk of neonatal mortality is high among babies born using CS. What is the implication of more deaths in CS than vaginal deliveries? Can it be related to the quality of CS service? How can CS meant to save the lives of the mother and the child cause more deaths? Could this be related to the fact that already troubled pregnancy undergo CS? Can you compare this result with other studies? You have described it somehow, but needs more elaboration.

Response: Dear reviewer, thank you for such a scientifically valuable comment. We made modifications to the section by including additional justifications. Kindly find the point in our revised manuscript.

General comment

• Please spell out acronyms the first time they appear in the body text. (E.g. MDG, MOR, ICC, PCV, R etc). Plus there are a lot of language errors and words that are misspelt. Please review accordingly.

Response: Dear reviewer, we spelled out all the acronyms the first time they appear in the text throughout the manuscript and mentioned them in the abbreviation section of your manuscript. Kindly see the point in our revised manuscript.

• You need to edit the language and the flow of ideas very well.

Response: Dear reviewer, we thoroughly checked the language and made rigorous modifications to the errors as per necessary.

Once again, we thank you for your insightful comments, suggestions, and guidance, which have significantly improved the study.
