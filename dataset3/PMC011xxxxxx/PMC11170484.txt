Abstract

Objectives

We performed a multicentre study (2020–2022) to compare the in vitro activity of ozenoxacin and comparator agents against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes clinical isolates from skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI).

Methods

A total of 1725 isolates (1454 S. aureus and 271 S. pyogenes) were collected in 10 centres from eight countries between January 2020 and December 2022. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined (microdilution-SENSITITRE). Results were interpreted following European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2023 (clinical breakpoints, ECOFF) and CLSI criteria.

Results

Ozenoxacin exhibited high in vitro activity against S. aureus (MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.12 mg/L) and S. pyogenes (MIC50/90 = 0.015/0.03 mg/L), inhibiting 99% of the isolates at MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L and at MIC ≤ 0.06, respectively. The most active comparators against S. aureus were retapamulin (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), fusidic acid (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/L) and mupirocin (MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L); and against S. pyogenes were retapamulin (MIC90 = 0.03 mg/L), clindamycin (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and mupirocin (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/L). Ciprofloxacin and methicillin resistant rates for S. aureus were 31.3% (455/1454) and 41% (598/1454), respectively. Additionally, 62% (373/598) of the MRSA were also ciprofloxacin non-susceptible, whereas only 10% (23/271) of the MSSA were ciprofloxacin resistant. Ozenoxacin was more active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible S. aureus than against ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates, and showed a slightly higher MIC in MRSA isolates than in MSSA. However, ozenoxacin activity was comparable in both ciprofloxacin-resistant MSSA and MRSA subsets. On the other hand, ozenoxacin had similar activity in ciprofloxacin-susceptible and resistant S. pyogenes isolates.

Conclusions

Ozenoxacin is a potent antimicrobial agent of topic use against Gram-positive bacteria causing SSTI, including MRSA isolates non-susceptible to ciprofloxacin.

Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are major causative bacteria responsible for skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) such as impetigo.1,2 Clinical guidelines recommend the use of topical antibacterial agents for localized impetigo, reserving oral or even intravenous antibiotics for those cases involving extensive lesions resistant to topical therapy, systemic infections and the management of outbreaks.3 Mupirocin, fusidic acid and more recently retapamulin, are the topical antimicrobials more frequently used to treat impetigo in clinical practice.4–6 However, antimicrobial resistance to these topical compounds has been reported, possibly due to the increasing incidence of community-acquired MRSA infections, posing a further limitation to the overall efficacy of available antibiotics.7–11

Ozenoxacin is a novel non-fluorinated quinolone antibacterial that was approved in 2017 in the EU, Canada and the USA for the topical treatment of impetigo in patients ≥2 months of age.12–14 Ozenoxacin has showed excellent in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria causing SSTIs, including S. aureus and S. pyogenes clinical isolates.12,15–17 Previous studies demonstrated higher efficacy of ozenoxacin compared to other topical antibacterial agents, especially in cases involving quinolones-resistant MRSA isolates.16–18

Surveillance studies of antimicrobial resistance are necessary for monitoring changes in resistance rates, detecting the emergence and spread of new resistances, assessing the scale of the resistance problem at a local, national or international level, and providing data for selection of empirical therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of ozenoxacin and comparator agents against the most prevalent bacterial pathogens that concern SSTI (S. aureus and S. pyogenes) prospectively collected in eight countries from patients with impetigo or community-acquired skin infections between 2020 and 2022.

Methods

Study design and bacterial isolates

A multicentre study was designed to assess the in vitro activity of ozenoxacin and comparator agents against Gram-positive clinical isolates prospectively recovered in 10 centres from eight countries [Spain (n = 2), Canada (n = 2), Brazil (n = 1), Colombia (n = 1), Germany (n = 1), Italy (n = 1), UK (n = 1), USA (n = 1)] between January 2020 and December 2022. A total of 1725 isolates [S. aureus (n = 1454) and S. pyogenes (n = 271)] were recovered from paediatric and adult patients with uncomplicated (uSSTIs) and/or complicated SSTI (cSSTIs), including impetigo. Centres were asked to collect up to 50 S. aureus (25 MSSA and 25 MRSA) and 20 S. pyogenes. Overall, 650 isolates were collected from eight centres in 2020, 573 isolates from nine centres in 2021 and 502 isolates from seven centres in 2022. Only one isolate per patient was included. All isolates were sent to the coordinator laboratory (Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Madrid, Spain) for further microbiological studies. Distribution of isolates by microorganism and year of collection is summarized in Table S1 (available as Supplementary data at JAC-AMR Online). Species identification was carried out at each participant hospital and confirmed at the coordinating laboratory using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The ethics committee of the coordinating centre approved the study (ref. 336-19).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Susceptibility of ozenoxacin and comparators was determined by broth microdilution using Trek (Thermo Fisher Scientific, East Grinstead, West Sussex, UK) 96-well panels. MIC50 and MIC90 values were also calculated for each antimicrobial agent. The tested antimicrobial concentration ranges were as follows: penicillin, 0.03–0.5 mg/L; ozenoxacin, 0.001–4 mg/L; ciprofloxacin, 0.06–16 mg/L; levofloxacin; 0.06–16 mg/L; mupirocin, 0.06–256 mg/L; fusidic acid, 0.03–16 mg/L; vancomycin, 0.25–2 mg/L; erythromycin, 0.06–16 mg/L; clindamycin, 0.015–16 mg/L and retapamulin, 0.015–2 mg/L. In addition, cefoxitin as marker for mecA-mediated methicillin resistance (in a single concentration, 4 mg/L) was included in the panel following the recommendations of the CLSI. S. aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 43300 were used for quality control.19 The results were interpreted in accordance with the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (EUCAST-2023, https://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints) and CLSI (CLSI-2020, https://clsi.org/standards/products/microbiology/documents/m100/) guidelines.19,20 No breakpoints are yet defined by the CLSI or EUCAST for ozenoxacin. For retapamulin, EUCAST epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) values were used.

Results

Bacterial isolates

A total of 1454 S. aureus (84.3%) and 271 S. pyogenes (15.7%) isolates were recovered from 209 paediatric (12.1% ≤ 18 years, range: 5 days–18 years) and 1481 adult (85.9% > 18 years, range: 18–101 years) patients. Demographic information was not available for 35 patients. All patients had community-acquired skin infections [S. aureus (n = 1072, 62.1%) and S. pyogenes (n = 208, 12.1%)], including impetigo [S. aureus (n = 19, 1.1%) and S. pyogenes (n = 5, 0.3%)] or other skin infections [S. aureus (n = 363, 21.0%) and S. pyogenes (n = 58, 3.4%)]. Isolates were recovered from wounds (n = 708, 41.0%), abscesses (n = 324, 18.8%), skin (n = 353, 20.5%), soft tissues (n = 205, 11.9%) and not specified skin and soft-tissue samples (n = 135, 7.8%). Distribution of species by type of infection and sample source is summarized in Table S2.

Of the 1454 S. aureus isolates included in the study, 598 (41.1%) were MRSA and 856 (58.9%) were MSSA. According to the EUCAST criteria, more than a half (62.4%, 373/598) of the MRSA were also ciprofloxacin non-susceptible, whereas only 9.6% (82/856) of the MSSA were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Among the S. pyogenes isolates, 8.5% (23/271) were resistant to ciprofloxacin.

Ozenoxacin in vitro activity in S. aureus

Ozenoxacin demonstrated excellent overall activity (MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.12 mg/L, range ≤0.001–>4 mg/L) against all 1454 S. aureus isolates, inhibiting 98.6% at a MIC of ≤0.5 mg/L. The susceptibility of comparator agents according to EUCAST was as follows: vancomycin, 99.7%; retapamulin, 99.2%; mupirocin, 94.6%; fusidic acid, 93.3%; clindamycin, 89.2% and erythromycin, 53.8% (Table 1). Overall, changes were not observed in the ozenoxacin MIC values over time: MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.12 mg/L, range ≤0.001–2 mg/L, during 2020; MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.12 mg/L, range ≤0.001–2 mg/L, during 2021 and MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.06 mg/L, range ≤0.001–>4 mg/L, during 2022 (Table 2, Figure 1). Summary MIC data and interpretative susceptibility results for ozenoxacin against all S. aureus by methicillin and ciprofloxacin susceptibilities during the 3 years of study are shown in Table 2.

MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus; MSSA, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Ciprofloxacin MIC values were interpreted as susceptible (S ≤ 0.001 mg/L; I = 0.001–1 mg/L) and resistant (R > 1 mg/L) (EUCAST-2023).

No breakpoints are yet defined by the CLSI or EUCAST for ozenoxacin.

MIC50/90, range and % of inhibition was only calculated in the subsets with a minimum of 10 isolates.

MIC values of comparators were interpreted as resistant as follows: mupirocin (S. aureus, MIC > 1 mg/L; S. pyogenes, MIC > 0.5 mg/L), fusidic acid (S. aureus, MIC > 1 mg/L; S. pyogenes, MIC > 16 mg/L) and retapamulin (S. aureus, MIC > 0.5 mg/L; S. pyogenes, MIC > 0.125 mg/L).

CIP-R, ciprofloxacin resistant; CIP-S, ciprofloxacin susceptible; MUP-R, mupirocin resistant; FUS-R, fusidic acid resistant; RET-R, retapamulin resistant

aFor S. aureus, ciprofloxacin MIC values were interpreted as susceptible (S ≤ 0.001 mg/L; I = 0.001–1 mg/L) and resistant (R > 1 mg/L) according to the clinical breakpoints (EUCAST-2023).

bFor S. pyogenes, ciprofloxacin MIC values were interpreted as susceptible (S ≤ 1 mg/L) and resistant (R > 1 mg/L) according to the epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) value (EUCAST-2023).

cPercentage of inhibition at MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L in S. aureus and at MIC ≤0.06 mg/L in S. pyogenes.

Overall, ozenoxacin was the most potent agent. MIC50 value of ozenoxacin (MIC50 = 0.002 mg/L) was 5-fold serial dilution lower than that of retapamulin (MIC50 = 0.06 mg/L), 6-fold dilution greater than that of clindamycin and fusidic acid (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L), 7-fold dilution greater than that of mupirocin, erythromycin and levofloxacin (MIC50 = 0.25 mg/L) and 8-fold dilution greater than that of ciprofloxacin (MIC50 = 0.5 mg/L). At the MIC90 level, ozenoxacin (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), was 1-fold dilution more active than fusidic acid (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/L), 2-fold dilution more active than mupirocin (MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L), 5-fold dilution more potent than clindamycin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L) and at least 7-fold dilution more active than erythromycin, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (MIC90 ≥ 16 mg/L for all) (Table 1).

The activity of ozenoxacin was higher against ciprofloxacin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.004 mg/L, range ≤0.001–0.5 mg/L) (100% MIC ≤0.5 mg/L) compared with that against ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.12 mg/L, range ≤0.001–>4 mg/L) (95.4% MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L). Ozenoxacin was the most active compound against ciprofloxacin resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC50 = 0.06 mg/L; MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) along with retapamulin (MIC50 = 0.06 mg/L, MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L). MIC50 value of ozenoxacin was 1-fold dilution greater than that of clindamycin and fusidic acid (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L) and 2-fold dilution more potent than mupirocin (MIC50 = 0.25 mg/L). Comparative MIC90 data showed that the activity of ozenoxacin (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) was slightly higher than that of fusidic acid (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/L), but at least 7-fold dilution more active than mupirocin and clindamycin (MIC90 ≥ 16 mg/L). The remaining agents had higher MIC50 and MIC90 values than ozenoxacin (Table 1).

MRSA (n = 598) had slightly raised MIC compared to ozenoxacin (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.12 mg/L, range ≤0.001–2 mg/L) than MSSA (n = 856) isolates (MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.004 mg/L, range ≤0.001–>4 mg/L). On the other hand, MRSA that was also ciprofloxacin resistant (n = 373) had an MIC50/90 of 0.06/0.25 mg/L (range 0.002–2 mg/L), slightly higher than that obtained in MSSA isolates that were ciprofloxacin resistant (n = 82) (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.12 mg/L, range ≤0.001–>4 mg/L). Up to 99.6% of MSSA isolates showed an ozenoxacin MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L, whereas 97.0% of MRSA were inhibited at a MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L. Percentages of inhibition of ozenoxacin at a MIC ≤0.5 mg/L in ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA and ciprofloxacin-resistant MSSA isolates were 95.2% and 96.3%, respectively (Table 2). Among the comparators, only retapamulin (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.12 mg/L) and fusidic acid (MIC50/90 = 0.12/0.25 mg/L) showed comparable activity to that of ozenoxacin (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.25 mg/L) in the subset of ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA isolates. Resistance rates of mupirocin, fusidic acid and retapamulin in the subset of MRSA strains were 9.2%, 10.4% and 1.3%, respectively. The activity of the remaining agents is shown in Table S3.

Ozenoxacin in vitro activity in S. pyogenes

According to both EUCAST and CLSI criteria, all S. pyogenes isolates (n = 271) were susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin and fusidic acid. Susceptibility rates of other antimicrobials according to EUCAST were as follows: retapamulin, 99.6%; levofloxacin, 98.5%; mupirocin, 96.3%; clindamycin, 95.9%; ciprofloxacin, 91.5% and erythromycin, 84.5%) (Table 3). A small increase in the ozenoxacin MIC50/90 values was observed over time: 2020, MIC50/90 = 0.008/0.015 mg/L, 99.2% MIC ≤ 0.06 mg/L; 2021, MIC50/90 = 0.015/0.03, 96.9% MIC ≤ 0.06 mg/L and 2022, MIC50/90 = 0.015/0.06 mg/L, 96.5% MIC ≤ 0.06 mg/L. Moreover, a higher number of isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin was also detected in 2022 (17/23) compared to the previous 2 years [2020 (3/23) and 2021 (3/23)] (Table 2, Figure 2).

Ciprofloxacin MIC values were interpreted as susceptible (S ≤ 1 mg/L) and resistant (R > 1 mg/L) according to the epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) value (EUCAST-2023).

No breakpoints are yet defined by the CLSI or EUCAST for ozenoxacin.

aMIC results were interpreted following the ECOFF values of EUCAST.

At the MIC50 level, ozenoxacin demonstrated potent activity against all S. pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.015 mg/L). MIC50 values for the other comparators tested were: retapamulin, MIC50 ≤ 0.015 mg/L; clindamycin, MIC50 = 0.03 mg/L; erythromycin, MIC50 ≤ 0.06 mg/L; mupirocin, MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L; vancomycin, MIC50 ≤ 0.25 mg/L; ciprofloxacin, MIC50 = 0.5 mg/L; levofloxacin, MIC50 = 0.5 mg/L and fusidic acid, MIC50 = 2 mg/L. Comparative MIC data showed that ozenoxacin activity (MIC90 = 0.03 mg/L) was equal to that of retapamulin (MIC90 = 0.03 mg/L). Nevertheless, ozenoxacin was 2-fold dilution more active than clindamycin (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L); 3-fold dilution more active than mupirocin (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/L); 5-fold dilution more active than vancomycin (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/L) and levofloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), and 7-fold dilution more active than erythromycin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L) and fusidic acid (MIC90 = 4 mg/L) (Table 3).

In the subset of ciprofloxacin resistant S. pyogenes isolates (n = 23), susceptibility rates by EUCAST were: penicillin, 100%; vancomycin, 100%; fusidic acid, 100%; retapamulin, 100%; clindamycin, 78.3%; mupirocin, 95.7% and erythromycin, 65.2%. Ozenoxacin also showed the highest activity (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.06 mg/L, range 0.008–0.12 mg/L) along with retapamulin (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.06 mg/L, range 0.008–0.12 mg/L). At MIC50 level, ozenoxacin (MIC50 = 0.06 mg/L) was comparable to erythromycin (MIC50 ≤ 0.06 mg/L) and clindamycin (MIC50 ≤ 0.03 mg/L), but was 2-fold dilutions more potent than mupirocin (MIC50 = 0.25 mg/L), 3-fold dilutions more active than vancomycin (MIC50 = 0.5 mg/L) and 6-fold dilutions more active than fusidic acid (MIC50 = 4 mg/L). At MIC90 level, ozenoxacin (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) was 1-fold dilution more active than clindamycin (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), 3-fold dilution more active than mupirocin (MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L), 4-fold dilution more active than vancomycin (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), 7-fold dilution more active than fusidic acid (MIC90 = 8 mg/L) and at least 9-fold dilution more potent than erythrodmycin (MIC90 > 16 mg/L) (Table 3).

Discussion

In the present study, we compared the in vitro activity of ozenoxacin against recent clinical isolates (2020–2022) of MSSA, MRSA and S. pyogenes, including both quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant isolates, with that of topical agents most frequently used for the treatment of superficial skin infections, including impetigo. S. aureus was the most frequent microorganism in our collection (85%), most of them from infection samples of community origin. Up to 41% of the S. aureus were resistant to methicillin and more than a half of them were also resistant to ciprofloxacin (62% of MRSA).

Confirming the results of previously published comparative studies, ozenoxacin exhibited potent in vitro activity against both S. aureus (MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.12 mg/L) and S. pyogenes (MIC50/90 = 0.015/0.03 mg/L), inhibiting 99% of the isolates at MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L and at MIC ≤ 0.06, respectively.12,16,17 A previous multicentre study comparing two collections of Gram-positive clinical samples from 2009–2010 and 2014 showed similar ozenoxacin MIC values in both S. aureus (MIC50/90 = 0.004/0.25 mg/L in 2009–2010; MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.06 mg/L in 2014) and S. pyogenes (MIC50/90 = 0.03/0.06 mg/L in 2009–2010; MIC50/90 = 0.008/0.015 mg/L in 2014).16 Also in agreement with these studies, the more active comparator agent against S. aureus isolates was retapamulin (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), followed by fusidic acid (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/L) and mupirocin (MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L). Other agents with activity against S. pyogenes were retapamulin (MIC90 =0.03 mg/L), clindamycin (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and mupirocin (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/L). These isolates also showed susceptible but with increased MIC90 values (MIC90 = 4 mg/L) of fusidic acid. Note that we observed a small increase over time in the ozenoxacin MIC50/90 values of S. pyogenes (from 0.008/0.015 mg/L in 2020 to 0.015/0.06 mg/L in 2022), possibly due to the increase of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates in the last year.

As in previous studies, ozenoxacin maintained robust activity against all isolates, regardless of ciprofloxacin susceptibility.12,16–18 However, coinciding with these studies, compared with that observed in S. aureus isolates susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.004 mg/L), ozenoxacin had lower activity when tested against S. aureus resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.12 mg/L). In S. pyogenes, ozenoxacin also showed higher activity against ciprofloxacin susceptible (MIC50/90 = 0.008/0.06 mg/L) than against ciprofloxacin resistant (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.06 mg/L) isolates. Nevertheless, in both species the activity of ozenoxacin remained superior to that of the comparator agents against ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates and only retapamulin showed MIC90 values equal to those of ozenoxacin. Several studies have demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity of ozenoxacin against Gram-positive bacteria resistant to other quinolones, including strains carrying mutations in gyrA and/or parC genes, and low capacity to select resistant mutant strains.18,21 This could be explained by the different mechanisms of action of these agents. Ciprofloxacin acts preferentially against topoisomerase IV, whereas ozenoxacin has been shown to simultaneously inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV at lower concentrations compared to other quinolones.12 Moreover, the efficacy of ozenoxacin is not affected in strains with active efflux systems, providing an advantage over other related agents.12,13

On the other hand, ozenoxacin was the most potent antimicrobial agent tested overall against MSSA isolates (MIC50/90 = 0.002/0.004 mg/L). As in previous studies, MRSA isolates had slightly increased MICs to ozenoxacin (MIC50/90 = 0.06/0.12 mg/L).12,16,17 This is probably due to a slight decrease in interaction with topoisomerases (cross-resistance) rather than methicillin-susceptibility; MRSA with susceptible ciprofloxacin MIC values displayed an ozenoxacin MIC90 of 0.004 mg/L. In fact, ozenoxacin exhibited higher activity than all comparator agents against MSSA isolates, while in the subsets of MRSA and ciprofloxacin resistance, activity of ozenoxacin was comparable to that of retapamulin and fusidic acid, and higher than that of the other compounds.

According to previous data, resistance to both mupirocin and fusidic acid has been documented in Europe and is increasing, particularly in community-associated MRSA infections.8,10,11 In addition, a low-level of resistance to retapamulin has also been described.7,9 In our MRSA collection, we found higher resistance rates to mupirocin (9%), fusidic acid (10%) and retapamulin (1.3%) than a previous study performed in China in 2020 (5%, 1% and 0.3%, respectively). These data underscore the need for alternative solutions and raise ozenoxacin as a valuable and safe alternative for the treatment of SSTIs, including impetigo. In this sense, a recent study in Canada showed an excellent activity of ozenoxacin against MSSA and MRSA isolates with high-level of resistance to mupirocin and fusidic acid.17 Note that both mupirocin and fusidic acid are bacteriostatic antibiotics while ozenoxacin shows a bactericidal activity.

The main limitation of our study is the absence of established breakpoints for ozenoxacin by both CLSI and EUCAST. Clinical breakpoints are not determined for topical antibiotics as PK/PD targets are not also defined. This underscores the need for continued surveillance and analysis of MIC distributions.

In conclusion, our study provides a temporal perspective of ozenoxacin susceptibility, revealing stability in MIC values over the 3 years of study. Our results highlight the consistent and potent activity of ozenoxacin against S. aureus, irrespective of their methicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance status. This potent activity was also observed in S. pyogenes, even when exhibiting ciprofloxacin resistance. Notably, ozenoxacin demonstrated superiority over comparator agents, including in the subset of ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA isolates. Ongoing monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is crucial for informed decision making in empirical therapy, especially in the ever-evolving landscape of bacterial resistance patterns.
