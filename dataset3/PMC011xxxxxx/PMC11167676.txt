Abstract

Aims

Human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived atrial cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-aCM) could be a helpful tool to study the physiology and diseases of the human atrium. To fulfil this expectation, the electrophysiology of hiPSC-aCM should closely resemble the situation in the human atrium. Data on the contribution of the slowly activating delayed rectifier currents (IKs) to repolarization are lacking for both human atrium and hiPSC-aCM.

Methods and results

Human atrial tissues were obtained from patients with sinus rhythm (SR) or atrial fibrillation (AF). Currents were measured in human atrial cardiomyocytes (aCM) and compared with hiPSC-aCM and used to model IKs contribution to action potential (AP) shape. Action potential was recorded by sharp microelectrodes. HMR-1556 (1 µM) was used to identify IKs and to estimate IKs contribution to repolarization. Less than 50% of hiPSC-aCM and aCM possessed IKs. Frequency of occurrence, current densities, activation/deactivation kinetics, and voltage dependency of IKs did not differ significantly between hiPSC-aCM and aCM, neither in SR nor AF. β-Adrenoceptor stimulation with isoprenaline did not increase IKs neither in aCM nor in hiPSC-aCM. In tissue from SR, block of IKs with HMR-1556 did not lengthen the action potential duration, even when repolarization reserve was reduced by block of the ultra-rapid repolarizing current with 4-aminopyridine or the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium outward current with E-4031.

Conclusion

I Ks exists in hiPSC-aCM with biophysics not different from aCM. As in adult human atrium (SR and AF), IKs does not appear to relevantly contribute to repolarization in hiPSC-aCM.

Atrial human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived atrial cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) possess IKs.

Biophysics of IKs in atrial hiPSC-CM closely resembles the situation in the human atrium.

Action potential shape in the human atrium and in hiPSC-aCM does not favour relevant contribution of IKs.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a challenge.1,2 The electrophysiological characteristics of chronically remodelled atria (several months) have been studied in several in vitro studies using human tissues collected during open-heart surgery. Early adaptation to rapid activation of the atria (within hours or a few days) cannot be addressed by measuring action potential (AP) from patients that were mostly in AF for more than 6 months. Furthermore, AF is strongly associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), but the functional relevance of the SNPs is poorly understood. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived atrial cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-aCM)3–5 are expected to add substantially to both fields.6,7 However, the value of hiPSC-aCM for studying human atrial electrophysiology will critically depend on how closely hiPSC-aCM resemble the electrophysiological properties of human SR atrium cardiomyocytes.

Supplementation of cardiac differentiation protocols with retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to induce an atrial phenotype in hiPSC-CM.3,4 Recently, we showed that the concentration of RA is critical to induce a fully human atrium–like AP shape in hiPSC-aCM, characterized by strong contribution of two atrial-selective potassium currents: the ultra-rapid activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKur) and the acetylcholine-activated inward rectifier potassium current (IK, Ach).8 However, the contribution of repolarizing potassium currents non-selectively expressed in atrium and ventricle may also be relevant in hiPSC-aCM. Among these currents, the slowly activating delayed rectifier current (IKs) is of special interest, since its contribution to repolarization is unknown not only in hiPSC-aCM but also in the human atrium.9 Therefore, we have measured IKs currents in human atrial cardiomyocyte (aCM) and in hiPSC-aCM. We used an in silico model to identify conditions where IKs could contribute to repolarization in the human atrium. The findings were validated by AP measurements in intact atrial tissue and atrial engineered heart tissue (aEHT).

Methods

Human adult atrial tissue

Heart tissue from right atrial appendages was obtained with informed consent from 53 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the Department of Heart Surgery, Dresden University of Technology. Work with human tissue was approved by the Medical Faculty Ethics Committee of Dresden University of Technology (document EK790799). Patch clamp experiments in human atrial cardiomyocytes and AP recordings in intact human atrial tissue were performed at the Department of Experimental Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical Faculty, Dresden University of Technology, between 2004 and 2011. While patch clamp data were not used before from human atrial cardiomyocytes, basal AP data (before adding potassium channel blockers) were used for a larger retrospective analysis focusing on impact of sex and age on AP characteristics.10 Patients in AF were older than in SR, and ejection fraction was not reduced in both groups (57 and 51% in SR and AF, respectively). The majority of patients was treated with β-blockers, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (for details, see Table 1).

Human atrial cardiomyocytes (aCMs) were isolated and prepared as previously described.11 In brief, the tissues were cut into small pieces in Ca2+-free isolation buffer of the following composition (in millimolar): NaCl 100, KCl 10, KH2PO4 1.2, MgSO4 5, MOPS 5, glucose 20, and taurine 50 (pH 7.0). The buffer contained 30 mM butanedione monoxime (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). During the entire isolation procedure, the solutions were oxygenated with 100% O2 at 37°C. Human aCMs were dissociated with protease type XXIV (5 U/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and collagenase type 1 (254 U/mL; Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ, USA) for 15–35 min. Thereafter, the suspension was centrifuged at 80 g for 10 min, and the sediment or pellet was resuspended and stored until use in 4 mL Na+- and K+-free buffer of the following composition (in millimolar): KCl 20, H2PO4, taurine 10, L-glutamic acid 70, β-OH-butyrate 10, EGTA 10, albumin 1%, and glucose 10 (pH 7.4), supplemented with 0.5 mM Ca2+ in three steps at room temperature.

Atrial differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived atrial cardiomyocytes and generation of atrial engineered heart tissue

Work with hiPSC-CM conformed to the principles outlined by the Declaration of Helsinki. A skin fibroblast–derived hiPSC line was used for this study with informed consent of the donor. All procedures involving the generation and analysis of hiPSC lines were approved by the local ethics committee in Hamburg (Az PV4798). Procedures for hiPSC expansion, atrial cardiomyocyte differentiation, and EHT generation for hiPSC lines were performed according to published in-house standardized protocol.12 Shortly, as previously reported, embryoid bodies were generated from expanded hiPSC-stirred suspension using spinner flasks. Mesodermal induction was executed by a growth factor cocktail (2 ng/mL BMP-4 and BMP-5 ng/mL activin A: R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, and Miltenyi Biotec, Cologne, Germany) for 3 days and the cardiac differentiation by WNT signal inhibitor XAV 939 (1 μM; Tocris, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). To induce differentiation towards a hiPSC-aCMs, RA (1 µM; Sigma, St. Louis) was added for the first 72 h of WNT signalling inhibition as recently described.3,5,8

EHTs were generated from 1 million hiPSC-aCMs per construct. The fibrin gel matrix was made by mixing hiPSC-aCM, fibrinogen (Sigma F4753, St. Louis, MO, USA), and thrombin (100 U/L, T7513, St. Louis, MO, USA), which were poured into agarose (1%) casting molds with silicone posts inserted from above.12 EHTs were cultured at 37°C in a humidified cell culture incubator with 7% CO2 and 40% O2 levels for 30 days before being used for experiments. The culture medium consisted of the following components: DMEM (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland), insulin at a concentration of 10 µg/mL (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), tranexamic acid at 400 μmol/L (Sigma-Aldrich 857653), and aprotinin at 33 µg/mL (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Dissociation of EHTs was performed5,8 with collagenase II (200 U/mL, 1 mg/mL, Worthington, NJ, USA) for 3.5 h at 37°C and dispersed by careful pipetting to receive hiPSC-aCMs. Isolated hiPSC-aCMs were plated on gelatin-coated (0.1%) glass coverslips (12 mm diameter; Carl Roth GmbH & Co, Karlsruhe, Germany). Subsequently, the cells were kept in culture for 24–48 h to maintain adherence under superfusion in the recording chamber during patch clamp measurements.

Expression analysis by RNA sequencing

The expression analysis by RNA sequencing was performed by the Core Facility Genomics in Münster (Medical Faculty, Muenster, Germany). Total RNA was extracted from snap frozen EHTs using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). High-quality total RNA (Agilent TapeStation 4200, RIN value check) was enriched for poly(A)-tailed RNA using the NEBNext Poly(A) magnetic isolation module (NEB) followed by NEBNext Ultra II directional RNA Library Preparation (NEB). Library was quality controlled (Agilent TapeStation 4200) and quantified (NEBNext Library Quant for Illumina, NEB), and an equimolar pool was sequenced in a single read mode, with 72 cycles on a NextSeq2000 system (Illumina).

Current measurements

Ion currents were measured at 37°C in the whole-cell configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA). The ISO2 software (MFK, Niedernhausen, Germany) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Heat-polished pipettes were pulled from borosilicate-filamented glass with an external diameter of 1.5 mm and internal diameter of 0.87 (HILG1103227; Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) with a DPZ-Universal puller (Zeitz Instruments, Munich, Germany). Tip resistances were 2.5–5 MΩ, and seal resistances were 3–6 GΩ. Cell capacitance (Cm) was calculated from steady-state current during depolarizing ramp pulses (1 V/1 s) from −40 to −35 mV. The cells were investigated in a small perfusion chamber placed on the stage of an inverse microscope. Outward currents were measured with the following bath solution (in millimolar): NaCl 120, KCl 5.4, HEPES 10, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, and glucose 10 (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). The internal solution included (in millimolar) the following: DL-Aspartate potassium salt 80, KCl 40, NaCl 8, HEPES 10, Mg-ATP 5, Tris-GTP 0.1, EGTA 5, and CaCl2 2 (pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH). Currents were elicited by 5 s long test pulses to +50 mV, applied every 10 s (holding potential was kept at −40 mV to inactivate Na+ currents). Contaminating Ca2+ currents were suppressed with the selective L-type calcium channel blocker nisoldipine (10 µM; Sigma, PHR1290, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were exposed to a single concentration of the selective IKs blocker HMR-1556 (1 µM, Aventis Pharma, Germany).13 In some experiments, cells were exposed first to the non-selective β-adrenoceptor agonist (-)-isoprenaline (1 µM; Sigma, I5627, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and on top to HMR-1556. Bath solutions containing isoprenaline were freshly prepared every day from frozen stock solutions that were stored at −20°C.

I Ks currents were calculated as difference traces subtracted from traces recorded in the absence and presence of HMR-1556. From 1 µM HMR-1556, we assumed a complete block of IKs. We ignored the marginal block of other currents 1 µM HMR-1556 on (ICa, L ∼10% and Ito ∼5%). HMR-1556 at 1 µM does not block IKr in guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes.13 We defined a cell as having IKs by a persistent 10% drop in outward current upon 1 µM HMR-1556 within 1 min. Voltage dependency of IKs activation was estimated from HMR-1556–sensitive tail currents (at −40 mV) following different test pulse potentials. Currents were normalized to their maximum and plotted against the actual test pulse potential. A Boltzmann function was fitted to the normalized values by the following equation: I/I0 = 1 / (1 + exp((Vm − V0.5act) / kact)), where Vm, V0.5act, and kact are the test pulse potential, the voltage of half-maximum activation, and the slope factor, respectively, using GraphPad Prism software version 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Activation and deactivation kinetics were estimated by fitting single exponential functions to HMR-1556–sensitive difference traces with the ANA-3 software (MFK, Niedernhausen, Germany) by the following equation:

Im=A*exp(t/τ)+B

where A is the amplitude, τ is the time constant of the exponentially increasing outward current or decreasing tail current Im, and B is the amplitude of the non-activating current component.

Action potential measurement

AP measurements in intact atrial trabeculae and aEHT were performed with standard sharp microelectrode pulled from the glass capillaries mentioned above.14 Tip resistance was between 25 and 55 MΩ when filled with 2 M KCl. The aEHTs were transferred from the 24-well EHT culture plate into the recording chamber and fixed with needles in an optimal position for AP recording. Tissues were continuously superfused with Tyrode’s solution (in millimolar): NaCl 127, KCl 5.4, MgCl2 1.05, CaCl2 1.8, glucose 10, NaHCO3 22, and NaHPO4 0.42, balanced with O2-CO2 (95:5) at 36°C (pH 7.4).

The signals were amplified by a BA-1s npi amplifier (npi electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany) and recorded and analysed offline using the Lab-Chart software (version 8, AD Instruments Pty Ltd., Castle Hill NSW, Australia). To block the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), we used E-4031 (1 µM; 1808, Tocris Bioscience, UK) to block IKur 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) (100 µM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and IKs HMR-1556 (1 µM; Aventis Pharma, Germany).

Drug effects were measured 15 min after addition of the drug, and to calculate the AP parameters, data from 15 consecutive APs were averaged. APD in aEHT was not corrected for rate.

Mathematical modelling and computer simulations of IKs and action potential in human atrial cardiomyocytes

To analyse the contribution of IKs on repolarization in the human atrium, we used the 2016 version of our established computer model of the atrial cardiomyocyte.15–17 As previously published, mathematical formulations of IKs kinetics in human CMs have taken rather different approaches. In this case, we compared the IKs amplitude and dynamics in silico by using three previously published current formulations18–20 and a reparametrized formulation in the simulations (see Supplementary material online, Figures S2–S6). IKs activation at different heart rates was simulated, using a dynamic restitution protocol modified from Koller et al.21 Starting from a dynamic pacing steady state (at basic cycle length (BCL) = 1500 ms), BCL was decreased in 50 ms steps (BCL = 1500: −50:250), which corresponds to beating per minutes increasing from 40 to 240. At each BCL, 50 stimuli were applied, and the last AP for each BCL was saved for analysis. We adjusted the conductances of IKr and IKur in the human CM model slightly to improve the spike and dome AP shape and to better match the current block effects on AP morphology observed in vitro.

To model the effect of persistent AF in silico, we used our previously published scheme15,17 that accounts for the remodelling sarcolemmal ion currents, intracellular calcium handling, and cellular hypertrophy. We updated the IKs multiplication parameter from 2.45 to 1.97 to match the AF-related change in IKs that was shown in our new in vitro data.

Inhibitory effects of HMR-1556 and 4-AP on ICaL, Ito, IKur, IKr, and IKs were accounted for in the simulations by using the standard single pore block model. Full details of the mathematical modelling and simulation approach are described in the Supplementary material online.

Results

Human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived atrial cardiomyocytes express genes encoding for Ks channel proteins and regulatory subunits

In the human heart, mRNA for KCNQ1, MinK1, KCNE1, and AKAP922 is expressed in both atrium and ventricles.23 Thus, we measured if this holds true for ventricular and atrial EHTs generated from hiPSC-CM and hiPSC-aCM, respectively. While KCNQ1 mRNA abundance was significantly larger, AKAP9 was smaller in atrial than ventricular EHTs. Furthermore, KCNE1 and MinK1 mRNA abundance did not differ between atrial and ventricular EHTs (Table 2; Supplementary material online, Figure S7).

Only a fraction of atrial cardiomyocytes possessed measurable IKs, but frequencies and current amplitudes did not differ between sinus rhythm atrial cardiomyocytes, atrial fibrillation atrial cardiomyocytes, and human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived atrial cardiomyocytes

Outward currents in aCM did not show a slowly activating component as observed in human ventricular CM.9 However, some cells showed deactivating tail currents when jumping back to −40 mV (Figure 1A basal, left). To unmask the potential contribution of IKs to the outward current, we used the selective IKs blocker HMR-1556. An abrupt persistent 10% drop in outward current upon HMR-1556 was used to define the existence of IKs (Figure 1A, left). Only 23 out of 61 aCMs from patients in SR possessed IKs (37.7%). The frequency was not statistically different between aCMs to that of patients in AF (21 of 46; 45.7%) or hiPSC-aCM (26 of 66; 39.4%; Table 3). Tail currents were completely blocked by HMR-1556 (Figure 1A and B). Outward currents before adding HMR-1556 were significantly larger in hiPSC-aCM than in aCM from SR and AF. In contrast, current densities for IKs did not differ between hiPSC-aCM and aCMs from SR or AF (Figure 1C, right, and Table 3).

I Ks did not respond to β-adrenoceptor stimulation in atrial cardiomyocytes or in human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived atrial cardiomyocytes

There is a substantial increase in IKs (three- to four-fold) upon β-adrenoceptor (β-AR) stimulation in dog ventricular CM.24 Thus, we wanted to evaluate whether IKs is activated by β-AR stimulation also in human aCM and in hiPSC-aCM. Cells were first exposed to the non-selective β-AR agonist isoprenaline (1 µM) and subsequently, in the continuous presence of isoprenaline, to HMR-1556. Total outward currents did not increase after adding isoprenaline (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1) even in cells that showed clear IKs, as defined by a drop in outward current upon subsequent exposure to HMR-1556. The fraction of ‘responders’ to HMR-1556 did not differ between cells pre-treated or not pre-treated with isoprenaline. Furthermore, the effect size of HMR-1556 in ‘responders’ was not larger in isoprenaline-treated cells compared with those not treated in SR-aCM and in hiPSC-aCM (in SR: 1.5 ± 0.2 pA/pF n = 16/2 vs. 1.6 ± 0.2 pA/pF n = 23/12; in hiPSC-aCM: 2.1 ± 0.5 pA/pF n = 7/3 vs. 1.8 ± 0.2 pA/pF n = 26/9).

I Ks in human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived atrial cardiomyocytes showed voltage and time dependency of activation as seen in adult atrial cardiomyocytes

The contribution of IKs to repolarization depends on voltage and time dependency of activation. The voltage dependency of IKs activation was estimated from HMR-1556–sensitive tail currents at −40 mV following different test pulse potentials (Figure 2A). The voltages to achieve half-maximum activation (Vact0.5) did not differ between aCMs from SR, AF, and hiPSC-aCM (0, 7, and 6 mV, respectively; Figure 2B and Table 3).

(A) Original traces of HMR-1156–sensitive currents present slow activation and deactivation properties. Plus protocol is given inset. (B) The amplitude of IKs tail current was measured upon return to a holding potential of −40 mV after 5 s voltage step to different test pulse potentials.

(C and D) The activation and deactivation kinetics at increasing test pluses. Mean values ± SEM: numbers in brackets indicate cells/patients or cells/EHT.

The contribution of a time-dependent activating current to the AP shape depends on its activation and deactivation kinetics. Therefore, we fitted mono-exponential functions to HMR-1556–sensitive current traces recorded at different test pulse potentials to estimate the time course of activation kinetics over a larger voltage range (Figure 2C and D). The respective tail currents were used to measure deactivation kinetics. Both activation and deactivation of IKs were faster at more positive test pulse potentials, but again, time constants did not differ between SR-aCM, AF-aCM, and hiPSC-aCM (Figure 2C and D and Table 3).

Reparameterized mathematical formulation to recapitulate IKs activation and deactivation dynamics

To investigate to what extent IKs can contribute to atrial repolarization, we used our established computer model. While the IKs formulations developed previously for a human CM model have voltage dependencies resembling the in vitro results with reasonable accuracy, none of them could replicate the activation and deactivation kinetics of the current we saw in aCM (Figure 3). We chose the formulation by Grandi et al.18 since in this model, the voltage dependency needed to be only slightly tuned, as a starting point for a reparameterized IKs formulation. After reparameterization, the modified IKs had activation and deactivation kinetics closely matching the in vitro findings (Figure 3D and E). The properties of the four IKs formulations as well as the raw in silico data analysed in Figure 3 are shown in Supplementary material online, Figures S2 and S3, respectively. Importantly, when we used an alternative voltage clamp protocol to validate the modified model, it matched better with the in vitro data from Virág et al.25 than any of the previously published IKs formulations (see Supplementary material online, Figure S4).

The simulation results obtained with new current formulation are compared with the previous mathematical formulations: Nygren, Nygren et al. (1998); Grandi, Grandi et al. (2010); and O’Hara, O’Hara et al. (2011). (A) Peak current amplitude, (B) tail current amplitude, and (C) normalized tail current amplitude as a function of voltage. (D and E) Time constants of activation and deactivation of the currents.

Next, we performed a computer simulation to test whether IKs accumulation can occur at high fast beating rate under our conditions. While the ‘residual activation’ does increase (zoomed bottom left panel of Figure 4), the gradual decrease of APD50 and drop of the plateau voltage to more negative values more than compensate that effect. Thus, peak IKs activation is actually decreasing with increasing pacing frequency (center panel of Figure 4).

However, maximum activation during AP decreases.

In silico model predicts only a small contribution of IKs on repolarization in the human atrium even when repolarization reserve is reduced

In order to estimate whether the reparameterized IKs can contribute to repolarization in human aCM, we used an in silico model (Figures 5 and 6). The model predicted activation of IKr and IKs during the AP plateau phase. Computer modelling revealed that in SR under basal conditions, IKr maximum current density was 20-fold larger than for IKs (Figure 5B and C). Consequently, block of IKr with E-4031 increased APD90 substantially by 16.7%, while block of IKs by HMR-1556 had a negligible impact (1.5%; Figure 5A, center; Supplementary material online, Table S2). E-4031 did not prolong APD20. Slowing of repolarization started in the plateau phase, thereby increasing APD50 (see Supplementary material online, Table S3). Plateau voltage remained unaffected. As a result of IKr block, IKs activation increased by about 16% (Figure 5B, center). However, even on top of E-4031, the predicted increase in APD90 by HMR-1556 remained marginal (1.9% vs. 1.5%, Figure 5A, left, in the absence of E-4031 vs. center in the presence of E-4031; Supplementary material online, Table S2).

HMR-1556 application increased APD90 by a mere 1.9%, whereas E-4031 increased it by 16.7% and the combination by 18.2%. 4-AP increased APD90 by −2.5% and the combination by 4.3%.

HMR-1556 application increased APD90 by 2.3%, whereas E-4031 increased it by 30.5% and the combination by 33.3%. 4-AP increased APD90 by 21.3% and the combination by 38.5%. (B–E) Underlying changes in the slow, rapid, and ultra-rapid activating delayed rectifier potassium currents and the inward rectifier potassium current.

Block of IKur with 4-AP in SR shifted the plateau of the AP to positive voltages (Figure 5A, right) and therefore increased substantially activation of both IKs and IKr (13-fold for IKs and 8-fold for IKr; Figure 5B and C, right). However, the maximum amplitude of IKr was still 10-fold higher than that of IKs (Figure 5C vs. B, right). Thus, even in the presence of IKur block, the predicted prolongation APD90 by HMR-1556 remained negligible (Figure 5A, right; Supplementary material online, Table S2).

Next, we simulated IKs contribution to repolarization in AF. Our computer model nicely reproduced the higher plateau potential in AF than in SR10 under basal conditions (Figure 5A vs. 6A), leading to a stronger activation of both IKs and IKr compared with SR (four-fold vs. two-fold; Figure 5B and C, left, vs. Figure 6B and C, left). Again, as seen in SR, maximum activation of IKr was still more than 10 times higher than that of IKs (Figure 6B vs. C). Consequently, IKr but not IKs dominated repolarization, since predicted prolongation of APD90 by block of IKr was 30.5%, while prolongation by IKs block was marginal (+2.3%; Figure 6A, center; Supplementary material online, Table S2). IKr block slightly prolonged the plateau phase (see Supplementary material online, Table S3) that led to a stronger activation of IKs (Figure 6B). However, the maximum activated IKs was still very small (Figure 6B, center). Thus, even in the presence of E-4031, application of HMR-1556 prolonged APD90 by only +2.8% (Figure 6B, center; Supplementary material online, Table S2).

Block of IKur in AF almost doubled APD20 (Figure 6A, right), increasing activation of both IKs and IKr (eight-fold for IKs and five-fold for IKr; Figure 6B and C, right). Since activation of both IKr and IKs was larger in AF even under basal conditions (in the absence of IKur block), maximum IKs amplitudes reached now values close to 0.1 pA/pF, now 30 times higher than in SR (basal in Figure 5B). In contrast, IKr amplitudes were 10-fold larger in AF (IKur blocked; Figure 6C, right) compared with SR (basal; Figure 5C, left). As a result, repolarization is dominated by IKr vs. IKs to a lesser extent facilitating contribution of IKs to repolarization resulting in a predicted increase in APD90 by 15% (Figure 6A; Supplementary material online, Table S2).

Model validation by in vitro measurements of action potential in human atrial tissue

Models are an attractive tool to study cardiac electrophysiology. Utility of a model depends on how closely such a model recapitulates real findings. Therefore, we have compared the in silico predictions on IKs contribution to repolarization to in vitro findings obtained from human atrial trabeculae (both SR and AF).

In preliminary experiments, AP shape in atrial trabeculae from both SR and AF did not change upon exposure to HMR-1556 alone (data not shown). Therefore, we tested whether model predictions on IKs contribution under reduced repolarization reserve are correct. Firstly, we blocked IKr with E-4031 (1 µM). In SR, E-4031 prolonged APD90, while APD20 remained unchanged. HMR-1556 on top of E-4031 did not prolong APD90 further (Figure 7A and Table 4). In a next set of experiments, we blocked IKur first. For this purpose, we exposed tissues to 100 µM 4-AP and subsequently in the continuous presence of 4-AP to HMR-1556 (1 µM). As seen before in SR,26 4-AP increased APD20 and shifted plateau voltage to positive values but shortened APD90. Importantly, in the context of the present study, HMR-1556 on top of 4-AP did not prolong APD90 (Figure 7C and Table 5).

Figure 7 Reduction of repolarization reserve by block of ultra-rapid and rapid potassium outward currents did not unmask contribution of IKs to action potential shape in human adult atrial tissue and in aEHT. AP traces are presented as the average of all group experiments (solid lines) and SEM (dotted lines) in SR (A and C), in AF (E), and in atrial EHT (B, D).

In silico model for atrial fibrillation

We could confirm key findings in AF: the basal APD20 values were much longer, VPLT less negative, and APD90 much shorter than SR.26 As shown before, for a larger number of human right atrial tissues,10 APD20 was longer and plateau voltage was higher in AF compared with SR (Figure 7C and E; Supplementary material online, Table S1). In AF, 4-AP increased not only APD20 but also APD90. However, in contrast to model predictions, block of IKs on top of IKur block did not prolong APD90 further (Figure 7E and Table 5).

Atrial engineered heart tissue as a model for sinus rhythm

Here, we present physiological current densities and biophysical properties of IKs in hiPSC-aCM. In order to evaluate whether our findings on IKs in hiPSC-aCM translate to the negligible contribution of IKs to repolarization as seen in SR, we measured AP in aEHT.

Block of IKs with HMR-1556 alone did not prolong APD (data not shown) in aEHT. Block of IKur with 100 µM 4-AP prolonged APD20 but shortened APD90. HMR-1556 on top of 4-AP did not prolong APD (Figure 7D and Table 5). Furthermore, E-4031 did not prolong early repolarization phase (APD20) but also plateau phase (APD50) and late repolarization (APD90). Again, HMR-1556 was without effect on APD (Figure 7B and Table 4).

It should be noted that aEHT beats spontaneously at 3.1 ± 0.2 Hz. APD90 (169.1 ± 12.7 ms) in aEHT was similar to APD90 in atrial tissue (SR) when paced at 3 Hz.27 Importantly, APD90 but not APD20 did not shorten with higher pacing rate in human atrial tissue.27 Thus, APD20 in aEHT seems (at least at 3 Hz) was not different than in SR at 1 Hz (see Supplementary material online, Table S1).

aEHT may represent a nice model to study human electrophysiology, since they recapitulate lack of IKs contribution to repolarization even when other potassium currents in SR are blocked. In silico models for human atrial AP need further improvement to reproduce the physiological situation in SR. Slowly beating aEHTs are needed to investigate whether EHTs are useful to study electrical remodelling as seen in AF.

Discussion

The main results of our study are as follows:

HMR-1556 revealed the presence of IKs in ∼half of human aCM.

The properties of IKs in hiPSC-aCM closely resemble the situation in aCM.

I Ks does not contribute relevantly to AP shape in human atrial tissues in SR or in aEHT.

 

Detection of IKs in human atrial cardiomyocytes

In ventricular CM from several species (human, guinea pig, and dog), potassium outward currents are dominated by the slowly activating IKs.9,24,28 In contrast, in human aCM, large rapidly activating transient potassium outward currents sensitive to 4-AP29 mask IKs. This is due to the fact that tau values for inactivation of transient potassium outward currents30,31 lie in the same range as those for activation of IKs (600 ms at +50 mV, 36°C). Consequently, early studies in human aCM have defined IKs as the current resistant to high concentrations of 4-AP (2 mM), which block the transient potassium outward currents in the human atrium: IKur and Ito.32–34 With the development of HMR-1556, blocking IKs but not IKur and Ito,13 direct proof for IKs became available.

Our findings that not all CMs possess IKs are in line with the findings in human ventricular CM, where IKs was defined by other IKs blockers (L-735,821 or chromanol 293B). The results are difficult to directly compare to our findings, because in both studies, the researchers used pipette solutions containing the direct adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin in order to facilitate detection of IKs.25,35 However, even under these conditions, IKs was found in only ∼50% of human ventricular CM.25 No data are given for experiments without forskolin. In another study, IKs was found in only 1 out of 53 human aCMs. Unfortunately, the authors did not report the method to identify IKs.36 In addition, there is only one paper on IKs in hiPSC-aCM, which reported HMR-1556–sensitive outward currents. However, current traces miss the typical slow activation and deactivation, questioning whether the HMR-1556–sensitive currents do in fact represent IKs.37

Biophysics of IKs in human atrial cardiomyocytes

The current density and the speed of activation affect the contribution of an ion current to AP shape. Current densities for activating IKs at the end of the test pulse are not given for human ventricular CM.25,35 However, from tail current amplitudes in both aCMs (SR and AF), we can conclude that IKs tail currents (SR-aCM: 0.3 ± 0.0, n = 5/5; AF-aCM: 0.5 ± 0.0 at +50 mV) are similar in human ventricular CM (0.2 pA/pF at +50 mV25; 0.25 pA/pF at +30 mV35). However, in hiPSC-aCM, IKs tail currents (hiPSC-aCM 0.7 ± 0.0, n = 32/5 at +50 mV) were almost four times larger than that in human ventricular CM.

The voltage dependency of IKs activation in hiPSC-aCM and aCM (SR and AF) was close to values reported for human ventricular CM in one study9 (Vact0.5 ∼0 vs. ∼+10 mV). In contrast, Pérez-Hernández et al32 reported much more positive values in human aCM (Vact0.5 in SR +35 mV), whereas in AF, Vact0.5 was substantially shifted to less positive values than in SR (+13 mV). It remains open whether different experimental conditions may account for the differences (room temperature vs. 37°C in our study). Fast heart beat can favour accumulation of IKs in dog ventricular cardiomyocytes.38 Our simulation results suggest that under conditions (AP shape, IKs kinetics as found here), there is no ‘accumulation’ of IKs activation at higher pacing frequencies in the human atrium.

Anyhow, we cannot confirm that AF remodelling would affect voltage dependency of IKs activation. However, there seems to be a clear effect of temperature on IKs kinetics. While deactivation kinetics measured in aCM and in hiPSC-aCM (120 ms) match nicely with data in human ventricular CM,25,35  IKs activation at room temperature was slower than at 37°C: tau was 1.8 s at room temperature32 vs. ∼400 ms at 37°C in our study. Furthermore, activation of IKs in human aCM and in hiPSC-aCM seems to be generally faster than in human ventricular CM (tau at +50 mV, 37°C: 800 ms9). At present, we cannot explain differences in IKs biophysics between human aCM (this study) and human ventricular CM.25,35 Our findings suggest potentially relevant chamber-dependent differences in IKs biophysics. Anyhow, our results clearly indicate that IKs is present in hiPSC-aCM and that IKs biophysics closely resembles the situation in human adult aCM.

Contribution of IKs to repolarization in the human atrium when repolarization reserve is reduced

Biophysical properties of IKs were measured by rectangular voltage step protocols with very positive test pulse potentials and very long test pulse durations. We have used such an approach to better compare our results to findings from the literature (see above). However, contribution of IKs to repolarization depends on membrane voltage during an AP. In SR, APD20 is very short and plateau voltage quite negative making IKs contribution to repolarization very unlikely. Using an AP as a command pulse for voltage clamping39 also called ‘dynamic clamping’ is a very elegant approach to detect activation of IKs (as a HMR-1556–induced current) under physiological conditions. Here, we used a different approach to determine whether IKs can be activated during an AP in the human atrium. Our in silico model demonstrates activation of IKs during an atrial AP in SR but to a much lesser extent than IKr. Findings resemble the situation in dog ventricles, where IKr unmasks IKs contribution to repolarization.9,40 Situation is different in the human heart where block of IKr alone did not unmask IKs contribution in the ventricles9 and also not in the human atrium (SR and AF, this study). In the human atrium, early repolarization is dominated by a potassium current that is not present in the ventricles: IKur. Block of IKur can markedly increase IKr and IKs activation and produces a seemingly paradoxical shortening of APD90 in SR,26 a finding replicated in our study in aEHT. However, even under this condition, IKr dominates over IKs in our in silico model so substantially that IKs has no considerable contribution to repolarization. Predictions were confirmed by experimental data in SR but also in aEHT, qualifying both models as helpful to study human atrial electrophysiology.

Contribution of IKs to repolarization in atrial fibrillation

Situation is different in AF, where APD20 is much longer and plateau voltage clearly above 0 mV, a value substantially above the V0.5 activation of IKs reported here. Nevertheless, activation of IKs in AF is very small. Computer models are an established tool in cellular cardiac electrophysiology.41 Obviously, computer models should recapitulate experimental observations. Reasons for the mentioned above discrepancy remain open but illustrate that the present in silico models for AF-induced remodelling may need further refinement. It is hard to decide if the model has failed or if the data used to feed the model were imperfect. We have not measured tachypacing-remodelled aEHT since at present, beating rate in atrial EHTs is high (∼3 Hz in this study), close to the rate used for tachypacing.6

Relevance of IKs for human atrium vs. ventricle: is β-adrenoceptor-responsiveness of IKs the crucial point?

The transcript levels for α subunits mediating IKs and IKr are similar in atrial and ventricular tissues.23 From this finding, one could expect relevance of IKs and IKr in both chambers. However, LQT2 (mutation in IKr) but not LQT1 (mutation in IKs) has an impact on AF in humans. We suspect that lack of β-AR stimulation to increase IKs could play a role. The lack of isoprenaline to increase IKs in atrial CM is perplexing and could be interpreted that our cells (both aCM and hiPSC-aCM) lack β-AR receptor and/or other key proteins of cAMP/PKA signalling. Such an assumption seems very unlikely in the case of adult human atrial CM, where β-AR stimulation increases cAMP, ICa, and force.42–44 The situation is less clear for hiPSC-aCM. However, from our own unpublished work, it is evident that hiPSC-aCMs show a consistent increase in ICa upon β-AR stimulation. We suspect that lack of effect of isoprenaline on IKs could be a common finding in atrial tissue, since we could also not detect an increase in IKs upon isoprenaline in guinea pig atrial cardiomyocytes (data not shown). No data are available on β-AR responsiveness of IKs in aCM from other species. In isolated dog ventricular CM, stimulation of β-AR increases IKs and β-AR stimulation alone is sufficient to unmask IKs contribution to repolarization.24 The situation in human ventricle is more complex since two interventions (β-AR stimulation and IKr block), simultaneously applied, were needed to unmask IKs contribution to repolarization.35,45 Therefore, it was concluded that β-AR stimulation is mandatory to unmask IKs contribution in human ventricles.

Despite our long-time experience, we still fail to record stable AP in atrial tissue exposed to β-AR agonists when potassium channels (IKr or IKur) are blocked. Thus, it remains open if stimulation of β-AR in the presence of IKr block may allow detection of IKs contribution to repolarization in aEHT and native human atrial tissue.

Atrial engineered heart tissue as a model to study human atrial electrophysiology

In contrast to ventricular EHTs,45 we cannot slow down beating rate in aEHT, complicating interpretation of APD data. Importantly, APD90 in fast beating aEHT (basal condition) was not shorter than in atrial tissue (SR) when paced at 3 Hz.27 Nevertheless, aEHTs8 share electrophysiological properties of human atrium (shortening of APD upon muscarinic receptor activation and prolongation of APD20 but shortening of APD90 upon blocking of IKur). We feel confident that aEHTs recapitulate key findings in contribution of delayed rectifier potassium current to repolarization in the human atrium. IKs block was without an effect on APD90, and fast beating should have facilitated contribution of IKs to repolarization. On the other hand, blocking of IKr prolonged APD90 to an extent not different in effect size compared with human SR tissue.

Translational perspective

Our findings do not support the idea that IKs should contribute to APD shortening in AF.32 The lack of β-AR stimulation–mediated increase in IKs in the human atrium might explain why LQT1 associates with ventricular but not with atrial arrhythmias. Importantly, hiPSC-aCM recapitulates key findings on IKs in the human atrium and may therefore qualify them as an interesting model to study human atrial electrophysiology.

Limitations

Chronic treatment of the patients with beta-blockers may have interfered with the results obtained both from isolated cells and in atrial trabeculae. The small number of patients not treated with β-blockers (3 out of 37) precludes a meaningful interpretation. However, we would not expect that chronic treatment of the patients with beta-blockers may have masked response of IKs to isoprenaline since β-blocker treatment increases β-AR sensitivity in atrial tissues from patients.46 This partly reverses Gi alpha-upregulation and β-AR downregulation in heart failure.47

AP measurements in human atrial tissue may not be accurate enough to detect very small increases in APD90 by 1.5% as predicted in some of our model simulations. For technical reasons, we have measured AP in right atrial tissues at low pacing rate (1 Hz). aEHT beats much faster (3.1 ± 0.2 Hz). In ventricular EHT (generated without RA hiPSC-CM), even low concentration (300 nM) of ivabradine slowed beating below 1 Hz.45 In aEHT, even very high concentration of ivabradine slowed down beating rate only by about 25% (own unpublished data). Thus, at present, we cannot slow beating rate in aEHT substantially. Due to shortage in AF tissue, we cannot provide experiments with HMR-1556 in the presence of E-4031.
