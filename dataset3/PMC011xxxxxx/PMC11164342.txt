A time-series analysis of serum Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) levels was performed in 791 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study to evaluate the development of chemoresistance and response to therapy. To investigate chemoresistance and better predict the treatment effectiveness, we examined two traits: resistance (defined as the rate of CA-125 change when patients were treated with therapy) and aggressiveness (defined as the rate of CA-125 change when patients were not treated). We found that as the number of treatment lines increases, the data-based resistance increases (a decreased rate of CA-125 decay). We use mathematical models of two distinct cancer cell types, treatment-sensitive cells and treatment-resistant cells, to estimate the values and evolution of the two traits in individual patients. By fitting to individual patient HGSOC data, our models successfully capture the dynamics of the CA-125 level. The parameters estimated from the mathematical models show that patients with inferred low growth rates of treatment-sensitive cells and treatment-resistant cells (low model-estimated aggressiveness) and a high death rate of treatment-resistant cells (low model-estimated resistance) have longer survival time after completing their second-line of therapy. These findings show that mathematical models can characterize the degree of resistance and aggressiveness in individual patients, which improves our understanding of chemoresistance development and could predict treatment effectiveness in HGSOC patients.

Author summary

Ovarian cancer is a major cause of death in women worldwide due to the emergence of treatment resistance and eventual treatment failure. Serum levels of the biomarker Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) can be used to monitor treatment response in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. We used time series of CA-125 in 791 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study to quantify the evolution of resistance and aggressiveness as a response to therapy in individual patients to predict the dynamics of CA-125 and the survival outcomes. We present two mathematical models that include treatment-resistant cells and treatment-sensitive cells. These models accurately fit the data and characterize patients with the best outcomes as those with the least model-estimated aggressively growing cells and the least model-estimated resistant cells. Models with only a single cell type provide poor fits to the data. These minimal models with just two cell types could provide a valuable tool for rapidly and robustly understanding the dynamics of individual patients and pointing the way to identifying specific mechanisms.

pmcIntroduction

Mathematical models have been widely used to provide valuable insights into biological processes and cancer biology, offering a quantitative framework to study and analyze the complex dynamics of cancer resistance. In cancer studies, models can help analyze large amounts of patient data to identify risk factors, develop personalized treatment plans, and monitor disease progression [1–3]. Ovarian cancer is a fatal gynecological malignancy and ranks fifth among the deadliest cancers in women worldwide. Around 1.2% of women are estimated to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer during their lifetime [4–6], making it the eighth most prevalent cancer in women [7]. Older women have a higher chance of developing ovarian cancer; more than 50% of ovarian cancer cases occur in women over 60 [8]. Despite its name, recent studies have shown that ovarian cancer does not always originate in the ovaries but can begin in other pelvic organs, such as the fallopian tubes, and invade the ovaries secondarily [9–11]. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common histological subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer. It is characterized in almost all cases by somatic TP53 alterations, and defects in homologous recombination DNA repair genes occur in approximately 50% of HGSOC cases, including alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 [12, 13].

The primary treatment for HGSOC patients typically consists of cytoreductive surgery and either adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, most commonly a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Contemporary treatment includes maintenance poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) with or without bevacizumab in a selected subset of patients [14]. Subsequent lines of treatment are chosen largely based on the patient’s response to the previous treatment line, particularly the time between the end of carboplatin-based chemotherapy and subsequent relapse, known as the platinum-free interval [15]. In patients with HGSOC, serum Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) levels are widely used to monitor the treatment response [7, 16]. CA-125 is expressed on the surface of epithelial ovarian cancer cells. It is shed into the circulation and can be quantified in serum [6, 16, 17]. CA-125 levels differ across ovarian cancer subtypes, with HGSOC showing the highest average expression [16, 18]. Following surgical intervention and/or chemotherapy, a reduction in CA-125 levels in the bloodstream is expected as a marker of treatment effectiveness. Conversely, an elevation in CA-125 levels may suggest either inadequate therapeutic response or disease progression. In cases where the primary treatment for ovarian cancer involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, which is usually the standard of care, the decrease in CA-125 levels may not directly indicate the response to chemotherapy because the decline in CA-125 levels is a result of both treatment modalities working in tandem [19]. During their cancer journey, women with ovarian cancer undergo periodic CA-125 blood tests as a standard protocol for monitoring. An increase in the levels of CA-125 can indicate cancer recurrence and progression, which would require further diagnostic evaluations, such as imaging studies, to confirm disease progression [20]. Nonetheless, monitoring CA-125 levels during first-line therapy helps predict chemotherapy sensitivity, resistance, survival, and progression-free interval [21]. Cancer recurrence and progression may indicate resistance to treatment.

After primary surgery and the first line of chemotherapy, approximately 70–80% of HGSOC ovarian cancer patients experience recurrence and require additional lines of therapy [22]. Patients with ovarian cancer are classified as platinum-resistant or platinum-sensitive based on their progression-free interval, which is often calculated from the end of the first line of treatment to the date of first progression or recurrence [15, 23]. With recurrent disease and multiple lines of therapy, resistance to therapy can evolve, leading to reduced response to treatment [24, 25]. Many mechanisms that underlie chemoresistance evolution in ovarian cancer have been identified [26]. In the absence of detailed cell-specific data at each point of treatment failure, predicting the response to subsequent treatments is difficult. Inferring the properties of cancer cells without detailed cell-specific data can be overcome by using mathematical models [27–31]. Mathematical models that simulate cancer cell behavior and interactions with the tumor microenvironment provide insights into tumor development, progression, therapy effectiveness, biomarkers, and drug resistance.

In this study, we analyzed the response to ovarian cancer treatment using the dynamics of CA-125 in HGSOC patients to predict overall survival time. We hypothesized that two cell properties characterize ovarian cancer patients: resistance and aggressiveness. Resistance describes cell population change when patients were treated during lines of treatment, and aggressiveness describes cells change when patients were not treated between treatment lines. Patients can differ in their initial level or frequency of resistance or in the rate at which resistance and aggressiveness evolve. Accordingly, we developed two contrasting models of heterogeneity based on serial CA-125 measurements in a large cohort of women with HGSOC. The first model uses ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with two types of cancer cells: drug-resistant and drug-sensitive. Models with drug sensitive and drug resistant cells have been well studied to understand the dynamics of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer [32–35]. Such models have not been applied to study CA-125 levels in ovarian cancer. A simple linear ODE model describing the replication and death of sensitive and resistant cells is easily understandable and interpretable, making it highly accessible. The model offers faster computation and provides insights into the basic dynamics of the cancer population. The second model builds on the framework of adaptive dynamics from evolutionary ecology to model the evolution of the average level of drug resistance in the cancer cell population [36–38]. The model provides a continuum of cell types, which can capture the variation of treatment-resistance levels in the cancer cell population.

Our overall aim is to use mathematical models of CA-125 dynamics to understand tumor evolution and evaluate factors that predict overall survival. Our approach leverages clinical data to identify the key factors and covariates impacting patient survival using statistical methods such as Cox proportional hazards. We investigate a simple mathematical model of resistance and aggressiveness to capture the dynamics of CA-125 levels in a large cohort of patients with HGSOC. We compare the predictive performance of an ODE model with separate treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant cell populations against an adaptive dynamic model with a continuum of levels of treatment-resistant levels to determine which model better captures the dynamics of CA-125 levels. By individually fitting the initial lines of therapy of each HGSOC patient from clinical data to a mathematical model, we investigate whether the models can accurately capture the short-term and long-term dynamics of CA-125 levels, predict its future dynamics, and enhance the accuracy of survivorship predictions.

Data analysis

Data

Patients with HGSOC were identified in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS), an Australia-wide population-based molecular epidemiological study [39]. The dataset includes longitudinal serum CA-125 level measurements from 1057 patients with HGSOC. Among these patients, 1052 (99.5%) underwent primary treatment that included either primary debulking surgery (PDS) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). A total of 882 HGSOC patients (83.44%) progressed, and 793 HGSOC patients (75.02%) died during the study period (median survival of 3.6 years, with a range of 17 days to 33.9 years). To be considered for our statistical and mathematical analysis, HGSOC patients were required to have undergone second-line treatment after disease progression. Patients with fewer than six data points for CA-125 were excluded from the study. Of 1057 patients, a total of 791 patients met these qualification criteria and were included in the analysis. Additional details regarding the inclusion criteria can be found in S1 Fig.

In addition to patient-specific CA-125 levels, clinical data included the normal range of CA-125 levels, patient age at diagnosis, types of drugs in each line of treatment, the primary surgery date, residual disease following cytoreductive surgery, cause of death, and the date of the last follow-up. From the clinical data, we used linear regression to estimate the data-based resistance as the slope of the log-transformed CA-125 level change when patients were treated during each line of therapy and the data-based aggressiveness as the slope of the log-transformed CA-125 level change when patients were not receiving therapy in each individual patient. The values of data-based resistance and data-based aggressiveness serve as descriptors of changing in CA-125 level to show how patients respond during and between treatments. The estimation process was performed separately for each individual patient for each treatment line (Fig 1A). The data-based resistance and data-based aggressiveness were estimated using linear regression with patients treated as fixed effects (lm [40]) or random effects (lme4 [41] in R [40]). Fixed effects treat patients as independent individuals and random effects treat patients as members of a population.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using software R [40]. The survival time of HGSOC patients after each line of treatment was measured as the time between the end of the treatment line and the day of death or the last follow-up. The progression-free interval (PFI) after the first-line treatment was measured as the time between the end of the first line of chemotherapy and the date of disease progression. The Cox proportional hazards (coxph of the survival package [42] in R) was used to analyze survival times and PFI. The Kaplan-Meier plots are analyzed for significance using the log-rank test. In this study, we used the Wilcoxon test to the survival analysis and computed the p-value. We used the Pearson correlation though out the study to test the linear correlation between the variable of interest.

Mathematical modeling

Treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant cell model (SR model)

The treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant cells model (SR model) tracks the continuous-time dynamics of the populations of two types of cancer cells: treatment-sensitive cells (S) and treatment-resistant cells (R) (Fig 1B). During lines of treatment, cells die at rate δR for treatment-resistant cells and rate δS for treatment-sensitive cells. Similarly, the growth rate of cells when patients were not undergoing treatment are denoted by γS for treatment-sensitive cells and γR for treatment-resistant cells. The death rate (δ) thus represents resistance, and the growth rate (γ) represents aggressiveness. Treatment-sensitive cells can become treatment-resistant cells at the transition rate μ. Information of parameters can be found in Table 1. The assumptions regarding the death rate (δ) and the growth rate (γ) for the sensitive cells and resistant cells are as follows:

In order to maintain model simplicity, all growth and death rates (γR, γS, δR, δS) remain constant over time, regardless of the distinct treatment regimens employed in each treatment line.

Both sensitive and resistant cells have the capacity to proliferate in the absence of treatment. It is assumed that the growth rates (γS, γR) are positive values.

To denote the impact of treatment on sensitive cells, the death rate of sensitive cells (δS) is constrained to be positive.

Due to the limited efficacy of treatment on resistant cells, the death rate of resistant cells (δR) can take on positive or negative values.

Summary of parameters used in the models.

To link with the data, treatment-sensitive (S) and treatment-resistant cells (R) were assumed to proportionally generate amounts of CA-125 and neglected other CA-125 production sources. The level of CA-125 (C) is given by C=R+S. (1)

An extended model, where C follows a differential equation with a half-life δC, dCdt=δC(R+S-C) (2)

produces similar results.

The complete system of differential equations for cancer cell dynamics is dRdt=(1-α)γRR-αδRR+μS (3)

dSdt=(1-α)γSS-αδSS-μS (4)

where α = 1 when the patient is treated during lines of treatment and α = 0 when the patient is off treatment (Fig 1A). In Fig 1A, the designations “first-line”, “second-line”, “third-line”, etc., correspond to different treatment lines. During these lines of treatment, α = 1 and it is 0, otherwise. The vertical lines in lines of treatment symbolize the specific instances when drugs are administered to the patient, which is called treatment cycle. The group of cycles including the gap between them is line of treatment.

The SR model was tested under three scenarios, providing mechanisms for the emergence of treatment-resistant cells assuming the value of initial condition of CA-125 (C(0) is taken from clinical data. First, in the SR model with a pre-existing treatment-resistant cell population (the SR and R0 model), treatment-resistant cells are present in the initial conditions before treatment commenced, with parameters μ = 0, R(0)>0, and C(0) = R(0) + S(0). Second, the SR model with treatment-resistant cells arising from the transformation of treatment-sensitive cells (the SR and μ model), without the presence of initial treatment-resistant cells at the start of treatment, with specific parameters μ > 0, R(0) = 0, and C(0) = S(0). Third, the single cell-type model has no resistant cells, created as a special case of the SR model with parameters μ = 0, R(0) = 0, and C(0) = S(0).

Adaptive dynamics model

The adaptive dynamics model (AD model) considers a continuum of cell types instead of just two distinct cell types as in the SR model [43] (Fig 1C). At any given time t, it is assumed that all cancer cells (N) have the same level of chemoresistance (x). The cancer cell population has a death rate δ(x) during treatment (α = 1) and a growth rate γ(x) when patients were not receiving treatment (α = 0). The level of chemoresistance (x) evolves up the fitness gradient with the net growth of the population. The equations governing the adaptive dynamics model are dNdt=(1-α)γ(x)N-αδ(x)N (5)

∂x∂t=K∂W∂x, (6)

where W(x) = (1 − α)γ(x) − αδ(x) is the net growth of population N. The equation for x describes the evolution, and the parameter K sets the response rate to the selection gradient, which is set to 0.01. The growth rate γ(x) and death rate δ(x) are defined functions as γ(x)=γR+(γS-γR)11+eBγx+Aγ (7)

δ(x)=δR+(δS-δR)11+eBδx+Aδ. (8)

As x → ∞ the cancer cell population is made up of the most treatment-resistant cells with growth rate γR. Conversely, as x → −∞, the cancer cell population consists of the most treatment-sensitive cells with a growth rate γS and a death rate δS. Treatment thus favors a lower death rate and increased chemoresistance (x) (Fig 1D), and lack of treatment favors a higher growth rate and decreased chemoresistance (x) (Fig 1E). The assumptions regarding δS, δR, γS, and γR are the same as in the SR model. Information of parameters can be found in Table 1.

Parameter estimation

We used minimization of least squares to estimate the model parameters for each of the 791 HGSOC patients who had completed at least two lines of therapy and fulfilled the applicable data criteria. The models were fitted to clinical data using four different sets of data, including all available data points (all-line fitting), data from the two initial lines (two-line fitting), data from the three initial lines (three-line fitting), and data from the first four lines of treatment (four-line fitting). The sum of the squared deviations between the log-transformed CA-125 and the values predicted by each model was minimized. With a model written as [44] dZdt=f(Z,t,θ), (9)

where θ represents the set of parameters of the model, Z = Z(t, θ) is the state variables, and t is the time variable. We estimated the parameters by minimizing the objective function, ∑ti||Yi-Zi(ti,θ)||22, (10)

where ti represents the time with measurements and Yi the observed data at a time ti. We use the function optim [40] in the software R to minimize the sum of squared errors and estimate the parameters θ. For both the SR and AD models, the rate of growth of treatment-sensitive cells, the rate of growth of treatment-resistant cells, the death rate of treatment-sensitive cells, the rate of treatment-sensitive cells transform to treatment-resistant cells, and the initial value of treatment-resistant cells were estimated under the constraint that δS ≥ 0, γS ≥ 0, γR ≥ 0, R(0)≥0, and μ ≥ 0. The model fitting and parameter estimation are carried out individually for each patient. The initial estimates for each parameter (δR, δS, γR, and γS) are derived from data-based measurements of resistance and aggressiveness.

To explore whether the early response can predict later dynamics of CA-125 level, the parameters estimated with two-line fitting, three-line fitting, and four-line fitting were used to numerically solve the equations using the actual dates of treatment for that patient (S2 Fig).

Model comparison

The estimated parameters were utilized to numerically solve the models for all 791 eligible HGSOC patients, which were then compared to the observed CA-125 levels in the clinical data. To compare and determine the effectiveness of the SR and the AD models with all-line fitting, we compared the model’s predicted CA-125 levels against the prediction of a smoothing function applied to the data (Friedman’s SuperSmoother) [40] because of the large number of data points for each patient and the variability in the data. In this context, the Friedman’s SuperSmoother function is a reference point that provides a baseline for assessing any model’s ability to faithfully replicate the main trends in the data. The goodness of fit ratio is given by: ratio=RSSsupRSSmodel, (11)

where RSSmodel is the sum of the squared errors between the clinical CA-125 values and the CA-125 levels predicted by the model. The RSSsup represents the sum of the squared deviations between the clinical CA-125 values and the CA-125 levels predicted by the supsmu function. Specifically, when this ratio close to 1, the fit of the model to the observed data aligns closely to the fit of the SuperSmoother function. Conversely, deviations of this ratio from 1 quantify discrepancies between the model’s predictions and the empirical data in comparison with the SuperSmoother function. We use the coefficient of determination, R2, to assess the power of the mathematical model to explain the observed data. For model comparison, we use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) which favors models with a good fit to the data but penalizes additional parameters. A lower AIC supports a model that better balances fit and simplicity, and is given by AIC=2k-2lnL, (12)

where k is number of parameters in the model, ln L is log likelihood of the model [45]. When comparing two-line fitting, three-line fitting, and four-line fitting, the coefficient of determination (R2) highlights the degree to which the model fits the clinical data. Given the smaller dataset for comparison and its familiarity we use R2 to assess and compare the performance of two-line fitting, three-line fitting, and four-line fitting. Three distinct R2 values were computed to assess the model’s fitting and prediction of future CA-125 dynamics over the short and long run from the fitting lines. The goodness of fit of the model fits, as represented by (R2 fitted line), is determined by calculating the R2 value based on the levels of CA-125 used in the fitting process. The short-term prediction (R2 next line) employs the CA-125 values from the subsequent line after the fitted lines to compute the R2 value (for the two-line fitting, data from the third line of treatment is used for calculation). For long-term prediction (R2 all later lines), all the CA-125 values not utilized in the fitting process are employed to compute the R2 value. The graphical depiction of the data utilized for computing both R2 values can be found in S2 Fig. The parameters (δR, δS, γR, γS, R(0), and μ) derived from fitting both the SR and AD models with the clinical data were utilized to evaluate the models’ predictive capability for patient survival via survival analysis either in isolation or in combination with the estimates of data-based resistance and data-based aggressiveness directly from the data. The overall survival time is calculated from the end of the second-line treatment to the last follow-up or mortality date to avoid survivorship bias. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to analyze the predictive value of these parameters.

Study selection and characteristics

A total of 791 patients diagnosed with High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) were deemed eligible for inclusion in the study based on specific criteria, including disease progression, completion of second-line treatment, and the collection of more than six CA-125 data points and receiving a platinum-based regimen as their first-line therapy (S1 Fig). A Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to analyze the key factors that predict patients’ survival. The overall survival time is calculated from the end of the second-line treatment to the last follow-up or mortality date. In terms of the first-line treatment, 633 out of 791 patients (80.03%) underwent primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy treatment (PDS), while 158 patients (29.97%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The use of platinum drugs in the second line of treatment is generally based on the response to the first line by considering the duration of the progression-free interval (PFI; Methods). Patients with PFI greater than six months are usually categorized as platinum-sensitive and are more likely to receive platinum-based chemotherapy as the second-line treatment.

The data categorize patients into two groups based on the size of their residual disease following cytoreductive surgery: patients with residual disease limited to ≤1 cm maximum diameter and patients with residual disease >1 cm diameter. Patients with residual disease of ≤1 cm maximum diameter exhibited a statistically significant higher survival than patients with residual disease >1 cm diameter (Hazard ratio = 1.417 and Table 2). The use of PDS in the first-line treatment and lower diagnosis age was associated with a reduced risk of death after finishing the second-line treatment (Table 2). Patients with lower pre-treatment CA-125 levels demonstrated a longer overall survival period (Hazard ratio = 1.448 and Table 2). Patients with a longer progression-free interval (PFI) exhibited a higher likelihood of survival following the completion of second-line treatment (Hazard ratio 0.999 and p < 2 × 10−16).

Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval of death after the second line of treatment for each variable using univariate Cox proportional hazards regression. log(Pre-treatment CA-125) represents the value of CA-125 before starting the first-line treatment in the log scale. The PDS is primary surgery followed by chemotherapy treatment, while NACT is the neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Changes in data-based resistance and data-based aggressiveness during lines of therapy

Data-based resistance was defined as the slope of the change in log-transformed CA-125 levels during each line of therapy (when patients were on-treatment). Data-based aggressiveness was formally defined as the slope of the increase in log-transformed CA-125 levels during the interval from the conclusion of one line of treatment to the initiation of the subsequent treatment line. These values were estimated as a slope of CA-125 changing over time using linear regression with random effects across each individual line of the first six lines of therapy, separately. Because the data-based resistance is typically negative, a lower data-based resistance value indicates a faster decline in CA-125 level. An increase in CA-125 during lines of treatment indicates a high level of resistance. We estimate data-based resistance independently for each of the initial six lines of treatment. Data-based resistance increased as patients advanced through subsequent lines of treatment reflecting a diminishing treatment response after more treatment lines. (Fig 2A). Across patients, several correlations characterized different states. Patients with a high initial CA-125 level before first-line treatment showed a faster rate of CA-125 decrease during first-line treatment (p < 2 × 10−16 and S1 Table) but had no effect on the subsequent relapse. In contrast, data-based aggressiveness showed no clear trend across different lines of treatment (Fig 2B). Patients with higher data-based resistance to first-line treatment showed weak but significantly higher data-based resistance to second-line treatment (p = 0.012 and S1 Table) and weakly but significantly lower data-based aggressiveness after first-line treatment (p = 0.03). Data-based aggressiveness after first-line treatment was correlated with data-based aggressiveness after second-line treatment (p < 0.05 and S2 Table). The correlations between data-based resistance and data-based aggressiveness became successively weaker with additional lines of treatment. The dosage is typically administered every 21 days. The duration of each treatment line ranges from 0 to 2,702 days, with a median duration of 106 days. The interval between successive treatment lines ranges from 0 to 4,879 days, with a median interval of 165 days.

A. Violin plot of the rate of CA-125 change when patients were treated (data-based resistance) against the lines of treatment in the x-axis. Each line was measured separately (i.e., the plot of line 2 is a rate of change of CA-125 during the second line of treatment). The value of data-based resistance increased as the number of lines increased (i.e., the tumor shrinkage became less negative), B. The rate of CA-125 increased when patients were off treatment (data-based aggressiveness) as a function of the number of lines of treatment. The number of lines in the x-axis indicates the last given line before the data-based aggressiveness is calculated. For example, the value for line 2 is calculated from the rate of change of the CA-125 level starting from the end of the second line to the beginning of the third line.

We conducted a multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis to examine if initial data-based resistance and data-based aggressiveness predict patient survival after completing the second-line treatment. Patients who exhibited lower data-based resistance during the first two lines of treatment and those with lower data-based aggressiveness after the first line of treatment had better survival rates (Fig 3 and S3 Fig).

Mathematical modeling

The time course data for CA-125 reveal the presence of three broad dynamic patterns. In the first pattern, CA-125 fluctuates with treatments, decreasing during each line of therapy and increasing between lines. In the second pattern, CA-125 decreases during the initial treatment and increases thereafter, with the initial decrease likely because of the effects of surgery but with a lack of response to chemotherapy due to primary resistance. In the third pattern, CA-125 levels remain low after the initial line of treatment, which may indicate the presence of highly chemosensitive tumors and/or a long-lasting effect of surgery (S4 Fig).

Fitting mathematical models to clinical data using all-line fitting

When applying all-line fitting to the 791 HGSOC patients, the SR model with initial treatment-resistant cells (the SR and R0 model), the SR model with the transition from treatment-sensitive cells to treatment-resistant cells (the SR and μ model), and the adaptive dynamics model (the AD model) capture the dynamics of CA-125 levels equally well when all data points were incorporated into the fitting process. (S4 Fig). Compared with the smoothed function using the ratio of sum of the square error (Eq 11), the goodness of fit of all three multiple-cell models (the SR and R0 model, the SR and μ model, and the AD model) are not significantly different from each other, and all are less than 1 (p < 0.0001). In contrast, the single cell-type model gave the worst fit to the clinical data. The ratio is 0.666±0.364 for the SR and μ model, 0.660±0.369 for the SR and R0 model, 0.713±0.388 for the adaptive dynamics model, and 0.238±0.239 for the single cell type (Fig 4A). We evaluated the goodness of fit using the R2. The average R2 values for the models are as follows: 0.834 ± 0.181 for the SR and μ model, 0.834 ± 0.194 for the SR and R0 model, 0.837 ± 0.196 for the Adp model, and 0.427 ± 0.774 for the Single cell model (Fig 4B). Similarly, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values are consistent, showing no significant difference between the three models with two cell types (Fig 4C). Due to its inferior performance, we exclude the single-cell type model from further analysis. The current model operates under a fixed initial condition, C(0). However, by treating the initial condition as an additional parameter, there is no notable impact on the model’s fitting capabilities (S5 Fig).

The multiple-cell type models estimated the growth rate of treatment-sensitive (γS) and treatment-resistant cells (γR) in the absence of treatment, the death rate of treatment-sensitive cells (δS) and treatment-resistant cells (δR) during lines of treatment, and the initial population of treatment-resistant cells (R(0)) (Table 3). We estimate models parameters individually for each patient. Across individuals, the estimated growth and death rates are positively correlated for both sensitive (γS and δS) and resistant cells (γR and δR). This positive correlation suggests a trade-off between resistance and aggressiveness. We observe no significant correlation of the model-estimated growth rates of sensitive and resistant cells. The model-estimated initial population of treatment-resistant cells positively correlates with their associated death rate, the growth rate of sensitive cells, and the death rate of sensitive cells. Additionally, the model-estimated initial population of treatment-resistant cells negatively correlates with their growth rate. Similar results with the SR and μ model and the Adp model, with additional information on the correlation of parameters from the other models in the S6 Fig.

Summary and correlations of parameter estimates across patients using the SR model with initial treatment-resistant cells. Italics indicates significance at p < 0.05 and bold p < 0.0001.

Parameter estimates across patients showed significant variance (Fig 5). We inferred the death rate of treatment-resistant cells to be significantly lower than the death rate of treatment-sensitive cells (δS > δR and p < 0.001 with paired t-test). We found that the model-estimated aggressiveness was lower in treatment-resistant cells (γS > γR with a p < 0.0001 with paired t-test and Fig 5A). The model-estimated resistance (death rate) of treatment-resistant cells was negative for 80% of all patients, indicating that these cells continued to grow during treatment (Fig 5B). However, this inequality holds for only 59% of patients (p < 0.001 with a chi-squared test).

We then assessed whether the estimated parameters could predict survivorship by categorizing patients into groups with parameter values above and below the median. Clinical covariates were not included in this initial analysis. Patients had more prolonged survival with less model-estimated aggressiveness in treatment-sensitive cells (small γS increased median survival by 237 days), less model-estimated aggressiveness in treatment-resistant cells (small γR increased median survival by 319.5 days), or lower model-estimated resistance in treatment-resistant cells (larger δR increased median survival by 216 days), with no effect of model-estimated resistance in treatment-sensitive cells (δS), (Figs 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F and 6).

The death and growth rates of sensitive and treatment-resistant cells were estimated using all-line fitting with the SR and R0 model. N represents the number of patients used in the multivariate Cox regression. All patients with missing data for any variable were excluded from the analysis. The PDS in first-line treatment includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and primary debulking surgery (PDS).

Next, we analyzed multivariate Cox regression by including the estimated parameters and clinical covariates. The survival outcomes after the second line of therapy were significantly influenced by multiple factors, including parameters estimated from mathematical models and clinical covariates. The resistance observed in the first-line therapy from clinical data, the post-first-line therapy aggressiveness based on clinical data, the pre-treatment levels of CA-125 measured from clinical data, the growth rates of treatment-resistant (γR) and treatment-sensitive cells (γS), the death rate of treatment-resistant cells (δR), age at diagnosis, and the specific type of first-line treatment, all exhibited statistically significant impacts on patient survival after finishing the second line of therapy (Fig 6). Patients with a higher estimated death rate of treatment-resistant cells have higher survivorship (Fig 6 and Hazard ratio = 0.74). The initial population of treatment-resistant cells estimated from the mathematical model, (R(0) showed no statistically significant impact on survivorship.

Fitting of mathematical models to clinical data using two-line fitting

Given that the multiple-cell type models (the SR and R0 model, the SR and μ model, and the AD model) accurately capture the entire CA-125 data set and provide parameter estimates that predict survivorship, we tested whether parameters estimated with two-line fitting, three-line fitting, and four-line fitting could predict the trajectory of the future dynamic of CA-125 levels in the short and long run. The model accurately fits these subsets of the data (Fig 7A). However, the model fails to accurately predict future data. Specifically, the coefficient of determination (R2) for the subsequent treatment line, referred to as “R-squared next line” (Fig 7B), as well as for all subsequent data points that were not used for model fitting, referred to as “R-squared all later lines”, were negative for all three models (Fig 7C), although they improve as we progressively include a greater number of treatment lines in the parameter estimation (Fig 7B and 7C).

Box plot showing R2 of predictions of A. the data used for model fitting B. the next line after the last fitted line and C. all the lines after the last fitted line using two-line fitting, three-line fitting, and four-line fitting.

Fitting only the first two lines predicted survivorship, with better survival for patients with low γR, low γS, and high δR (p < 0.001 and Fig 8). Reduced aggressiveness of both sensitive and resistant cells and a low level of resistance in resistant cells contributes to enhanced patient outcomes. As with all-line fitting, δS has no statistically significant effect on survival outcomes. The difference in the median survival between patients with high and low values of these parameters was similar to those found by all-line fitting. By considering the clinical covariates from the data with the estimated parameters from the mathematical models, we found that patients with a low growth rate of treatment-resistant cells and a higher death rate of treatment-resistant cells had a better chance of survival (Fig 9). The results from three-line fitting and four-line fitting provide similar results (S1 File).

The initial CA-125 is the CA-125 level before first-line treatment. The first-line treatment includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and primary debulking surgery (PDS). Age at Diagnosis, the treatment in the first line, and residual disease can be found in the data set. N represents the number of patients used in the multivariate Cox regression. Patients with any missing variables were excluded from the analysis.

Discussion

This study used statistical analysis and mathematical modeling to investigate the dynamics of CA-125 levels in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. We found that the decline in CA-125 levels during treatment slowed with additional lines of treatment. This suggests the emergence of chemoresistance, reduced responsiveness of cancer cells to chemotherapy over time. In order to investigate the evolution of chemoresistance, we formulated and fitted mathematical models of the dynamics of CA-125 and predict patient survival.

We addressed four main issues. First, we found that simple models with two cancer cell types and two traits, resistance (rate of decline during therapy) and aggressiveness (rate of growth between lines of therapy), could successfully capture the dynamics of CA-125 levels in most HGSOC patients. By considering the interplay between resistance and aggressiveness, these models provide insight into the dynamic of cancer cells during and between lines of therapy. Models where treatment-resistant cells existed before the beginning of the treatment and those where treatment-resistant cells emerged over time fit the data equally well. Second, a model using adaptive dynamics, in which the cell state varies along a continuum, fits the data as well as ordinary differential equations with two fixed sensitive and treatment-resistant cell populations. Third, statistical analysis showed that patients with good surgical outcomes, a rapid decline in CA-125 levels during first-line therapy, and slow growth after first-line therapy had the best survival. The models predict survival and significantly improve upon survivorship models that use only empirical data. In particular, when using information from the first two lines of treatment, patients with a low estimated growth rate of treatment-resistant cells survived on average 342 days longer than patients with a high estimated growth rate. Similarly, patients with a low estimated growth rate of treatment-sensitive cells survived on average 271 days longer than patients with a high estimated growth rate. Patients with high estimated rates of treatment-resistant cell death have a significant median survival of 262 days more than patients with low estimated death rates for these treatment-resistant cells. This finding implies a pivotal role of treatment-resistant cell characteristics for patient outcomes. The inferred death rate of the treatment-sensitive cells during treatment did not predict survival. Although, our models accurately fit the data and predict survivorship. the models fail to predict the future dynamics of CA-125 levels, both in the short term and over an extended time frame, whether based on two-line fitting, three-line fitting, or four-line fitting. Although the models performs better when initially fitted with more lines of treatment, the predictive power never exceeds that of a null model. Practically, this means that simple models can characterize the status of resistance in individual patients even though they cannot accurately predict the future trajectory of disease.

Our mathematical models do not include multiple factors that affect the dynamics of CA-125 and the long-term survival of HGSOC patients, such as primary surgery, residual disease after primary surgery, and the normalization of the CA-125 levels. Future studies are need to show whether additional variables can improve predictions of future CA-125 levels and the survival outcomes of HGSOC patients. According to our statistical analysis, these factors affect overall patient survival and CA-125 levels before the next line of treatment. We also did not include the effects of phenotypic plasticity [8], which could provide a much more rapid way for tumors to develop chemoresistance.

The current models do not incorporate differences among therapeutic agents used to treat HGSOC, and thus effectively assume complete cross-resistance. The most common drugs used in this study included the platinum drugs carboplatin and cisplatin, and a range of other agents, including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, bevacizumab, cyclophosphamide, and PARP inhibitors. Each type of drug has a distinct mechanism of action. Future work will include the specific drug types, the use of drug combinations, and the possibility of partial cross-resistance. This expanded scope of investigation aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities of CA-125 level surrounding HGSOC treatment and to inform more precise and effective therapeutic approaches in the future.

Our models reveal differences in resistance and aggressiveness across patients with HGSOC. By linking these phenotypes with genetic data on individuals, these mathematical models will help to identify the mechanisms underlying these differences and provide targets for treatment. In this intricate web of genetic variations and clinical parameters, the models serve as our guiding compass, helping us navigate the treacherous terrain of HGSOC. They allow us to explore the intricate interplay between genetic mutations, signaling pathways, and the tumor microenvironment, unraveling the complex mechanisms that underlie resistance and aggressiveness. These insights become the foundation for designing targeted therapies that aim to disrupt the processes that sustain resistance or curb the aggressive growth of the tumor.

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Authors:

Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.

Reviewer #1: Attached.

Reviewer #2: • I can’t find the units of growth/death rate – have these been reported? I would appreciate a table of parameters (units, values, brief description) for the ODE models.

• Authors appear to assume exponential growth in both ODE models (e.q's 3-5), could authors justify this choice or else check results are not affected by using another model (e.g. logistic). As a general point, it is not clear whether the authors have used existing models (i.e. from citations 32,35,36,38), whether existing models have been modified, or if the models presented here are entirely new. I would like to see more explicit comparison of similarities/differences with existing models and justification of any differences.

• Both AD and SR models assume zero tumor growth during treatment, which seems unrealistic (especially for resistant cells). Indeed in Fig. S4B it does look like tumors progress during treatment intervals. Given the large data-set, it should be possible to estimate the parameter alpha directly from the data.

• I can find no legend/description of the vertical colored bars in Figs 1, S2, & S4.

• I would like to see some discussion about what is considered to be “on treatment” in the model. As an example, in Fig. S4B there are vertical blue bars which I presume represent treatment intervals. In the model is it assumed that patients are “off treatment” during the small intervals between these blue bars, or is the patient considered to be “on treatment” throughout? What about S4B yellow bars, where the time intervals are much longer?

• I am not convinced about the robustness of the authors parameter estimation procedure. E.g. Fig. S4C single cell model fit looks very poor, it seems the data could be fit much better with a horizontal line (which the model structure does not preclude). Evidence that authors had taken steps to find global optima during parameter estimation (e.g. by performing repeated fits with different initial parameter guesses) would help assuage these doubts.

• On line 312 authors write “There was no relationship between the estimated growth or death rates of sensitive and resistant cells”. This would be an interesting finding since the presence of a fitness cost of resistance is an open question with therapeutic relevance (see e.g. Gatenby & Brown, 2018). Moreover it does look like there might be a negative correlation in Fig. 5A. Authors should state which correlation coefficient they have used – would different coefficients give different results?

• Authors model selection approach is non-standard & doesn’t take into account the number of estimated parameters. Why not use e.g. AIC/BIC? Moreover it is not clear why one particular model variant was chosen for Figs 6-8 and the others are relegated to the supplement.

• In the supplementary file a figure reference appears to be missing “(the result is presented in the paper, Fig. ??)”.

• Authors concede in the discussion that their model neglects differences between different types of therapeutic agent. It would be useful to have more information about what treatments patients received (a Sankey diagram might be a good visual representation of this). If there are some treatment combinations with enough patients, it would be interesting to see how accuracy of model predictions for future response depend on treatment combination.

Reviewer #3: Overview

In this work, the authors evaluate and investigate chemoresistance in ovarian cancer patients and predict treatment effectiveness based on individual characteristics analysed from the data (using a mathematical model of log-slope).

Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) levels were measured in 791 patient with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). They evaluated the effectiveness of different mathematical models of treatment sensitive and treatment resistant cancer cells (ODEs, AD) and fit to the HGSOC data and captured the CA-125 level. They Found that patients with log growth rates of treatment-sensitive cells and treatment-resistant cells and a high death rate of treatment resistant cells have longer survival

I have a few comments below around clarity of some explanations and suggestions for delving further into the data/model predictions. Overall, I think this is an interesting study.

Major

• The authors mention that they calculate the “data-based aggressiveness as the slope of the log-transformed CA-125 level changing when patients were not receiving therapy”

o can the authors comment on how this (and the data-based resistance measure) were confirmed to be a good measure to quantify the data?

o In between treatment lines it seems for the data shown that there is a decrease then increase, how is this captured in the single measurement? If the slope changes between the lines of treatment, how is this captured?

o I’d be curious to see what other measures might provide more or different information than what is captured in Fig 2. It seems there are very long tails for the predicted slopes, why is this?

• Can the authors comment on the reasons for delta_R not constrained to being positive? In theory it means when the drug is on, we can have growth of resistant cells be represented by this death term. I think some comment around this is necessary for the reader.

• In the data in Fig 1E, it is clear there can be a decline after treatment line ends and then eventually an increase. In the model, treatment on or off is controlled by alpha = 0 or 1. This means when the treatment line ends that alpha = 0 and we should only have growth of both population (as the delta terms should be zero) but the data doesn’t seem to depict this, can the authors explain whether this means Eq (3) and (4) don’t match data that looks like Fig 2? Or what might be causing a decline after treatment line ends that is captured in their model.

• I think the correlations across patients is very interesting and could be dug into further and moved into the main text (Table S1). e.g.

o does the minimum CA-125 between lines correlate to longer term survival?

o if you only estimate the slope post minimum between lines, does this provide a better indicator of resistance?

o Does aggressive ness and resistance at each line correlate for individual patients.

o Is there a correlation between parameter values or data values and the style of treatment (length of line? Or treatment type?)

• It would be interesting to see whether of the “three general dynamical patterns” one model fits one better, instead of just looking at all data fits per model today (Fig 4)

Minor

• I’m not sure if this is a typo but I’m unfamiliar with the name of a study being in the author list: “Australian Ovarian Cancer Study”, should that be in the author list?

• The introduction feels lacking in references to previous mathematical works modelling ovarian cancer resistance. I encourage the authors to make a small addition to the introduction mentioning previous models of Ovarian cancer treatment or of cancer resistance modelling. It allows the readers to contextualise this work and understand it’s advantages over previous models that may be available. I see they add some references, but the discussion around these and the breadth of these references feels lacking

• The figures are quite pixelated in the version I’m seeing – could this be fixed for publication

• Can more information be given on the treatments, the authors mention “first-line”, “second-line” etc but it’s not explained what this means, in particular:

o Was each first, second etc line treatment the same for each patient

o How long are these line treatments? E.g. one a day for 7 days? How heterogeneous is this across the cohort of patients?

• Can the authors explain their mixed-effects linear regression fitting process in more detail? They reference using R, can the code please be provided (even for a synthetic dataset). They explain a least-squares fitting more in detail but mention the mixed-effects model earlier.

• Typo in Fig S4 caption “/mu”

• Can the corresponding pair-parameter plots to Fig 5A and B be given to see what the other pair correlations are (if any)

• How was c1 and c2 in (1) estimated? How do they feed into the model?

• I find the reference to the three types of models a bit confusing, while there is a paragraph explaining it on the bottom of Pg 17 it would be helpful to have a diagram or shorter names. In addition the caption to Fig 4 should explain the meaning of the horizontal axis model names again for the reader.

• Sometimes the authors say “Supplementary Fig. 4” and sometimes just S4, I’d be consistent throughout

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Authors:

Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.

Reviewer #1: Thank you for your responses to my concerns. While the paper has significantly improved, there remain issues regarding the robustness of the model fitting process.

Specifically, there are conflicting points in the text regarding the model fits to the data. Lines 239-240 state that when the “ratio approaches 1, the model aligns closely with the observed data.” However, the ratios shown in Figure 4 show that they are closer to 0.5, meaning that the RSS_model is higher than the RSS_sup. In fact, lines 344-345 state that the ratios (for all but the single state model) are “all significantly less than 1,” which would imply that the models aren’t able to describe the data. The fits shown in Figure S4 also lend to this point, especially in the long term in panel B. Panel C of Figure S4 also show that the SR and R0 and adaptive dynamics models cannot describe these types of CA-125 dynamics, as their curves are more or less constant despite CA-125 changing throughout the treatment cycles.

Additionally, from the distributions of the model-estimated aggressiveness and resistance parameters shown in Figure 5, it appears that the aggressiveness and/or resistance parameters are 0 for many patients. This implies that the optimizer did not converge and instead went to the lower bound. That is likely the case for the fits shown in Figure S4C. If both aggressiveness and resistance rates are 0, then CA-125 might initially drop during the first treatment cycle, but then remain constant once treatment is turned off (which is what we’re seeing in Figure S4C). This lends to the idea that the model is not appropriate for these types of patient data. A global optimization needs to be done to ensure that the models are not collapsing at their bounds.

Finally, please include the goodness of fit values (or R^2) for each model for the fits shown in Fig S4. (And maybe even consider including different patients, as the current fits do not describe the data very well.) The R^2 values shown in Figure 7A for 4 lines of therapy are more convincing that the models can accurately describe the data. I’d be curious to see the R^2 values over all lines of the data.

Reviewer #2: Modifications in the revised manuscript have increased clarity and improved the manuscript overall. However, my concerns about the parameter estimation process and protocol for model comparison were not addressed. Since the estimated parameters values are important for the conclusions of the paper, steps should be taken to demonstrate the robustness of the parameter estimates.

“The model output with all parameters set to 0 would remain at the initial condition and provide a poor fit.”

This response highlights a flaw in the fitting procedure, namely that the initial level of CA-125 was apparently not included as a parameter to be estimated. Instead all fits seem to be constrained to pass through the first data point, which has the undesirable effect of overstating the importance of the first data point. The impact of this constraint on the results can most clearly be seen in figure S4B, where the gradient of the line is much steeper than it would be had the fit been unconstrained at the first timepoint.

I struggle to believe the claim (regarding the yellow line in figure S4B) that “the horizontal line does not fit better in the current model”, because the yellow line is simply so far from the data points. It could be the case that the fit appears worse than it actually is, because the fitting was performed on non log-transformed data whilst the plot displays log-transformed data (which if true, should be indicated on the plot y axis or in the legend). However even then I have difficulty imagining that a horizontal line would provide a worse fit, particularly if the initial condition is fitted as a parameter as it ought to be.

“In the present study, our primary objective is to assess and compare the predictive performance of each mathematical model rather than focusing on selecting the most appropriate model.”

Even if the goal is to compare but not select a model, common model selection criteria (AIC, cross validation) are a widely used and accepted basis for comparing models. Two criticisms of the current method of comparison are 1) does not take into account model complexity, and 2) uses the super smoother as a benchmark for model performance. The super smoother is itself a nonparametric model of the data, so it seems very strange to benchmark the parametric models against this other nonparametric model rather than simply against the data itself. If there was some compelling reason to use this approach rather than standard criteria, I cannot find it in the text. It would be helpful if the authors could point to instances in the literature where this approach has been used for model comparison before. This approach should be much better motivated or else replaced with a more suitable alternative.

Reviewer #3: Thank you for your revision of your manuscript. I have four remaining comments.

1. In my previous review (Major 1.2 and 1.3), I commented on the miss-match between the data and the model after the first and second treatment line. The authors said they attempted to fit the changing slope using a fixed delay and it made no difference to their ability to fit the model, however, this still concerns me as there is a clear decrease post first and second line treatment in Fig S2 and Fig 1A that contrasts with what is modelled. Potentially, this isn't common across the patients, and maybe that should be included in the text. Either way, I think a more detailed explanation in the text is needed about why this isn't important and the results of attempting to change the model to match it for clarity for the audience. If the details have already been added, can the line numbers be pointed out.

Have the authors examined fixing the delay to be the turning point in the patient data? I'd be interested into why this wouldn't give a better fit to the data.

2. Also, can the authors please add the details in their responses to my questions in the round 1 revision to the text. In particular,

• Comment Major 4 – can the authors add to the text their analysis of the correlations between variables and significance/non-significance of these relationships

• Comment Minor 4 – give more details of the range seen for timing and schedule of dose lines across patients

• Comment Minor 5 – add “R with lm and lme4” for transparency and reproducibility.

3. I do not understand the authors answer to Minor 7, can they please provide either further explanation of their response or re-examine my question. Pointing out line numbers would also help.

4. Having a Fig S2 and a Fig S2 in the SI is confusing. Please changing the names of the figures in the SI to something else e.g. Fig SI2.
