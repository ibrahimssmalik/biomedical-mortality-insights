This systematic review examines the proportion and quality of postrecurrence treatment among patients in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registration trials of anticancer therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.

Key Points

Question

How often is postrecurrence treatment reported in adjuvant and neoadjuvant oncology randomized clinical trials, and what is the access to optimal postrecurrence treatment?

Findings

In this systematic review of 14 US Food and Drug Administration registration trials of systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting from 2018 to 2023, postrecurrence treatment was not reported in 43% of trials. Overall, 14% of trials had data assessed as appropriate.

Meaning

The findings suggest that regulatory rules should enforce stricter requirements regarding postrecurrence treatment access and reporting in trials.

Importance

In oncology randomized clinical trials, suboptimal access to best available care at recurrence (or relapse) may affect overall survival results.

Objective

To assess the proportion and the quality of postrecurrence treatment received by patients enrolled in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registration trials of systemic therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting.

Evidence Review

For this systematic review, all trials leading to an FDA approval from January 2018 through May 2023 were obtained from the FDA website and drug announcements. Randomized clinical trials of an anticancer drug in the neoadjuvant or the adjuvant setting were included. Trials of supportive care treatment and treatments given in combination with radiotherapy were excluded. Information abstracted for each trial included tumor type, setting, phase, type of sponsor, reporting and assessment of postrecurrence, and overall survival data.

Findings

A total of 14 FDA trials met the inclusion criteria. Postrecurrence data were not available in 6 of 14 registration trials (43%). Of the 8 remaining trials, postrecurrence treatment was assessed as suboptimal in 6 (75%). Overall, only 2 of 14 trials (14%) had data assessed as appropriate.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review found that 43% of randomized clinical trials of anticancer treatment in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant context failed to present any assessable postrecurrence treatment data. In instances in which these data were shared, postrecurrence treatment was suboptimal 75% of the time. The findings suggest that regulatory bodies should enforce rules stipulating that patients have access to the best standard of care at recurrence.
==== Body
pmcIntroduction

In patients with cancer undergoing curative local treatment, neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic therapies aim to lower recurrences, increase cure rates, or permit less invasive surgery. Increasing cure rate applies to the whole population because some patients benefit from additional therapy while others do not, and many experience adverse effects. Patients who benefit are a minority of treated patients.1

All drugs used in the adjuvant context could also be prescribed in metastatic settings.2 Therefore, the question in adjuvant setting is whether to treat all patients earlier despite many not benefiting or to only treat at recurrence. A valid answer is obtained if patients who have recurrence in the control arm have optimal access to therapeutic options, including drugs tested in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting when indicated. We aimed to evaluate the reporting and characteristics of postrecurrence therapy in trials leading to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registration of systemic therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment setting.

Methods

In this systematic review, we sought to identify all randomized clinical trials of anticancer treatment in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting leading to a marketing authorization (from January 2018 through May 2023). Searches of the FDA website and drug announcements were performed on June 10, 2023.3 Trials of supportive treatments and pediatric trials were excluded, as were trials of therapies given in combination with radiotherapy. We abstracted trial, postrecurrence, and overall survival (OS) data.

We evaluated postrecurrence data using prespecified rules with the same principles as in a previous work.4 The first rule assessed the type of therapy that patients received at disease recurrence and was met when less than 10% of patients receiving systemic therapy at disease recurrence were deprived from a therapy already proven to be a preferred beneficial option, considered the standard of care (eMethods in Supplement 1). The second rule assessed crossover and was satisfied when no more than 10% of control patients receiving systemic treatment after relapse received the experimental drug if the drug’s efficacy in later stages was not yet proven. The third rule assessed the overall access to any therapy at recurrence. This rule was fulfilled when the number of patients receiving any treatment after disease recurrence was at least 10% higher in trials than outside trials (eResults 2 in Supplement 1). Since first recurrence may be amenable to local treatment, we did not restrict the assessment of the third rule to systemic therapy only. Additional details are described in the eMethods in Supplement 1.

Statistical Analysis

Frequencies were calculated for categorical variables. R, version 4.1.2 (R Foundation) was used for statistical analysis.

Results

Of 272 FDA approvals, 14 trials5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 met the inclusion criteria (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). All trials were industry-sponsored phase 3 trials leading to regular approvals. Other trial characteristics are described in Table 1.

Of 14 trials, 6 (43%)8,10,11,16,17,18 did not report any postrecurrence data. Of 8 trials with reported data,5,6,7,9,12,13,14,15 overall treatment was assessed as suboptimal in 6 (75%) (Table 2 and eResults 1 in Supplement 1). Among those 6 trials, in 1 trial,14 data were reported in aggregate and we could not exclude that the systemic treatment received at recurrence was optimal; however, the overall access to any therapy at recurrence was assessed as suboptimal. In the 2 trials (14%)6,7 coded with an overall optimal postrecurrence care, data were presented in aggregate; we could not rule out that treatment was optimal. The Figure shows the proportion of patients who received preferred treatments among patients who received any systemic therapy at recurrence in those trials. No trials used inappropriate crossover. Of the 2 trials5,16 with a significant OS benefit, 1 trial5 reported subpar postrecurrence data and the other16 did not report any postrecurrence data. Other postprogression and OS data are reported in Table 2.

Figure. Proportion of Patients Who Received Standard of Care Among Patients Who Received Systemic Therapy at Disease Recurrence in 8 Trials With Postrecurrence Data

Standard of care treatments (preferred treatments) used for each trial are detailed in the eResults 1 in Supplement 1. A detailed explanation of estimates is provided in the eMethods in Supplement 1. The dotted line corresponds to a prespecified rule that at least 90% of patients receiving systemic therapy at recurrence should receive an optimal therapy. CM indicates CheckMate; KN, KEYNOTE.

bMaximum estimate.

Discussion

This systematic review found that postrecurrence treatment was either not reported or reflected suboptimal care in most trials leading to an FDA approval of systemic therapies in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting between 2018 and 2023. This is consistent with a previous finding in advanced disease in which only 12% of FDA registration trials had available postprogression data assessed as optimal.4

To evaluate postprotocol therapy, we assessed 2 questions. One is whether control arm participants who received treatment at the time of relapse received the best available care. We found that most trials with assessable data reported subpar therapy. For example, in the ADAURA trial,5 38.5% of patients who presented with a recurrence (excluding death) received osimertinib, which has been the standard of care since the FLAURA trial.19 Even when considering only patients receiving systemic therapy at relapse, only 48.8% received osimertinib (maximum estimate).5

Another question was related to the overall access to any subsequent therapy in both arms. In optimal care situations, a disease-free survival (DFS) benefit may be diluted by subsequent therapy.20 Conversely, in places where access to subsequent treatment is limited, a DFS benefit is more likely to translate into an OS benefit because fewer options are available after recurrence.

In the IMpower010 trial,21 patients with resected stage IB (≥4-cm tumor) to IIIA non–small cell lung cancer were randomized to adjuvant atezolizumab or best supportive care. Of patients presenting a recurrence in the control arm, 67% of them received a systematic treatment. However, in the general population, 77% of patients with stage II to IIIA disease who presented with a recurrence received a subsequent systemic therapy.22 In contrast to the lower percentage of people who received subsequent therapy in the IMpower010 trial than in the general population, we believe that this percentage should be higher in trials because stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria in trials select for patients with better health and fewer comorbidities.23 Clinical data as a benchmark can be suboptimal due to issues like poor generalizability; however, no trial in the present study was considered to be suboptimal based solely on this aspect.

In the 2 trials5,16 showing a significant OS benefit, none reported optimal postrecurrence care. However, postrecurrence data are vital in interpreting downstream end points like second progression-free survival or OS. While event-free survival or DFS have historically been considered surrogate markers for clinical efficacy, their direct clinical relevance as stand-alone end points remains under debate.24,25 For patients who value their time without treatment or who value a survival benefit, positive OS results may be poorly informed in the context of suboptimal postrelapse therapy. Because a small proportion of patients receiving perioperative therapy ultimately benefit, discussing treatment goals with patients is critical.1

Our findings add to other issues like high costs26 and the risk of bias in quality-of-life results.27 Regulators could restrict enrollment to countries with optimal care access. However, this would impair the diverse representation of patients in trials and deepen inequality regarding access to innovation worldwide. Alternatively, they could mandate sponsor-funded crossover at recurrence when the best available therapy is known. We also propose illustrations of postrecurrence data, when available, to aid in shared decision-making (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1).

Strengths and Limitations

This study has strengths. First, to our knowledge, it is the first comprehensive evaluation of postrecurrence data in the perioperative settings of cancer treatment. Second, our method has been used in other contexts (advanced and metastatic settings), ensuring consistency. This study also has limitations. We did not have access to individual patient data, thus limiting a full assessment of postprogression data; however, our conservative categorization leaned toward overestimating the quality of postrecurrence therapies rather than underestimating it.

Conclusions

This systematic review found that 43% of randomized clinical trials of anticancer treatment in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant context failed to present any assessable postrecurrence treatment data. In instances in which these data were shared, postrecurrence treatment was suboptimal 75% of the time. The findings suggest that regulatory bodies should enforce rules stipulating that patients have access to the best standard of care at recurrence in global trials.
