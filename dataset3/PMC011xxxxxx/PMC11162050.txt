In this article the wrong figure appeared as Figs. 6 and 8.; the figures should have appeared as shown below.

The original article has been corrected.

Fig. 6 Correlation coefcients between the traits in Iranian wheat cultivars and landraces. Lodged area (LA), crop angle of inclination (CAI), lodging score index (LS), plant height (PH), number of nodes (NFN), peduncle length (PL), penultimate length (Pel), internode length 1 (IL1), internode length 2 (IL2), peduncle diameter (PD), penultimate diameter (PeD), internode diameter 1 (ID1), internode diameter 2 (ID2), days to heading (DTH), days to fowering (DTF), days to maturity (DTM), spike weight (SW), spike area (SA) and grain yield (GY)

Fig. 8 Hierarchical clustering and heatmap of Iranian wheat landraces and cultivars based on the wheat traits. Lodged area (LA), crop angle of inclination (CAI), lodging score index (LS), plant height (PH), number of nodes (NFN), peduncle length (PL), penultimate length (Pel), internode length 1 (IL1), internode length 2 (IL2), peduncle diameter (PD), penultimate diameter (PeD), internode diameter 1 (ID1), internode diameter 2 (ID2), days to heading (DTH), days to fowering (DTF), days to maturity (DTM), spike weight (SW), spike area (SA) and grain yield (GY)
