Background

Depression is a severe and treatable mental illness that significantly affects individuals’ daily activities. Obstetric care providers are the most vulnerable group for depression because they work in an emergency to save two lives at a time, share the stress of women during labor, and are at great risk for contamination.

Objectives

To assess depression and associated factors among obstetric care providers working in public health facilities.

Method and materials

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 obstetric care providers working in public health facilities found in the West Arsi Zone, Ethiopia, from June 1 to 30, 2023. Study participants were selected through a simple random sampling technique. A pretested, face-to-face interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to identify factors associated with depression. The level of statistical significance was declared at P < 0.05 with a 95% CI.

Conclusions and results

Overall, the prevalence of depression among obstetric care providers was 31.1% (95% CI: 26.6%, 35.5%). Marital status not in union (AOR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.66, 4.94), working more than 40 hours per week (AOR = 2.21, 95%CI: 1.23, 3.75), current substance use (AOR = 2.73, 95%CI: 1.64, 4.56), not being satisfied with their job (AOR = 3.52, 95%CI: 2.05, 6.07) and having burnout symptoms (AOR = 5.11, 95%CI: 2.95, 8.83) were factors significantly associated with depression.

Recommendations

We recommend that health professionals take care of themselves and avoid substance use. We also recommended that stakeholders enhance job satisfaction and avoid burnout by implementing various programs, like raising wages for workers, increasing staff members, offering various benefits, and regularly monitoring issues that arise.

Depression is a severe and treatable mental illness that negatively affects an individual’s feelings, the way he or she thinks, and how they act. If it can’t be managed early, it can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and increase disability to function at the workplace and home [1]. Depressive disorder is yet an underappreciated mental disorder in the population, which is manifested by depressed symptoms including mood or loss of pleasure or interest in any activities that one’s individual performs in his or her daily life [2–4].

Depression is quite different from ordinary mood changes or a feeling that happens to an individual due to his or her daily life situation [5]. Instead, it can affect all aspects of an individual’s life, including relationships with family, friends, and society. Depression can happen to anyone; exceptionally, people who have a previous or current history of abuse, severe losses, or other stressful events are more likely to develop depression [6]. There are a lot of causes of depression among them job-related factors such as emergency activities, work hours, workload, challenges with daily activities, relationship with colleagues, and access to paid leave impact the well-being of workers, their families, and their communities [7].

Worldwide healthcare workers (HCWs) are classified among the high-risk groups to develop mental health disorders [8]. More specifically, studies have shown that they experience high levels of psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, and poor sleep quality due to their daily activities related to their profession [9, 10]. The common reason that healthcare providers have these disorders is that most of the time they perform their job in restlessness, anger, frustration, insomnia, and fatigue situations [9].

Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) report revealed that nearly 280 million general populations suffer from depression [11], which might include healthcare providers. An umbrella review that included 110 studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that 24.83% of healthcare providers suffered from depression [12]. In high-income countries, depression among healthcare providers ranged from 21.53% to 32.77% [10, 13]. In Africa, studies revealed the largest magnitude of depression among healthcare providers, which ranges from 27.8% to 54.5% [14, 15].

Almost all organ systems are affected by depression, including the cardiovascular, kidney, gastrointestinal, nervous, and immune systems [16]. Depression is also affecting social interactions, which are the building blocks of interpersonal social networks for good functional social relationships. Individuals with depressive symptoms have a greater chance of being isolated in their social relationships, which can further increase their symptoms [17]. Furthermore, depression has an economic burden; for instance, in the United States, it cost an estimated $236 billion in 2018, an increase of more than 35% since the 2010 cost of depression disorder [18].

There are identified factors that cause depression among healthcare providers. The studies revealed that job-related factors such as marital status, sex of study participants, working hours, workload, job satisfaction, and access to paid leave were factors that led to depression among healthcare providers, which affects the well-being of workers, their families, and their communities [7, 12, 14, 19].

By 2030, depression symptoms are predicted to overtake other causes as the second largest contributor to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [20]. To overcome this problem and other mental disorders, reports from the Compressive Mental Health Action Plan 2030 aim to improve mental health by strengthening effective leadership, integrated and responsive community-based care, evidence, and research [21]. World Health Organization transforms this to mental health for all and calls on all countries to accelerate implementation of this plan [22]. However, little is known about depression among obstetric care providers in Africa, including Ethiopia.

Obstetrics care providers are highly at risk for mental health problems like depression as a result of stress, trauma, grief, and shortages of resources they face in their working environment due to the nature of the environment of their work. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression and associated factors among obstetric care providers in the West Arsi Zone in 2023.

Methodology

Study area, study design and period

The cross-sectional study was conducted among obstetrics care providers working in public health facilities found in the West Arsi zone from June 1 to 30, 2023. This zone is found in the Oromia region of southern Ethiopia. The zone has one referral hospital, two general hospitals, four primary hospitals, and 85 health centers. The data obtained from the zonal health office revealed that there were 5 gynecologists, 65 general practitioners (GPs), 567 midwives, 17 integrated emergency surgical officers (IESO), 188 nurses, and 178 health officers serving maternal and child health in those health facilities. The zone has 647,690 women in the reproductive age group and 101,558 estimated deliveries annually in 2023.

Source population

All obstetrics care providers working in public health facilities found in West Arsi zone.

Study population

A selected obstetric caregivers who were working in selected public health facilities in West Arsi Zone and found during data collection.

Eligibility criteria

Obstetrics care providers who have worked for at least six months in public health facilities located in the West Arsi zone were included in the study, whereas individuals who were on maternity leave as well as on annual leave were excluded.

Sample size determination

Sample size was calculated using a single population proportion formula by considering the following assumptions: a proportion (p) of 50%, a Z value at a 95% confidence level (Zα/2) = 1.96, and a 5% degree of precision by using n = Z2*(1−P)/d2. By substituting the in the formula, the minimum required sample size was 384 obtained. Adding a 10% non-response rate, the final sample size 423 taken. Where; n = the required sample size; z = the value of the standard normal curve score corresponding to the given confidence level = 1.96; p = proportion of population which is 50%; d = the permissible margin of error is 5%.

Sampling technique and procedure

The study was conducted among obstetric care providers found in West Arsi public health facilities. According to the zonal health bureau information, West Arsi Zone has a total of 92 public health facilities, with 1020 health care providers working in the obstetrics unit. By following the recommendations of the WHO on sampling techniques, 40% of health facilities were included in the study. So, from the total of 92 public health facilities found in the zone, thirty-seven health facilities were selected by using the lottery method. So three public hospitals namely Malka Oda General Hospsiital, Arsi Nagelle Primary Hospital, Shashashemenne Compressive Referral Hospital as well as other selected thirty four public health center found in the zone was included. The total number of healthcare providers working at an obstetric unit in selected public health facilities, which was obtained from the zonal health bureau, was 708. From similar data obtained from zonal health office those obstetric care providers were that serving selected public health facilities categorized as 456 Midwifery professional, 108 Nursing, 13 IESO, 39 General practitioners, 89 Health officers and 3 Obstetrician. Before the selection of study participants, obstetric care providers were proportionate allocations to each health facility were made. Finally, from the list, the required sample sizes of 423 obstetric care providers were selected by simple random sampling techniques.

Study variables

Dependent variable

Depression.

Independent variables

Socio-demographic variables. Age, marital status, educational status, residence religion, ethnicity, monthly income

Service, personal, social, and clinical related factors. Types of health facilities, years of service, Work hours per week, types of health professional, history of mental illness, history of chronic illness, family history of mental illness, current substance uses, job satisfaction, burnout and social support.

Operational definition

Depression

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, with their responses ranging from "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day), was used for the assessment of depressive symptoms, with a total score of nine items ranging from 0 to 27. Based on the previous study, those Obstetrics care providers who scored ≥ 10 were considered to have depression symptoms, and a code ‘1’ was given. While those who scored < 9 were considered to have no depression symptoms, and a code ‘0’ was given by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 tool [23].

Job satisfaction

The job satisfaction was categorized into five Likert scales (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). Those Obstetrics care providers were considered as satisfied with their job if they answered greater than or equal to the mean value 50% [19].

Burnout

There are 19 items to assess symptoms of burnout syndrome (19 items) that are categorized into four Likert scales 0 (never), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often), and 3 (always). The sums of the scores of the rating of the items were calculated with a total minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of Healthcare. Obstetrics care providers that scored more than 23 out of 57 were considered to have burnout symptoms [4].

Social support

Social support will be. The OSSS-3 sum score then will be operationalized into three broad categories of social support based the score as follows. Oslo Social Support Scale (OSLO) was used, and classified as 3–8 poor social support code ‘1’, 9–11 moderate social support code ‘2’, and 12–14 strong social Support code ‘3’ was given [24].

Data collection tool and procedure

A structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaires have questions to assess socio-demographic factors, service-related, personal-related, social-related, and clinical-related factors, as well as questions to assess job satisfaction, burnout, and depression. The questionnaires to assess socio-demographic factors, service-related, personal-related, social-related, and clinical-related factors were developed from previous literature. The tool to assess symptoms of burnout syndrome [4], job satisfaction [19], and social support [24] was validated in Ethiopia.

The dependent variable was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, which has nine items with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 27. This tool was validated in the Ethiopian population with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92 [14, 23]. The questionnaire was prepared in English and later translated into Afan Oromo to check the consistence of questionnaire, and English language was used for data collection. Thirty-seven bachelor’s degree data collectors and nine master’s degree supervisors were recruited for data collection. Data collection was supervised by supervisors on a daily basis.

Data quality control

To assure data quality the tool was translated from the English language to Afan Oromo, then retranslated back into English. To assure the quality of the data, a pretest was done in Arsi Zone health facilities on a sample of 10% of the sample size of obstetric care providers. Training was given to both data collectors and supervisors. The collected data was checked for completeness daily by data collectors and supervisors. Finally, data cleaning was done using SPSS 26 version software.

Data processing and analysis

Data was edited, coded, and entered into Epidata version 3.1 software. Then, the data was exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software for cleaning and further analysis. Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and percentage were determined. Some variables like depression, burnout, job satisfaction and social support were dichotomized based on the operational definitions their operational definitions. Then association between the outcome variable and each independent variable was first seen in the binary logistic regression model.

In the second step, independent variables with a p-value < 0.25 were retained and entered into the binary logistic regression model for multivariable analysis. The degree of association between outcome and independent variables was determined using the odds ratio with a CI of 95% and p-value. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered a cutoff point to declare that there is a statistically significant association between dependent and independent variables. The fitness of the model was tested by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, and the value was 0.95. Finally, the result was presented in text, table, graph, and narrative form.

Ethical consideration

Ethical clearance was obtained from Madda Walabu University, Sheshemene Campus School of Health Science Ethical Review Committee with reference number MWUSH/1426. Written consent was obtained from each study subject before data collection, and the purpose of the study was explained to the respondents. All methods were conducted following the Helsinki Declaration. Further, to protect the confidentiality of the information, names and identification were not included in the written questionnaires. During the data collection, each study subject was told that their participation would be voluntary.

Prevalence of depression among obstetric care providers in West Arsi Zone, Ethiopia 2023

This study revealed that 31.10% (95% CI: 26.6%, 35.5%) of obstetric care providers had symptoms of depression (Fig 1).

10.1371/journal.pone.0304903.g001 Fig 1 Prevalence of depression among obstetric care providers.

Factors associated with depression

Bivariable logistic regression analysis was done with a 95% CI with COR to identify candidate variables, and AOR was calculated in multivariable logistic regression. The sex of the study participants, marital status, educational status, monthly income, working hours per week, current substance use, social support, job satisfaction, and burnout were transferred to multivariable logistic regression. Finally, marital status, working hours per week, current substance use, job satisfaction, and burnout were identified as factors associated with depression (S1 Table).

The odds of having depression were 2.86 times (AOR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.66, 4.94) higher in those who had no in-union compared to those who had union in marital status. The odds of having depression among obstetric care providers serving more than 40 hours per week were 2.21 times (AOR = 2.21, 95%CI: 1.23, 3.75) higher compared to their counterparts. Current substance use is a factor that is associated with depression. The odds of depression were 2.73 times (AOR = 2.73, 95%CI: 1.64, 4.56) higher among substance users compared to non-users. Job satisfaction and burnout are other factors identified in this study.

The odds of having depression among obstetric care providers that not satisfied with their jobs were 3.52 times (AOR = 3.52, 95%CI: 2.05, 6.07) higher compared to those who were satisfied with their jobs. Lastly, the odds of depression among participants who had burnout symptoms were 5.11 times (AOR = 5.11, 95%CI: 2.95–8.83) higher than those who had no symptoms of burnout (Table 3).

Discussion

This study identified the prevalence of depression and associated factors among obstetric care providers working at public health facilities in the West Arsi Zone, Ethiopia, in 2023. As identified from this study, 31.1% of study participants had depression, and marital status, working hours per week, current substance use, job satisfaction, and burnout were identified as factors significantly associated with depression.

The result of this study is in line with the study conducted in Dessie Compressive Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia [14] which was 27.8%. This might be due to the similarity of setups in the same country. In addition, health providers get similar advantages and careers and are ruled by similar civil servant rules. Similarly, our result is consistent with the finding done in Australia [25] which was 32.4%. This might be previous study have included all health professionals with limited work load that might under estimate this problem when we compare with Obstetrics care provider.

However, the finding was lower than the study conducted among health extension workers in rural and urban areas of Ethiopia, which was 43.1% and 36.7%, respectively [26]. This discrepancy might be due to the former study was conducted among health extension workers in which due to the fact that health extension workers are serving different community at their residences and challenged by various attitude of the community, which might increase the problem. In addition, the education opportunity is not available within a short period of time that might worsen the problem.

Similarly, the finding is lower than the finding from a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in Ethiopia, which was 40% [27]. The discrepancy between a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in Ethiopia might be due to studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might increase the problem as there was a lower understanding of COVID-19 at the beginning.

However, the finding was lower than the studies conducted in Saudi Arabia [28], China [29], Hong Kong [30], Baghdad [31] and Egypt [32] which were 43.9%, 38%, 35.8%, 70.25%, and 71.4%, respectively. The possible justification might be the difference in participants who had different socio-economic and demographic characteristics in the populations as well, and the tools to assess the problem are varied.

On the other hand, the findings of our study are higher than those of the studies conducted in Vietnam [33], and Malaysia [34] which was 13.2%, and 10.7% respectively. In addition, the finding is also higher than the studies in Nigeria 10.7%, and 17.3% [35, 36]. The discrepancy might be due to differences in study participants, as our study only focused on obstetrics care providers, as the obstetrics ward is a stressful environment for them, which might worsen the problem. Similarly, the study conducted in Vietnam [33], and Malaysia [34] has included all healthcare providers, which might include healthcare providers from less stressful wards that might underestimate the problem.

The findings of the study showed that marital status is a significantly associated factor with depression, which is supported by the studies conducted in Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia [14], and systematic review conducted in Ethiopia [27], Egypt [32], Nigeria [35], Saudi Arabia [28], and Baghdad [31]. This might be because every human being in nature needs love and belongingness, so having a soul mate might prevent loneliness, which might worsen the problem. In addition, living with a spouse or partner was strongly associated with reduced odds of depression which supports the finding [37].

Working hours per week are identified as a significantly associated factor. This is supported by the studies conducted in Saudi Arabia [38], and China [29]. The possible reason might be that working overtime leads to increased work-related stress and other physical disabilities that, in the long term, have significant negative effects on mental health, specifically the chance of developing depression. In addition, working extra limits an individual’s free time for relaxation, leading to exhaustion and poor sleep, a combination that might lead to depression. On the other hand, having enough time is crucial for better relaxation, which boosts mood, reduces stress, and improves memory and focus. These benefits enable him or her to return to work with a renewed mindset.

Similarly, substance use is a significantly associated factor in this study setting. This is supported by studies conducted in Ethiopia [14], and Hong Kong [30]. This might mean that substance use may lead to mental health problems during the withdrawal period. This is strengthened by the finding that revealed substance use can trigger or intensify the feelings of loneliness, sadness, and hopelessness often associated with depressive symptoms among participants [39].

This study also identifies job satisfaction as a factor significantly associated with depression. This is in agreement with the study conducted in Southeastern Anatolia from Diyarbakir, Turkey [4]. Job satisfaction is positively correlated with collective efficacy, non-technical skills related to communication and decision-making, and a sense of belonging to their profession [40].

Lastly, burnout is a factor that is significantly associated with depression. This is supported by the studies conducted in Southeastern Anatolia from Diyarbakir, Turkey [4] and in Macao, China [41]. This might be due to a person who has burnout feeling as though “it’s never enough” and then might start to feel hopeless or lack all emotion in his or her job and be prone to depression. This is established by the fact that the link between burnout and poor mental health shows that true workplace burnout has a 57% increased risk of workplace absence and a 180% increased risk of developing depressive disorders [42].

Limitation

Due to the nature of a cross-sectional study, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship between risk factors and depression.

Conclusion

This study revealed that there was a high level of depression among the obstetric care providers in the study area. Not being in the union in terms of marital status, working more than eight hours per day, current substance use, lack of job satisfaction, and burnout were factors significantly associated with depression.

Recommendations

We recommend health professionals take care of themselves and avoid substance use. Secondly, we recommend concerned stakeholders establish mechanisms to improve job satisfaction and overcome burnout by creating different incentive mechanisms that increase staff income, increase the number of staff, provide different rewards, and conduct regular supervision of their problems. Finally, stakeholders and governments should make evidence-based decisions and ensure proper utilization of financial and human resources at health facilities.

Reviewer #1: Ms. ID 23-33519 Prevalence of Depression and Associated Factors among Obstetric Care Providers:

Cross-sectional study by Solomon Seyife et al.

The aim of this study from thirty-seven health facilities in Ethiopia was to determine the prevalence of depression and associated factors among obstetric care providers working in public health facilities..

General comments

For one month, June 1–30, 2023, a systematic random sampling technique was used to include 423 study participants among obstetrics care providers working in public health facilities. Data were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The conclusion was that the prevalence of depression among obstetric care providers was 31.1% and was associated to marital status not in union, working more than 40 hours per week, current substance use not being satisfied with their job, and having burnout symptoms. It is an important report from Ethiopia. The line number should be inserted (referred to as missing), so how can I comment on it?

Title: Prevalence of Depression and Associated Factors among Obstetric Care Providers: Cross-sectional study

Manuscript Number: PONE-D-23-33519

Review Comments

� The manuscript didn’t abide with the submission guideline of the PONE journal. E.g., the abstract section.

� The aim of the study and the scope of the recommendations are different.

� Lack of consistency through out the document i.e. Is that depression or major depressive disorder?

� The background needs critical revision and the authors should revisit how to write an introduction that convince the reader containing all essential element and entailed flawed sentences E.g. “…by the 2030 year” in the introduction section.

� The methods section lacks concise and details. In addition, the sampling technique is doubtable since the obstetric care providers have various levels E.g., Midwifery and Medical doctor. Likewise, the way the dependent variable is described, it fails to differentiate the use either ‘validated’ or ‘structured questionnaire’, this was witnessed by reference number 23. What was the type of the analysis since it is composite variable?

� The results and the discussion are relatively better. But both should be presented concisely and completely in logical way. The discussion and the explanations are sometimes against evidence. E.g., HEWs demoralized.

� Individual roles of the authors should be explained independently and in detail.

� Poor referencing E.g., Reference number 5.

� First of all, we sincerely appreciate your contribution to review of our work and your helpful suggestions. Based on AE and reviewers comments and suggestions we try to address each point as following: We also incorporated in revised document with track change and highlights.

� Response to comments and suggestions raised by Academic Editor

Response:

Regarding the PLOS One journal guideline issue, we corrected the revised document in accordance with the guideline.

Regarding issues of data availability; previously we have stated that the current manuscript is a part of undergoing research project owned by Madda Walabu University Shashemenne Campus. All relevant data are included within the paper. The data would be guarded carefully by our research team for the only purpose of this scientific study and it is an ongoing project. For this reason and following the indicators of the research review committee of college of health sciences, Madda Walabu University, the authors must not upload the dataset to a stable, public repository. Interested, qualified researchers can access the data by requesting the following concerned bodies.

The research coordinators of Madda Walabu University Shashemenne Campus Mr. Habtamu Jarso can be contacted

1. Habtemu Jarso (BSc, MPH-E, Assis. Professor)

Shashemene Campus, Madda Walabu University

Institutional email: habtemu.jarso@mwu.edu.et

2. Corresponding author; Solomon Seyife: email: SoleSeifa@gmail.com

� Beside this all necessary files have been uploaded on initial submission on the track accordingly.

The ethical statement's location was changed in accordance with your suggestion.

2. Response to comments raised by first reviewer

Please insert the line number for writing the comment line by line and resubmit again?

Response:

� We appreciate your feedback and have already incorporated it into the updated document.

3. Response to comments raised by second reviewer

1. The manuscript didn’t abide with the submission guideline of the PONE journal. E.g., the abstract section.

Response:

� Thank you very much for your suggestion; On the basis of your suggestion, a correction has been made to the updated document.

2. The aim of the study and the scope of the recommendations are different.

Response:

� Thank you very much for your suggestion. Since our study is a single study, it is not advisable to recommend policy makers; instead, it should be in line with our findings. We therefore made a correction after reevaluating our findings.

‘’ We recommend health professionals take care of themselves from substance use, just to live as exemplary for communities. Secondly, we recommend concerned stakeholders to establish mechanisms to improve job satisfaction and overcome burnout by creating different incentive mechanisms that increase staff income, increase the number of staff, provide different rewards, and conduct regular supervision of their problems. Finally, stakeholders and governments should make evidence-based decisions and ensure proper utilization of financial and human resources at health facilities.”

3. Lack of consistency throughout the document i.e. is that depression or major depressive disorder?

Response:

our study is focused on depression. So, we carefully revised the document and made correction in revised document.

4. The background needs critical revision and the authors should revisit how to write an introduction that convince the reader containing all essential element and entailed flawed sentences E.g. “…by the 2030 year” in the introduction section.

Response:

� Thank you very much for your suggestion after revising this section we try to rewrite it for instance based on your recommendation we corrected line number 113.

‘’By 2030, depression symptoms are predicted to overtake other causes as the second largest contributor to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).’’

5. The methods section lacks concise and details. In addition, the sampling technique is doubtable since the obstetric care providers have various levels E.g., Midwifery and Medical doctor. Likewise, the way the dependent variable is described, it fails to differentiate the use either ‘validated’ or ‘structured questionnaire’, this was witnessed by reference number 23. What was the type of the analysis since it is composite variable?

Response:

Issue of methodology

Having carefully reviewed the document, we made the necessary corrections.

With respect to the sampling method, refer to lines 156–172, as we modified the detailed sampling procedure based on your recommendations.

‘’The total number of healthcare providers working at an obstetric unit in selected public health facilities, which was obtained from the zonal health bureau, was 708. From similar data obtained from zonal health office those obstetric care providers that serving selected public health facilities were categorized as 455 Midwifery professional, 108 Nursing, 13 IESO, 39 General practitioner, 89 Health officer and 2 Obstetrician. Before the selection of study participants, proportionate allocations to each health facility were made. Finally, from the list, the required sample sizes of 423 obstetric care providers were selected by simple random sampling techniques’’. For further check the document.

Issue ‘dependent variable’ it fails to differentiate the use either ‘validated’ or ‘structured questionnaire’, this was witnessed by reference number 23

Response:

We have written explicitly about the tool, in particular the dependent variable, validity, and translation of questionnaires. Could you please revise line number 203-216 once? As you pointed out in reference number 23, we only provide the operational definition of the dependent variable; however, we make clear that about the tool in the Data Collection Tool and Procedure section.

What was the type of the analysis since it is composite variable?

Response:

Based on the operational definitions of each variable we dichotomized those variables and proceed binary logistic regression. For instance for dependent variable. After adding each item score that used to assess depression. The total score of nine items ranging from 0 to 27. We dichotomized as score ≥ 10 were considered to have depression symptoms, and a code ‘1’ was given. While those who scored < 9 were considered to have no depression symptoms and a code‘0’. Other was also in similar fashion… then we run binary logistic regression and multivariable regression accordingly…….some modification was made please refer the revised document.

6. The results and the discussion are relatively better. But both should be presented concisely and completely in logical way. The discussion and the explanations are sometimes against evidence. E.g., HEWs demoralized.

Response:

Thank you very much for such constructive suggestion we made revision accordingly.

7. Individual roles of the authors should be explained independently and in detail

Response:

We corrected according to the guide line of PLOS one

‘’ SSA, MH, ZA, GMT, YAW, WG, MAH, ADG, ShMT and LFW have contributed equally to the proposal development, development of the tool, data collection process, and analysis. All the authors have revised the final version of the manuscript and given their approval for publication.’’

8. Poor referencing E.g., Reference number 5.

Response:

Frankly speaking we use some of references direct from web site of different organization that is why some references have lack of full information. However, as much as possible after revision we made a correction accordingly. For instance based on your suggestion reference number 5; we add its URL; Mind Vw. Mood Swings: Causes, Risk Factors, and Ways to Cope. Dotdash Media. 2023. (https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-mood-swings-1067178)

Concerns about this paper were addressed as follow:

1. Title

A. Why you didn’t include private health facilities (I need justification)

Response:

� Due to the fact that most private health facilities do not offer all obstetric and gynecological procedures, we only included governmental facilities. For example, labor and delivery service. Another reason is that the majority of healthcare providers who work in public healthcare facilities are also doing so in the private sector. Finally, the researcher's area of interest is depression among obstetric care providers who work in government health facilities, which have different challenges than private health institutions in terms of work load, income, and other factors.

B. Why you include all obstetric care providers (it is too many) and I need justification.

Response:

� We encompass all obstetric care providers because we have to deal with the working environment in which they carry a comparatively similar burden. Furthermore, depression affects everyone equally and is not selective.

2. Current substance use Do you think that this response is correct? Do you think that health care provider respond to this question in our setting???And if so what types of substance they have been used? Try to make it specify, because there are different types of substance

Response:

� We appreciate you raising these questions. Though social desirability bias plays a part in the issue, all relevant information had been given prior to data collection, so we hope that they were fully provided with information in accordance.

� Actually, during the process of collecting data our questionnaires, addressed commonly used substance such as alcohol, cigarettes, and Kchat.

3. Having burnout symptoms (how did you measure it???)

Please refer line number 193-197

A burnout symptom was measured by previously validated tool in Ethiopia.

Response:

‘’Burnout: There are 19 items to assess symptoms of burnout syndrome (19 items) that are categorized into four Likert scales 0 (never), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often), and 3 (always). The sums of the scores of the rating of the items were calculated with a total minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of Healthcare. Obstetrics care providers that scored more than 23 out of 57 were considered to have burnout symptoms (4).’’

4. Methology

A. It is better if you mention the name of hospital

Your study population is too many (midwives, gynecologist, nurse, integrated emergency surgical officers, HO) so why you include all of them??? It is better if you add the number of proportionally allocated individuals from each hospital

Response:

� Based on your recommendations we try to narrate accordingly on revised document. For schematic presentation due to many (37) health facilities it’s difficult to put it in one diagram. So to handle this issue we try to explain in narrative form and just it’s self-explanatory; please refer sampling technique procedure. If must we will put it…

B. Obstetrics care providers who have worked for at least six months were included? What is your justification?

Response:

� We exclude those health providers due to finally we conclude this study for that study setting. Secondly, those health care providers were not fully engaged in working environments.

5. Study variable Occupation? Is not necessary. They are health care provider

Response:

Thanks for your correction we accept it and already removed.

6. Data collection tools

You used English version of quastionaries.so Do you think that all of your study participants equally understand English language, particularly in our setup???

Response:

� Thanks for your suggestion but we clearly stated in manuscript as following: please check line number 212-214

‘’The questionnaire was prepared in English and later translated into Afan Oromo to check the consistence of questionnaire, and English language was used for data collection’’

7. Data quality control

Your data quality control is not detail explained?

Response:

We can add some important points. Refer from revised document

8. Recommendation

Your recommendation need revision

Response:

� Thank you very much for your suggestion. Since our study is a single study, it is not advisable to recommend policy makers; instead, it should be in line with our findings. We therefore made a correction after reevaluating our findings.

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #3: Try to abide the comments given before. conclusion and recommendation section should be revised.

Some grammatical errors should be corrected

Reviewer #4: The questions raised by the previous reviewer has been answered accordingly. I double checked the referenced lines and they look good. I have noted the following:

1. There is not clear justification for the choice of the variable tested for religion and ethnicity. How do they contribute to the depression? Authors should explain to the reader how/why these variables are important. This should be clearly outlined. For example the salary can have an impact on depression duel to the global economic challenges we are witnessing today.

2. Can the authors explain the impact of the different seen in the frequencies for example in the “Types of health providers”. In that section we only have 2 obstetricians and 311 midwifery. Statistically there will be difference and that this mean that obstetricians are not depressed? The appear to be a problem in the frequencies and this has a chance of obscuring the “true” in the analysis and interpretation.

3. In line 356 in the revised manuscript, the number from Vietnam are missing….this information should be provided and the source cited.

4. In line 360 of the revised manuscript, the authors should cite the studies conducted in this countries.

5. From line 370-375; the authors discuss the effect of working hours and those working over 40 hrs a week appear to be more depressed. What did they observe in the individuals working <40 hrs a week? That need to be articulated in the discussion.

6. Response: “We recommend health professionals take care of themselves from substance use, just to live as exemplary for communities.” Should read: We recommend health professionals take care of themselves and avoid substance use”

7. The data used in this study should be anonymized and made available in the public spaces such as FigShare before the work is published.

Reviewer #5: I thank the authors for addressing the reviewer comments. However, i have just a few minor issues/suggestions i want them to address that i believe will be very beneficial to the reader.

Here are the comments:

I suggest the authors include the setting in the title

Example: Prevalence of Depression and Associated Factors among Obstetric Care Providers at public health facilities in the West Arsi Zone, Ethiopia: Cross-sectional study

I request the authors to add a supplementary table with the individual responses (frequencies and percentages) to each of the items in the following: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, burnout 19 items, and The OSSS-3 sum score.

Response to reviewer -4

1. There is not clear justification for the choice of the variable tested for religion and ethnicity. How do they contribute to the depression? Authors should explain to the reader how/why these variables are important. This should be clearly outlined. For example the salary can have an impact on depression duel to the global economic challenges we are witnessing today.

Response:

� We sincerely appreciate your kind inquiry. You provide a clear explanation of the factors of ethnicity and religion. We also recognize that it can be challenging to link those factors to various illnesses, complications, and other health issues. We only included the descriptive portion and did not perform any association analysis with depression for those variables. We included those variables in the descriptive table solely to describe the sociodemographic characteristics of the population under study.

2. Can the authors explain the impact of the different seen in the frequencies for example in the “Types of health providers”. In that section we only have 2 obstetricians and 311 midwifery. Statistically there will be difference and that this mean that obstetricians are not depressed? The appear to be a problem in the frequencies and this has a chance of obscuring the “true” in the analysis and interpretation.

Response:

� Thank you very much for your question. From the beginning, our study was among obstetric care providers, meaning all types of health care providers who serve in obstetrics and gynecology wards. Initially, we obtain the numbers and types of health care providers that serve Obs/Gyn in selected institutions from the zonal health office. 2 obstetricians and 311 midwives were selected as health professionals during the selection process by simple random sampling techniques from all obstetric care providers found in selected institutions.

3. In line 356 in the revised manuscript, the number from Vietnam are missing….this information should be provided and the source cited.

Response:

� Thank you very much. We take note of the feedback and have included it into the updated document.

4. In line 360 of the revised manuscript, the authors should cite the studies conducted in this countries.

Response:

� Thank you very much. We take note of the feedback and have included it into the updated document.

5. From line 370-375; the authors discuss the effect of working hours and those working over 40 hrs a week appear to be more depressed. What did they observe in the individuals working <40 hrs a week? That need to be articulated in the discussion.

� Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. We accepted and incorporated it in the revised document.

‘’In addition, working extra limits an individual's free time for relaxation, leading to exhaustion and poor sleep, a combination that might lead to depression. On the other hand, having enough time is crucial for better relaxation, which boosts mood, reduces stress, and improves memory and focus. These benefits enable him or her to return to work with a renewed mindset.’’

6. Response: “We recommend health professionals take care of themselves from substance use, just to live as exemplary for communities.” Should read: We recommend health professionals take care of themselves and avoid substance use”

Response:

� Thank you very much for your suggestions. We accepted and incorporated it in the revised document.

7. The data used in this study should be anonymized and made available in the public spaces such as FigShare before the work is published.

Response: Thank very much for your suggestions.
