==== Body
pmcThe journal retracts the article, “A Novel Herbal Hydrogel Formulation of Moringa oleifera for Wound Healing” [1], cited above.

Following publication, concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding overlapping figure panels within this article [1].

Adhering to our procedure, an investigation was conducted by the Editorial Office and Editorial Board that confirmed the overlap with Figure 2, specifically subfigure “5% Hydrogel—Day 13” and “5% Hydrogel—Day 13”. While the authors cooperated within the investigation, they were unable to satisfactorily explain the overlap nor verify the integrity of the abovementioned image panels. As a result, the Editorial Board has lost confidence in the integrity of the findings and decided to retract this publication [1], as per MDPI’s retraction policy (https://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark30) and in line with the Committee on Publication Ethics retraction guidelines (https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines).

This retraction was approved by the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Plants.

The authors did not agree to this retraction.
