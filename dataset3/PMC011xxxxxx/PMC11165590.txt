To address the scarcity of generally applicable photochemical routes to allenylidenes in solution, phenanthrene-based sources have been investigated. Specifically, the syntheses of 1-vinylidene-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene, 1-(2-phenylvinylidene)-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene, and 1-(2-methylvinylidene)-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene, photochemical precursors to propadienylidene, 3-phenylpropadienylidene, and 3-methylpropadienylidene have been carried out. Photolysis of these new precursors in olefin traps and benzene afforded the expected cyclopropane adducts of the corresponding allenylidenes. Quantum chemical calculations show that the ground state of all three carbenes is a singlet with a singlet–triplet gap of ∼29, 30, and 33 kcal/mol for propadienylidene, 3-phenylpropadienylidene, and 3-methylpropadienylidene, respectively.

pmc1 Introduction

Allenylidenes are carbenes featuring a divalent carbon at the terminus of an allenic linkage. The parent member of this class of carbenes, the simplest cumulenyl carbene propadienylidene (1), belongs to the group of C3H2 isomers which also includes the simplest alkynyl carbene, propynylidene (2), that is better described as a triplet diradical; the smallest aromatic carbene, cyclopropenylidene (3); and the simplest carbocyclic alkyne, cyclopropyne (4) (Figure 1).1 In addition to being highly reactive species that challenge our understanding of structure and bonding, C3H2 isomers are of interest due to their apparent ubiquity throughout the galaxy, with 3 and its lowest energy isomer 1 residing in interstellar clouds (especially TMC-1) and planetary atmospheres.2−8 Isomers of C3H2 have also been identified in combustion flames, where they are implicated in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soot.9−11

Figure 1 Isomers of the formula C3H2.

Various experimental routes to 1 and its isomers have been described in the literature whereby light induces transitions between the readily interconvertible intermediates on the C3H2 potential energy surface (Scheme 1). The first reported generation and observation of 1 was by IR spectroscopy in a cryogenic argon matrix, where the perester 5 was used as a progenitor of 3, which rearranged first into 2 and then into 1 upon further irradiation.12 A few years later, the first electronic spectrum of the parent allenylidene 1 was reported in a matrix isolation study that used diazo precursor 6 to generate triplet propynylidene 2, which subsequently isomerized to 1 upon further photolysis (Scheme 1).13 Two critical studies using 13C-labeled 6 demonstrated that not only does 2 interconvert into 1 and 3, but 1 also automerizes (as evident by scrambling of 13C labels), presumably via cyclopropyne 4 which was predicted to be a transition state rather than a discrete intermediate.1,14

Scheme 1 Several Means of Generating 1 and Other Interconvertible Species on the C3H2 Potential Energy Surface

The rotational spectrum of 1 was first reported by Vrtilek et al., who produced the intermediate by a direct current discharge in a gaseous mixture of acetylene, CO, and He.7 Chen and co-workers have also reported the photoionization mass spectrum and photoelectron spectrum of 1, generated by pyrolysis of the dibromo alkyne 7, and estimated that its singlet state lies about 40 kcal/mol below the triplet.15 A subsequent photodetachment study revised that gap to 29.7 kcal/mol.16

The first report on the generation and trapping of 1 in solution described the addition of methyllithium to dibromocyclopropene (8) in the presence of tetramethylethylene (TME, 9) or styrene (10), as shown in Scheme 2.17 The formation of cyclopropanes 11 and 12 was attributed to the interception of initially formed 1 by the alkene traps. It is not clear, however, if the cyclopropanes were formed by “free” 1 or a metal-coordinated carbenoid species serving as a surrogate for 1.

Scheme 2 Generation of 1, or a Carbenoid Equivalent, and its Trapping by Alkenes in Solution

It has been speculated that the pyrolysis of N-propynylaniline (PhNHCH2C≡CH) could produce 1.18 The generation of 1 as a putative intermediate, either during photolysis of the tosylhydrazone salt 13 in methanol or treatment of the N-nitrosourea 14 with NaOMe/MeOH, has also been invoked, based on the formation of ether 15 (Scheme 3).19

Scheme 3 Speculated Generation of 1 from Nitrogenous Precursors and its Trapping by Methanol

Monosubstituted allenylidenes (16) have been generated by the action of alkoxide bases on 1-bromo-1-heptyne 17(20) or propargyl mesylates 18(21) (Scheme 4). Approaches to disubstituted allenylidenes (19) have involved the reaction of allenyl (20 and 21), alkynyl (22, 23, and 24), cyclopropyl (25, 26, and 27), and polychloroalkane derivatives (28 and 29) with strong bases (Scheme 5).22−24 The bases typically used are oxyanions, except in the case of 21 and 26, which required alkyllithium reagents. Under these conditions, it is not always clear if 16 and 19 are produced as free carbenes or metal-coordinated carbenoids.

Scheme 4 Generation of Monosubstituted Allenylidenes from Alkynyl Precursors Under Basic Conditions

Scheme 5 Means of Generating Disubstituted Allenylidenes Under Basic Conditions

Conspicuously absent from the literature is a general and broadly applicable photochemical route for the generation of 1 and other allenylidenes in solution. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one report which describes the generation of a substituted allenylidene, the diphenyl variant 31, by photolysis of the cyclopropane derivative 30 in solvents (Scheme 6).25 When the photolysis is carried out in ethyl vinyl ether, the adduct 32 is formed in 25% yield. Carbene 31 can also be intercepted by cyclohexene albeit in even lower yield.

Scheme 6 Photochemical Generation and Trapping of Diphenylvinylidenecarbene

In an effort to develop alternative photochemical precursors to allenylidenes with a potential for general applicability, we modified our cyclopropanated phenanthrene system (33), from which our laboratory has previously generated several cyclic and acyclic alkylidenecarbenes (34),26 to incorporate an allene unit at the corner of the cyclopropane ring (35a, b, and c), as shown in Scheme 7. Herein, we describe our synthetic approach to 35a, b, and c, their subsequent photolysis leading to the extrusion of 1, 36a, and 36b respectively, and trapping studies. We also present the results of our computational work on the structures and energies of 1, 36a, and 36b using modern methods and basis sets.

2 Results and Discussion

2.1 Synthesis of Phenanthrene-Based Precursors (35a, b, and c) to Carbenes

The syntheses of 1-vinylidene-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (35a), 1-(2-phenylvinylidene)-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (35b), and 1-(prop-1-en-1-ylidene)-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (35c), photochemical precursors to 1, 36a, and 36b, respectively, were accomplished as shown in Scheme 8. First, dibromocarbene was added to phenanthrene under phase-transfer catalysis conditions to afford the dibromocyclopropane 37, using an improved procedure previously developed in our laboratory.27 Reaction of 37 with alkyllithiums at low temperature, followed by addition of the appropriate alkyl halide, gave 38a, b, and c.28 Elimination of HBr from 38a and b using KOtBu in DMSO afforded the alkenes 39a and b, respectively, while KOtBu at 0 °C in THF was used for the conversion of 38c to 39c. Another addition of dibromocarbene to 39a, b, and c(28) gave the corresponding dibromospiropentanes 40a, b, and c. Careful addition of MeLi to 40a, b, and c in ether at 0 °C yielded the desired precursors, 35a, b, and c respectively. The allene 35b was obtained as a mixture of exo and endo isomers in a 1:0.78 ratio, while the same isomers of 35c were obtained in a 0.65:1 mixture. The single-crystal X-ray structures of 35a and exo-35b are shown below in Figure 2, and their salient features are presented in the Supporting Information. The X-ray structures of 38a, 39a, 40a, and 40b are also provided in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Photolysis Experiments

Photolyses of 35a and b were performed in olefin traps TME and 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (DHN). While we observed a product attributable to the adduct of 1 with TME, its low boiling point made isolation and characterization difficult; likewise, while 36a did trap in DHN, it gave two isomers which proved difficult to separate and characterize. Therefore, herein we report in detail only the trapping of 1 in DHN and 36a in TME. Photolysis of 35c was performed only in 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE). In stark contrast to the previous observations with related methylenecyclopropanes,29−31 none of the three precursors showed signs of rearrangement to seven-membered ring systems 41a, b, and c (Scheme 9).

Scheme 9 Rearrangement of 35a, b, and c into the Respective Seven-Membered Systems 41a, b, and c was Not Observed

2.2.1 Photolysis of 35a in DHN and m-Xylene

Photolysis of 35a in DHN, m-xylene (internal standard), and benzene-d6 afforded the allene adduct 42 in 35% yield as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The identity of 42 was confirmed by the independent synthesis of an authentic sample, as shown in Scheme 10. The first step involved the phase-transfer catalyzed addition of dibromocarbene to DHN, giving dibromocyclopropane 43, a known compound.32 Addition of MeLi to 43 and subsequent reaction with iodomethane gave alkyl halide 44. Dehydrobromination of 44 with KOtBu in DMSO gave alkene 45, to which dibromocarbene was added, leading to the spiropentane 46. Finally, the addition of MeLi to ethereal 46 at ice temperature afforded the desired allene 42. GC–MS and NMR analysis of the authentic sample of 42 indicated that it was identical to the product of photolysis, and IR showed the characteristic allene stretch.

2.2.2 Photolysis of 35b in TME

Photolysis of 35b in benzene with a significant excess of TME afforded the allenylcyclopropane adduct 47 (Scheme 11). Product 47 was isolated by column chromatography in 43% yield. The characterization of 47 was performed using the sample isolated from this photolysis, which showed the expected peaks in the 1H and 13C NMR and the characteristic allene stretch in the IR.

Scheme 11 Cyclopropane Adduct 47

2.2.3 Photolysis of 35b in TME and Benzodioxole

Photolysis of 35b in TME, benzodioxole (internal standard), and benzene-d6 gave allene 47 in 33% yield, as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The identity of 47 was confirmed by comparison to the product obtained from the photolysis (Section 2.2.2) above.

2.2.4 Photolysis of 35c in DPE and m-Xylene

Photolysis of 35c in DPE, m-xylene (internal standard), and benzene-d6 afforded the allene 48 in 66% yield, as determined by NMR. The identity of 48 was confirmed by synthesis of an authentic sample, following a known procedure,33 as shown in Scheme 12. First, the propargyl alcohol 49 was converted into the mesylate 50, which was then reacted with KOtBu in the presence of DPE to afford the desired adduct 48. Spectroscopic analysis of 48 showed that it was identical to the product of photolysis.

Scheme 12 Photolysis of 35c in the Presence of DPE Afforded the Cyclopropane Adduct 48, which was Confirmed via Preparation of an Authentic Sample

2.3 Computational Results

We conducted quantum chemical calculations investigating the singlet–triplet gap for both allenylidenes. Single-point DLPNO–CCSD(T)34,35 calculations were performed on geometries optimized using four different methods—double hybrid density functional theory (B2PLYP),36 hybrid density functional theory (both PBE037−39 and B3LYP40,41), and range-separated hybrid density functional theory (ωB97x-D3BJ), using the def2-TZVP basis set in all cases.42 Zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) corrections were applied to all energies.

The computations unanimously determined that 1 is more stable in its singlet ground state by ∼29 kcal/mol, with 36a and b likewise having singlet states ∼30 and ∼33 kcal/mol more stable than their triplets (Table 1). Evidently, the substitutions on 36a and b did little to affect the character of the carbenes, with all species having remarkably similar singlet–triplet gaps. Perhaps this similarity may be attributed to the orthogonal relationship between the two π systems in the allene moiety, which prevents substituents at one terminus from exerting a major influence on the carbene center at the other terminus. An overwhelming favorability for the singlet ground state is noted in the literature on both alkylidene carbenes and allenylidene carbenes,24 so the calculated singlet favorability of the present species is expected. Furthermore, experimental16 and computational43 singlet–triplet gaps for 1 (29.7 and 30 kcal/mol respectively) are in very good agreement with our computations. The singlet–triplet gaps for 36a and 36b have not been previously reported to our knowledge.

Singlet and triplet geometries of all intermediates are similar, with the major difference being in the length of the allenic bonds. Specifically, the β,γ-double bond in the singlet allenylidenes measured 1.28 Å, while the α,β-double bond was slightly longer at 1.33 Å. The same bonds in the triplet allenylidenes differed slightly, at 1.23 and 1.38 Å. The angles at the central carbon in the allene moiety were all nearly 180°, apart from triplets 36a and b, which had an angle of ∼178° and thus adopted a slight bend.

3 Conclusions

Herein, we report what is, to our knowledge, the first photochemical generation of the parent allenylidene (1) in solution. The possibility of this approach to other substituted allenylidenes is supported by the generation of the phenyl and methyl analogues (36a and b). A straightforward synthetic sequence provided access to the photochemical precursors 1-vinylidene-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (35a), 1-(2-phenylvinylidene)-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (35b), and 1-(prop-1-en-1-ylidene)-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (35c). Photolysis of 35a, b, and c in olefin traps with benzene as the solvent afforded the expected cyclopropane adducts. Quantum chemical calculations with geometries optimized by four different methods unanimously placed singlets 1, 36a, and 36b ∼29, ∼30, and ∼33 kcal/mol lower in energy than their triplets, respectively. Given the success in generating these two allenylidenes photochemically in solution, we plan to use precursors 35a, b, and c in time-resolved laser flash photolysis experiments in the future, which would be the first time that allenylidenes have been studied directly in this fashion.

4 Experimental Methods

4.1 General Experimental Procedures

Tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether were degassed by purging with nitrogen and dried by passage through two activated alumina columns (2 ft × 4 in). Other solvents and reagents were used as obtained from commercial sources. Caution should be exercised while working with alkyllithium reagents. Previously, we have reported procedures for preparing 1,1-dibromo-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (37)27 and 1-benzylidene-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (39b).28 Medium pressure flash chromatography was performed on an automated system using prepacked silica gel columns (70–230 mesh) with the indicated eluents. Proton (1H) and proton-decoupled carbon (13C {1H}) NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or C6D6 at 500 and 126 MHz, respectively. The chemical shifts are reported in δ ppm with tetramethylsilane set to 0 ppm. Infrared spectra (resolution 0.4 cm–1) were acquired on samples with an FTIR instrument equipped with an attenuated total reflectance accessory and were processed with SpectraGryph.44 GC/MS data were obtained with a capillary gas chromatograph interfaced with a quadrupole, triple-axis mass selective detector operating in the electron impact mode. High resolution mass spectra were obtained on a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTRMS). High resolution mass spectra were acquired either on a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS, Ionicon Analytik, Innsbruck, Austria) or an LC-TOF-MS system. Melting points are uncorrected. Single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography were either obtained by slow evaporation of the hexanes from column fractions or from vapor diffusion using a binary solvent system (DCM/pentanes).

Photolyses were performed at ambient temperature in benzene in a long-necked quartz cuvette or in benzene-d6 in a quartz NMR tube and were monitored using GC–MS and NMR. A medium pressure 200 W Hg–Xe arc lamp (Newport Model #6291), equipped with a 280–400 nm dichroic, was used for photolysis with the sample placed approximately 30 cm from the light source. Alternatively, a Rayonet reactor equipped with eight 8 W 254 nm lamps and eight 8 W 300 nm lamps were used for photolyses. Caution should be exercised while working with high powered ultraviolet radiation.

Computational software used in calculations as well as X-ray crystallography equipment and procedures have been recently described.31

4.1.1 Exo-1-bromo-1-methyl-1a,9b-dihydrocyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (38a)

The dibromo derivative 37 (10.66 g, 30.5 mmol) was dissolved in 250 mL of THF in a 500 mL three-necked flask under argon and stirred with a magnetic stir bar. The solution was cooled to −70 °C in a bath of acetone and dry ice. Once cooled, methyllithium (22.5 mL, 1.6 M in diethyl ether, 36 mmol) was slowly added over 60 minutes. After 30 minutes of stirring at this temperature, methyl iodide (5 mL, 80 mmol) was added in excess. The solution was allowed to stir at −70 °C for another hour, after which it was removed from the ice bath and allowed to stir overnight. The reaction was then quenched with H2O (60 mL), and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with H2O (2 × 50 mL) and brine (3 × 50 mL). 38a was isolated as a white solid using flash-column chromatography with hexanes as eluent. The yield was 6.51 g (76%); mp: 109–112 °C. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.95 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.47 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.30 (m, 4H), 3.19 (s, 2H), 1.23 (s, 3H). 13C{1H} NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3): δ 131.0, 130.8, 130.1, 128.1, 127.3, 122.9, 34.7, 33.9, 19.1.

The solution was stirred for 1 day, after which it was quenched with H2O (100 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with diethyl ether (4 × 50 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with H2O (2 × 100 mL) and brine (2 × 50 mL). 39a was isolated as a white solid using flash-column chromatography with hexanes as eluent. The yield was 1.77 g (81%); mp: 122–124 °C. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.97 (d, J = 5.0 Hz, 2H), 7.39 (d, J = 4.1 Hz, 2H), 7.26 (dd, J = 8.5, 4.3 Hz, 4H), 5.36 (s, 2H), 3.16 (s, 2H). 13C{1H} NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3): δ 134.3, 132.8, 129.0, 128.9, 127.9, 126.3, 123.3, 102.6, 22.3.

The alkene 39a (0.98 g, 4.79 mmol), benzyltriethylammonium chloride (0.074 g, 0.325 mmol), CHBr3 (1.1 mL, 3.2 g, 13.4 mmol), and CH2Cl2 (12 mL) were added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask and stirred with a magnetic stir bar at room temperature. Then, 50% aq NaOH (20 mL) was added over 10 minutes to the reaction mixture. The flask was loosely capped, and the mixture was allowed to stir for 3 days. The mixture was quenched with H2O (15 mL), the aqueous layer extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 20 mL), and the combined organic layers washed with H2O (2 × 20 mL) and brine (3 × 20 mL). 40a was isolated as a white solid using flash-column chromatography with hexanes as eluent. The yield was 1.08 g (61%); mp: 186–187 °C. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.03 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 2H), 7.40–7.30 (m, 4H), 7.29 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 2H), 3.29 (s, 2H), 1.32 (s, 2H). 13C{1H} NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3): δ 132.1, 130.0, 129.3, 127.9, 127.1, 123.4, 35.2, 30.2, 29.1, 25.8. FTIR: ν 3068, 3011, 1485, 1439 cm–1.

4.1.4 1-Vinylidene-1a,9b-dihydro-1H-cyclopropa[l]phenanthrene (35a)

40a (186 mg, 0.499 mmol) was dissolved in diethyl ether (60 mL) in a 100 mL three-necked flask and stirred with a magnetic stir bar under argon. The vessel was cooled to and maintained at 0 °C, and methyllithium (0.500 mL, 1.6 M in diethyl ether, 0.800 mmol) was very slowly added over 20 minutes. The mixture was allowed to stir for 30 more minutes, and then quenched with ice water (50 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 25 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine (2 × 25 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate. 35a was isolated as a white solid using flash-column chromatography with hexanes as eluent. The yield was 59 mg (55%); mp: decomposes at 127 °C. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.01 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.45 (d, J = 6.3 Hz, 2H), 7.30 (dt, J = 11.6, 6.1 Hz, 4H), 4.93–4.77 (m, 1H), 4.75–4.62 (m, 1H), 3.59 (s, 2H). 13C{1H} NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3): δ 190.5, 132.5, 129.5, 129.3, 128.1, 126.9, 123.4, 79.2, 78.5, 26.9.

4.1.5 1,1-Dibromo-1a,2,3,7b-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopropa[a]naphthalene (43)

The final yield was 236 mg (8% yield over 2 steps). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.35–7.26 (m, 8H), 7.23–7.19 (m, 2H), 5.43 (qt, J = 7.2, 3.9 Hz, 1H), 2.25 (dd, J = 7.0, 3.9 Hz, 1H), 2.19 (dd, J = 7.1, 4.1 Hz, 1H), 1.82 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, 3H). 13C{1H} NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3): δ 190.3, 143.5, 143.1, 128.3, 128.3, 128.3, 128.1, 126.5, 126.5, 90.4, 86.7, 36.8, 24.4, 15.2. FTIR: ν 3057, 3026, 2911, 2014, 1601, 1493, 1445, 1402 cm–1. HRMS (ESI) m/z: [M + H]+ calcd for C18H17, 233.1325; found, 233.1345.

4.1.18 Photolysis of 35a in 1,2-Dihydronapthalene and m-Xylene

Precursor 35a (2.2 mg, 0.010 mmol) was dissolved in 0.75 mL benzene-d6 in a quartz NMR tube. 1,2-Dihydronapthalene (11.3 μL, 11.3 mg, 0.087 mmol) was added, followed by m-xylene (2 μL, 1.72 mg, 0.016 mmol) as an internal standard. The tube was placed in the Rayonet Reactor, and the progress of the photolysis was monitored every 30 minutes until all 35a had photolyzed, or 4.5 hours. Yields of 42 (0.59 mg, 0.0035 mmol, 35%) and phenanthrene (1.5 mg, 0.0085 mmol, 85%) were thus determined. The photolysate was subsequently analyzed via GC–MS and compared to an authentic sample to verify identity.

4.1.19 Photolysis of 35b in TME

Precursor 35b (45 mg, 0.154 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL benzene and 1 mL TME in a long-necked quartz cuvette. The photolysis was performed using the HgXe arc lamp for 20 hours, and the photolysate after this time was assessed via GC–MS and MS to ensure that all 35b had photolyzed. To isolate the trapped carbene 47, the mixture was purified by flash column on silica using hexanes, giving 47 as clear oil. The yield was 13 mg (43%).

4.1.20 Photolysis of 35b in TME and Benzodioxole

Precursor 35b (6.1 mg, 0.021 mmol) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of C6D6 in a quartz NMR tube, and 5.0 μL of 1,3-benzodioxole (5.3 mg, 0.043 mmol) was added to the tube as an internal standard. 8.2 μL of TME (5.8 mg, 0.069 mmol) was also added as the trapping agent. Photolysis with the HgXe arc lamp was monitored by NMR until all 35b had reacted, or for 5 hours. Yields of 47 (1.4 mg, 0.0069 mmol, 33%) and phenanthrene (2.6 mg, 0.017 mmol, 81%) were thus determined.

4.1.21 Photolysis of 35c in 1,1-Diphenylethylene and m-Xylene

Precursor 35c (3.2 mg, 0.014 mmol) was dissolved in 0.75 mL of C6D6 in a quartz NMR tube, 2.5 μL of m-xylene (2.2 mg, 0.021 mmol) was added as an internal standard, and 16 μL 1,1-diphenylethylene (16 mg, 0.087 mmol) was added as a trapping agent. Photolysis was performed using the HgXe arc lamp and was monitored every 30 minutes until all 35c had reacted, or for 1 hour. A yield of 48 (2.1 mg, 0.0092 mmol, 66%) was thus determined.
