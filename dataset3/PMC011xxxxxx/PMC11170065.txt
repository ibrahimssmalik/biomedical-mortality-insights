Background: The roll out of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are underway in the UK, and ensuring good uptake in vulnerable communities will be critical to reducing hospital admissions and deaths. There is emerging evidence that vaccine hesitancy is higher in ethnic minorities and deprived areas, and that this may be caused by distrust and misinformation in the community. This study aims to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in an ethnically diverse and deprived population of Bradford through the Born in Bradford (BiB) research programme.

Methods: Surveys were sent to parents in BiB who had taken part in a previous Covid-19 survey (n=1727). Cross tabulations explored variation by ethnicity and deprivation. Answers to a question asking the main reason for hesitancy was analysed using thematic analysis.

Results: 535 (31%) of those invited between 29 th October-9 th December 2020 participated. 48% were White British, 37% Pakistani heritage and 15% from other ethnicities; 46% were from the most deprived quintile of the Index of Multiple Deprivation. 29% of respondents do want a vaccine, 10% do not. The majority had not thought about it (29%) or were unsure (30%). Vaccine hesitancy differed by ethnicity and deprivation: 43% (95% CIs: 37-54%) of White British and 60% (35-81%) in the least deprived areas do want a vaccine, compared to 13% (9-19%) of Pakistani heritage and 20% (15-26%) in the most deprived areas. Reasons for not wanting a vaccine were commonly explained by confusion and distrust which was linked to exposure to misinformation.

Conclusions: There is a risk of unequitable roll out of the vaccination programme in the UK with higher vaccine hesitancy in ethnic minorities and those living in deprived areas. There is an urgent need to tackle misinformation that is leading to uncertainty and confusion about the vaccines.

Based on the reviewers comments we have added more information throughout to provide more clarity about the sample, methods, participants and results, as well as adding in an additional table to show differences in trust of organisations by ethnicity. The discussion has been amended to: a) highlight our unique findings (that we have responses from a very diverse community, and this is in stark contrast to other studies completed up to that point that sometimes claimed to have found ethnic differences with a sample of <10% ethnic minorities); and b) to link our findings more explicitly to the context of the time within the UK.

pmcIntroduction

The roll out of the first approved coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine began on 8 th December 2020 in the UK. Ensuring good uptake will be critical to reducing hospital admissions and deaths. However, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been what the World Health Organisation has called an ‘infodemic’: an overwhelming amount of information about COVID-19, much of it unchecked and uncontrolled and spread through social media channels 1 . The relationship between mis-information, distrust and vaccine up-take is multi-factorial and complex 2 , however, recent qualitative research undertaken during the COVID-19 Pandemic suggested that the overwhelming and contradictory information available about COVID-19 has caused confusion, distrust and distress 3 . Importantly, this study found that the greater these feelings of confusion and distress, the less positive people were about COVID-19 vaccination.

A number of research studies in the UK have indicated that 45-64% of the population are likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines if offered, and that a small proportion (4-9%) say they definitely would not accept a vaccine 3– 8 . There are indications in these studies that a lack of trust of key organisations and exposure to misinformation increases vaccine hesitancy 3, 5, 7, 8 . There are also signs that vaccine hesitancy is higher in ethnic minority and deprived communities 6– 8 ; however this evidence comes from studies with a very small proportion of ethnic minority participants (6-9%). Given that ethnic minority and deprived communities have been disproportionately affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2; SARS-CoV-2) 9 , it is critical that vaccine hesitancy and concerns in these communities are well understood so that vaccine up-take can be enhanced.

The Born in Bradford (BiB) research programme has harnessed existing strong relationships with participants in their ongoing birth cohorts to help understand the impact of COVID-19 on ethnically diverse families, many of whom live in deprived communities. This programme of research uses a mixed methods longitudinal adaptive approach to provide actionable intelligence to local decision makers about how best to minimise health inequalities and aid the City’s recovery 10 . As part of this programme, longitudinal surveys have been completed with data collection in the first COVID-19 lockdown (April–May 2020) 11 , and a follow-up survey in October to December 2020. The latter survey included questions about levels of trust in relation to key organisations and vaccination hesitancy.

This paper reports findings from the second survey of BiB parents, exploring vaccine hesitancy and trust of organisations, by ethnicity and deprivation and aims to provide insights into the reasons why people are uncertain or unwilling to accept the COVID-19 vaccines.

Methods

Study design

Quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey questions from the BiB Covid-19 survey (October–December 2020), collected as part of a larger longitudinal Covid-19 research programme 10 .

Setting

Located in the North of England, Bradford is the 6th largest city in the UK. The city has a multi-ethnic population of more than 500,000 people, and suffers from high levels of deprivation and some of the worst health and education outcomes in England. Born in Bradford 12 ( www.borninbradford.nhs.uk) is an internationally-recognised applied health research programme which aims to find out what keeps families healthy and happy. BiB includes a vast ‘city of research’ infrastructure which includes detailed health and wellbeing information on more than 30,000 Bradfordians enrolled in three birth cohort studies 3 . Participants for this study came from the

Study population

Our sample was taken from parents in the BiB Growing Up study who had taken part in recent pre-Covid-19 follow-up ((n=5,154, 2017–2020) and who had completed the first Covid-19 survey (n=1,581, April–June 2020). Parents had an index child aged between 9–13 13 .

Mode of delivery and data collection

Surveys were sent out by post or email, dependent on participants’ preferences. Follow-up by phone was completed 1-3 weeks later and a reminder postcard/email was sent 3-4 weeks after the first contact. For participants with little or no English, surveys were completed in their main language via phone wherever possible.

Consent

Participants had previously consented to be a part of Born in Bradford and for their research and routine health and education data to be used for research. For this survey, and as approved by the HRA and Bradford/Leeds research ethics committee, verbal consent was taken for questionnaires completed over the phone and logged in the questionnaire database. Implied consent was assumed for all questionnaires completed via post or online.

Measures

Key questionnaire domains for the survey were co-produced with the Bradford Institute for Health Research COVID-19 Scientific Advisory Group 14 , and key policy and decision makers within Bradford and communities. Questions were selected or adapted from other relevant questionnaires. The full survey can be viewed here: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Q0SPIQ

The survey covered key domains on health, wellbeing and economic insecurity as per the first lockdown questionnaire 11 . We also asked about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy 8 , trust of organisations and flu vaccine uptake for this year (winter 2020/21), see Figure 1. Following on from the vaccine hesitancy question, a free text question asked participants “what is your main reason for this [answer]” in order to illuminate the closed question responses.

Figure 1. Survey questions on vaccine hesitancy and trust of organisations.

Ethnicity was captured in self-reported questionnaires administered at baseline recruitment to the cohorts (March 2007 to December 2010) and categorised as ‘White British’, ‘Pakistani Heritage’ and Other (there were small numbers of non-White British, non-Pakistani Heritage parents from multiple ethnic groups). We linked residential address (as at 31st March 2019) to the 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and composed quintiles of deprivation from least to most deprived 15 .

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics are presented for each of the survey domains. We used cross tabulations (proportions and 95% confidence intervals) to explore differences in trust and vaccine hesitancy by ethnicity and deprivation. We also explored vaccine hesitancy by trust of different key organisations, and by uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine. All statistical analyses were carried out using Stata 15 16 .

Qualitative analysis

The free text responses to the question asking for the reason for the participants response to the vaccine hesitancy question were explored using thematic analysis 17 , in order to illuminate the vaccine hesitancy closed question responses. The first 255 responses were analysed by RM and CE, employing an inductive approach where coding and theme development were driven by the content of the responses. A codebook was then developed (by RM, CE and BL) that grouped the responses based on how participants had answered the vaccine hesitancy question to look at key themes for individuals who: a) felt positive about the vaccines; b) were undecided/ had not considered the vaccines; or c) felt negative towards the vaccines. Multiple codes were used within each category to explore and effectively summarise their responses.

The remaining responses were coded by RM and CE alongside frequent discussion with BL to test the strength and validity of the codebook. During this process, thorough and frequent discussion between the researchers took place, allowing adjustments to be made to the original codebook to ensure it was reflective of all responses.

Ethics

This research was approved by the HRA and Bradford/Leeds research ethics committee (BiB Growing Up study 16/YH/0320).

Results

Out of a total of 1581 eligible participants, 535 (34%) participated in the study between 29 th October and 9 th December 2020.

The mean age of respondents was 42 years (SD 6), with 500 women and 35 men; 234 (48%) were White British, 178 (37%) Pakistani heritage and 74 (15%) from other ethnic groups; 243 (46%) were from the most deprived quintile of IMD. Participants were broadly representative of those who completed the first COVID-19 survey and of those in the entire BiB sample 10 , but with a drop of ~5% in participation from Pakistani heritage participants and people in the most deprived quintile of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), see Table 1. There was variation in levels of IMD based on ethnicity, with a higher proportion of Pakistani heritage (70%) and other ethnic groups (58%) living in the lowest quintile of IMD than White Britsh participants (25%) see Table 2.

Trust of organisations

Table 3 shows that the most trusted organisations were the NHS (N=432, 89% (95% CIs ), the local hospital (N=415, 85%), and schools (N= 405, 84%). The least trusted were the Government (N= 136, 49%), the local council (N=335, 69%) and faith organisations (N= 326, 67%). There were patterns suggesting differences in trust of organisations by ethnicity, with White British respondents being more likely to trust the NHS and schools, and to be more likely to dis-trust the Government and local council. Pakistani heritage respondents were more likely to trust religious settings. Across all organisations the ‘Other’ ethnic group were more likely to respond ‘don’t know’. However, the variance in responses was low, with small numbers reporting distrust across organisations, making these findings hard to interpret with any certainty (see Table 4). When asked how confident they were that the Government was doing the right thing to stop the spread of COVID-19, 189 (39%) respondents were somewhat or extremely unconfident and 140 (29%) were confident in the Government’s approach, there didn’t appear to be any ethnic differences in responses to this question.

IMD = Index of Multiple Deprivation

Figure 2 shows that there were significant differences in vaccine hesitancy by ethnicity: 43% (95% CIs: 37-54%) of White British respondents said that they do want a vaccine compared to only 13% (9-19%) of Pakistani heritage respondents. Pakistani heritage respondents were more likely to be uncertain (36%, 30-44%), or to have not thought about it (41%, 34-49%), rather than stating they would not have a vaccine (10%, 6-15%).

Figure 3 demonstrates significant differences based on levels of deprivation. Of the least deprived quintile of IMD, 60% (35-81%) said that they do want a vaccine, compared to 20% (15-26%) in the most deprived quintile.

Figure 4 (see also Table 2) shows that participants who trusted the NHS a great deal were most likely to have decided they want a vaccine (44%, 38-51%), and those that distrusted the NHS were most likely to not want a vaccine (30%, 15-50%).

Reasons for vaccine Hesitancy response

Of the 535 returned surveys, 64% (n = 343) offered a reason for their response to the question about accepting a vaccine. The main reasons are summarized below based on the response to the vaccine hesitancy questions:

a) Do not want a vaccine

Those that had decided they do not want a vaccine often stated that there had not been enough research/evidence, it had been ‘rushed through’ and they were concerned about the safety of the vaccines. Their responses were generally stronger and more suspicious in tone than respondents in the other groups, implying and sometimes stating a lack of trust of those that had developed and approved the vaccines:

I don’t trust the vaccine, it’s been rushed through, side effects etc. just haven't been explored enough

Untrustworthy of ingredients

Do not trust that the vaccine safety testing will have been rigorous enough, due to being very rushed.

I don't trust them

The lack of trust in the vaccines expressed by some participants’ appeared to be connected to their exposure to misinformation about the COVID-19 virus and vaccines, and these views were very strong in some responses:

I'm very suspicious of the reasons for the world’s reaction to COVID-19 and not sure I can trust what is in the vaccination.

Apparently a fix for Covid , but at what cost in the future. Most people who get Covid will survive it without a vaccine. Vaccinating everyone is a great risk, as no-one had heard of Corona at the beginning of this year. Millions of people walk round with cancer cells, it's interesting none of these companies have ever looked for a vaccine for those!!

A small number of respondents felt that they did not need a vaccine; either because they were fit and healthy or were taking other precautions, so not at risk:

I'm healthy and symptom free. Plus I don't feel comfortable having an unknown vaccine

Because I'm not in an at risk or vulnerable category.

They're not vegan and I don't agree with vaccines. A healthy diet is the best defense.

Family is in good health so we don’t need it

b) Unsure about having a vaccine

Those who were unsure about having a vaccine expressed concerns about not having enough information to be able to make an informed decision, they were also anxious about not knowing the side effects, the speed with which vaccines had been developed and the safety of the vaccines.:

Too much of speculations going around that the vaccine is not good so want to know more. Have more info, then will decide.

I would like to see the side effects, if any, before committing. I am not an anti-vaccinator, however because it’s new and potentially rushed, would be cautious

I'm really anxious about the vaccination because of the speed in which it is being developed. I worry about possible side effects.

Similar to those who said they did not want the vaccine, these respondents also indicated that exposure to recent and prevalent misinformation had confused them. However these responses tended to be less suspicious than those of participants who did not want a vaccine:

[Lack of] confidence in fast track development. I know it is unlikely but thalidomide springs to mind for people who took a new drug. That said I do get the flu vac each year and my children are inoculated so I guess I am confused so far.

Just unsure about COVID-19 in general due to people saying it’s not real etc. I'm confused.

c) Not yet thought about having a vaccine

For those respondents who indicated that they had not yet thought about having a vaccine, it is worth noting that the majority of the responses were returned before a vaccine was available to be administered which influenced some of the responses:

Until a vaccine has been made why ask!

Don’t expect vaccines to be ready until mid-2021

There’s no imminent vaccine for COVID-19 , nothing to think about yet

It was also apparent from some responses that people were not aware that a number of COVID-19 vaccines were very close to being approved:

Nothing conclusive has been created.

Will be years before vaccine is found

Similar to the respondents who were uncertain about the vaccine, many responders who said they hadn’t thought about it yet indicated that they were worried about efficacy, safety and potential side effects of the vaccine.

The other key theme that emerged in this group was the need to focus on the present moment and that they did not have the time/space to think about a vaccine right now:

I am focused on getting through the here and now rather than spending time about what might happen in the future

Not thinking about Covid anymore fed up of it on TV news everywhere

Discussion

This study describes the levels of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy, and levels of trust of key organisations, in a highly ethnically diverse group of families living in the deprived city of Bradford at the end of 2019. The level of acceptance of vaccination was much lower than found in other studies, with just 29% of respondents being sure they would accept a vaccine, compared to 45-64% found in other studies 3– 8 . The rates of acceptance in our study were similar to these other studies for our White British participants (43%) and those living in the highest two quintiles of IMD (53–60%). These findings suggest that by failing to include a meaningful proportion of ethnic minority participants, and of those living in deprived areas, previous studies have produced potentially misleading findings.

Born in Bradford is a ‘people powered’ research study; as with other research completed by BiB, the local community were consulted during the Covid-19 lockdowns to understand their concerns and make sure that our research addressed their needs. The Covid-19 survey and recruitment approach were tested through our established research advisory groups and the findings of the study were also shared with these groups to enhance interpretation and ensure useful dissemination back to the community 10 . We believe that this depth of engagement is what has enabled us to give a voice to seldom heard communities who are particularly vulnerable to the impact of Covid-19 and who have also been more vulnerable to exposure from the ‘infodemic’ of misinformation around Covid-19 and the vaccine.

Our survey also included a free text response asking participants to give the main reason for their vaccine hesitancy response. These responses have helped to illuminate our findings showing that the reasons for not wanting a vaccine included high levels of suspicion or distrust in those that had developed and approved the vaccines, which was often linked to a belief in misinformation about the existence of Covid-19 and the safety and/or the speed with which the vaccine had been developed. Similarly, those who remain uncertain expressed the need for more information, and also some confusion from exposure to misinformation. Those that hadn’t yet thought about vaccination were either focusing on the present moment and didn’t want to think about COVID-19 anymore or were unaware that vaccines were imminent. They also raised similar safety concerns to the undecided group.

These results highlight a much lower level of vaccine acceptability in ethnic minorities, those living in deprived areas and those that distrust the NHS. These findings strengthen the key messages from our recent qualitative work with ethnic minority groups - that there is an urgent need to tackle the overwhelming misinformation about COVID-19 that is leading to uncertainty and confusion about the need for the vaccine, and in the worst cases, a belief that the vaccine should not be accepted 3 .

The results of this survey have been used to inform local policy through the Bradford District Strategic Coordination Group. A communications strategy has targeted different communities with culturally appropriate messages about the vaccine led by trusted role models and faith leaders. This has included high profile vaccine champions aiming to dispel vaccine myths through multiple media channels and developing a grassroots network of COVID-19 leads to provide neighbourhood advice and support.

We suggest that a wider and similarly carefully targeted response is required to increase vaccine acceptability across the UK, particularly in ethnic minority groups and those living in deprived communities. Most importantly, messaging needs to reassure those who are uncertain or unwilling to think about the vaccines. This messaging needs to be culturally appropriate, provided in non-technical language, and be empathetic to the levels of confusion and distress that people are feeling. This is in direct contrast to the predominantly blanket ‘one size fits all’ messaging from the UK government that has, at times, shown a lack of appreciation of the complexity of people’s living circumstances and of their exposure to misinformation 18, 19 .

Currently messages regarding Covid-19 and vaccines have been issued by the typo - Government and by local authorities, both of whom have been shown in our survey to be distrusted. There were much stronger levels of trust of the NHS, local hospitals and schools, and in Pakistani heritage communities, also of religious settings. Use of trusted organisations, and of trusted community and faith leaders where appropriate, may help to reassure and encourage those who are currently not willing to accept the vaccine.

Strengths and limitations

These findings demonstrate varying levels of trust of key organisations and differential views on vaccine hesitancy based on ethnicity and deprivation. Our study is the first to provide views from a population with a high degree of ethnic diversity and deprivation. Our sample, whilst being diverse, showed variation in deprivation by ethnicity, with a much larger proportion of ethnic minority participants living in the lowest decile of deprivation compared to White British participants. This large overlap in ethnicity and deprivation is important to acknowledge, although one in four White British participants did also live in the lowest quintile. The response rate to this study was also low (31%) and the vast majority of responders were female with an average age of 42 years (which is to be expected as the majority of BiB participants are women recruited during their pregnancy). Non-responders, male participants and different age groups may have different views to those reported here.

Nevertheless our findings do reflect those reported in other studies, with the level of vaccine hesitancy in White British parents matching that found in other studies, as well as a decreased likelihood of vaccine acceptability in those from ethnic minorities and/or living in deprived circumstances.

The approach to allow open text responses to illuminate people’s views on vaccination, also adds strength to this study. The reasons for uncertainty or unwillingness reflect those found in a recent report 8 .

This study was completed before any of the vaccines had been approved for roll out so there are likely to be some changes in perception now and further exploration of this would be valuable.

The longitudinal nature of the BiB cohorts will allow us to explore change over time and we will continue to follow families throughout the pandemic, adding further value to this research. In addition we have access to routine health data for all participants which will allow us to look at vaccine up-take as data become available throughout 2021.

Conclusion

Vaccination hesitancy differs based on ethnicity, level of deprivation and trust of key organisations, with those most at risk of serious impact of the virus being the least likely to accept vaccination. Confusion, distrust and distress which was often linked to exposure to misinformation was a main cause of this high vaccine hesitancy. Effective and equitable roll out of the vaccination programme requires careful, empathetic messaging, targeting those whom it will benefit the most, and a multi-organisational approach to address issues of distrust.

The authors discussed an important topic, “vaccine hesitancy,” a chronic public health problem that has led to morbidity, mortality, and decreased life expectancy. While the authors try to discuss the association between misinformation and COVID-19 in ethnically diverse groups, there is a need to add some details to provide readers with more clarity. There are a lot of gaps in providing new information in terms of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

Abstract The study design should be stated in the methods section

The authors indicated n=1727 in the methods section, but 535 was noted in the results section. Please clarify the actual sample size used for analysis.

Introduction: The authors stated this sentence in the first part of the introduction: “Importantly, this study found that the more significant these feelings of confusion and distress, the less positive people were about COVID-19 vaccination,” this may be premature to add to the introduction section. It is suggested that statements like this be moved to the discussion section.

The second section of the introduction should be about vaccine hesitancy: definition, history, and other associated factors. Authors may want to provide more context on this as it relates to the United Kingdom.

The study’s objectives need to be clearly stated in the last section.

Methods: The sample population needs to be differentiated from the actual sample size, and the author's writer should categorically state the sample size for analysis.

The study design for the manuscript being reviewed should be stated.

The authors should clarify how the sentence “parents had an index child aged between 9-13” is relevant to this study.

Results: Although the authors mentioned using a thematic approach to analyze the qualitative data, the themes were not actually itemized in the report. While examples of respondents’ responses were included, there is a need to categorize these responses under a common theme.

General Comments

Thank you for the opportunity to review your research study on this very important topic. I have taken the chance to review your paper critically and offer helpful suggestions with the purpose of making it a more useful, clear, and relevant read.  

Abstract I believe that the abstract needs to be a standalone section of the manuscript that provides all essential details on the research study. Some information is missing that should be included in the abstract for clarity: What was the population? Where were they from? How were they selected? This does not need to be long, but the information I see in the abstract is “ethnically diverse and deprived population,” which seems wholly inadequate, and possibly minimizing the uniqueness of the population you chose to target. It also seems that your definition of deprivation and ethnically diverse are intimately tied; White British (ethnicity 1) are “least deprived” while Pakistani (ethnicity 2) are “most deprived.” I think there is a strong need to clarify this in the abstract to avoid any conflation between characteristics.

In the same vein, I would also suggest clarifying the first part of the first sentence in the results: 535 of 1727 of X.

Introduction While you are correct that there is a relationship between greater confusion/distress, and lower views of vaccination, the relationship isn’t as simple as you are portraying. I think it might be okay to keep this as-is, but you must acknowledge that the relationship is complex, and in some cases, the reverse relationship has been found, emphasizing the need to investigate the relationship fully. I discuss this in a recently published paper, but there are hundreds of papers that emphasize complexity of this relationship: Majid, U., Wasim, A., Bakshi, S., & Truong, J. (2020). Knowledge,(mis-) conceptions, risk perception, and behavior change during pandemics: A scoping review of 149 studies.  Public Understanding of Science,  29(8), 777-799. 1

Methods In your introduction, you mention that you used a mixed-methods longitudinal design, but in the methods section, you mention that your study design was a survey. Perhaps this paper describes the survey portion that is one of many components of your broader design? In any case, the “study design” section should be used to clarify the relationship between this paper, other papers, and your broader research program.

Given that some readers may not know about the Born in Bradford Growing Up family cohort, I think it might be beneficial to discuss its characteristics in this paper. I recognize that you probably have another paper that goes into depth about those characteristics but having a brief summary here is essential to make this paper standalone. I also feel that as someone who is not from the UK or the community, I want to know more about Bradford, to help me to understand the surrounding context of the findings. This might include the total population of Bradford, and how the 1727 was determined.

Since I see that you analyzed “open responses” using thematic analysis, you should describe the content of those open responses in the measures section in a brief sentence, and why this part was included in the survey.

The qualitative analysis is missing the approach or process you used to compare between different “types” of responses. So, you analyzed positive, negative, and undecided responses separately. How did you compare them?

This also seems like an analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. In this case, it is a mixed-methods survey, and there is an opportunity to explain how you have integrated quantitative and qualitative data from the survey. Fetters, M. D., Curry, L. A., & Creswell, J. W. (2013). Achieving integration in mixed methods designs—principles and practices.  Health services research,  48(6pt2), 2134-2156. 2

Clark, V. L. P. (2019). Meaningful integration within mixed methods studies: Identifying why, what, when, and how.  Contemporary Educational Psychology,  57, 106-111. 3

Results Demographics: I certainly appreciate the description of participants at the beginning of the results section. I am wondering if you can offer a bit more clarity on how (if at all) ethnicity and deprivation overlap. The current table does not explore this overlap at all, but if there is an overlap in your population, then it needs to be recognized in your analysis. In other words, are White British mostly in “least deprived” areas and Pakistani and other ethnicities in “most deprived” areas?

Quantitative Findings Can you perhaps elaborate on trust in organizations part across ethnicity, socioeconomic status/deprivation? This is similar to how you have done for the following sections.

Qualitative Findings: The fifth quote talks about mistrust and distrust, but it follows your sentence on misinformation. I am not sure that you allow for a strong connection between misinformation and mistrust/distrust. The presentation of qualitative research findings requires that you have a good presentation of findings where each quote and your interpretations are intimately linked.

Each quote might also benefit if you identified the ethnicity of each person and if they were from a more or less deprived area.

You discuss misinformation in two places. I would suggest that you integrate into one area for coherence and conciseness. “These responses also showed participants’ exposure to misinformation…”

“Similar to those who said they did not want a vaccine, these respondents also indicate that exposure to recent and prevalent misinformation…”

Discussion You compare the proportion of participants who are sure why they accept vaccines between your current study and other studies. Can you cite those other studies in this sentence?

While your discussion is a good start, I think it is somewhat inadequate and superficial for your findings. Discussions are an opportunity for authors to expand, elaborate, and extrapolate their findings. I don’t think you have done that at all. One reason why I think this is because you have only cited a single study in this section. While the implications section is good, it is also superficial since much of this information is not novel and has already been implemented in jurisdictions worldwide. For example, saying that you need a carefully targeted response, from trusted sources, and in non-technical language are the foundations of knowledge translation and public health education with decades of literature. This leads to the following question: what novel implications do you have? Perhaps the novel implications exist in the minutiae details rather than broad concepts that are somewhat intuitive and obvious to researchers in this area. For this reason, I suggest that you take a deeper dive into some of these concepts, really drawing out the novelty and practical implications that make readers or practitioners take as much out as possible from your wonderful work.

This is a simple questionnaire that addresses a particularly important and current issue i.e. the wide variation of vaccine hesitancy with ethnicity and deprivation.

In many ways, this data seems urgent to publish as it reflects the current UK disparities in COVID-19 and hospitalisations. 

The qualitative treatment of justification for vaccine hesitancy data seems reasonable.

A few concerns: Validity  - as return rate was only 31% - accepting no inappropriate stats used and a semi-quantitive analysis but is this return rate valid?

The survey was carried out in October-December 2020 so precedes the real data and questions about vaccine uptake by a few months. Why is there such a delay between collecting the data and publishing for such a simple MS? Would these answers still be the same, were they reflected in vaccine take up and to what extent?

By a similar argument, the mean age was 42 years so not an age group selected as a vulnerable group on the whole, or offered vaccine early on the whole. This may reflect the commonest comment "not sure about it yet" and therefore more recent data would firm up these suggestions.

Having stated that, the headline data on strong association with deprivation and that only 13% of Pakistan heritage actively want the vaccine is very important.
