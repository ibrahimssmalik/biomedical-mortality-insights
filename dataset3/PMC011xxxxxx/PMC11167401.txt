Nanovaccines represent a pivotal advancement in the field of immunization, utilizing the novel properties of nanoscale materials to enhance vaccine efficacy, safety, and delivery [1-4]. By engineering particles at the nanometer scale, akin to the size of viruses and small molecules, scientists can precisely target and stimulate the immune system in unprecedented ways [5-7]. This approach promises to revolutionize how vaccines are designed, enabling the development of more potent and specific responses against infectious diseases, cancers, and autoimmune disorders [8,9].

The central breakaway of nanovaccines is based on their ability to design pathogens’ size and shape, creating a more realistic playing field for the immune system [2,10]. Biomimicry achieves this and helps the body when exposed to actual threats [11-13]. In addition, nanomaterials can absorb antigens and adjuvants, protecting them from decomposition and enabling them to be released in a controlled manner; this enhances immunogenicity while minimizing side effects [14,15]. Nanovaccines can enable tumor vaccination using needle-free delivery methods such as nasal sprays and oral vaccines, which is a significant advancement [16]. It is beneficial to usage and administration; it also reduces the incidence of needle sewing and possible contamination [17,18]. Nanovaccine is structurally and biologically stable and has the potential to produce formulations that do not need to be stored in the cold chain. It may improve the feasibility of vaccine distribution in an underserved field [4].

However, as promising as these features may seem, the development of effective nanovaccines is encumbered by the necessity of conducting safety studies and the prospects for scalability [6]. Consequently, as the research on the subject continues, increased collaboration between the realms of nanotechnology, immunology, and pharmacology is going to be required [19,20]. Thus, the potential of nanovaccines to protect individuals from multiple conditions will be fully tapped.

Bibliometric analysis is one of the most common approaches applied to scientific research, enabling a quantitative assessment of the literature in different scientific areas, and nanovaccine research is no exception [21-24]. The use of tools such as Biblioshiny and CiteSpace allows exploration of the field’s dynamics, current trends, and prospects. Moreover, their application is especially meaningful in exploring innovations and eligible technologies, ensuring research continuity and confidence concerning its outcomes. By analyzing large datasets related to publications, the researchers may determine publication dynamics, citation behavior, co-authorship, and clusters, as well as conduct mapping of the field and its intellectual and collaborative sides, contributors, and beneficiaries [25-27].

As a result, combining CiteSpace and Biblioshiny, the user-friendly web interface of the Bibliometrix R package, would allow for conducting a comprehensive bibliometric analysis while improving the visualization of data and enhancing its interpretation [28-31]. While Biblioshiny’s bibliometric data may be detailed and cover the growth in the literature, distribution among journals, and frequently cited articles regarding nanovaccine, CiteSpace, in turn, would support the user in identifying and visualizing the trends, shifts in paradigms, and key publications, authors, and journals [32-34]. Additionally, this tool identifies “burst” terms that may be interpreted as an indication of increased interest, which may support the researcher in anticipating future trends in research. Therefore, both the CiteSpace and Biblioshiny tools could be used to navigate the complexity of the nanovaccine field and address the challenges in the healthcare sector.

This study seeks to address the following research questions: (RQ1) What are the core research themes and emerging trends in nanovaccine research?; (RQ2) Who are the key contributors, and what are their collaborative networks in the field of nanovaccine research?; (RQ3) How has the publication output in nanovaccine research evolved over time?; (RQ4) What are the most influential publications in nanovaccine research?; and (RQ5) What are the existing research gaps within nanovaccine?

Materials and methods

Scopus was chosen as this study's primary bibliographical data source because it covers a broader range of quality journals compared to other databases [35-37]. The records were retrieved using the query “( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( nanovaccine ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( nano-vaccine ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "nano vaccine" ) )”. There were no language restrictions; only journal articles, conference papers, and book chapters were considered. A total of 859 documents have been gathered from 280 distinct sources between 2004 and 2024. Figure 1 illustrates the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach to selecting papers for bibliometric analysis. It is a three-phase procedure in which we identify and extract the data for analysis initially from the databases. We excluded reviews, editorials, books, short notes, and surveys in the second phase. Documents included are articles, conference papers, and book chapters. The findings were stored as “CSV” and RIS files, and bibliometric analysis was performed on the data using CiteSpace version 6.2.R3 (Advanced) and Biblioshiny software. The main aspects of this investigation are summarized in Table 1.

Figure 5 A visual indicating the popularity of topics

Thematic Map

The thematic map displayed in Figure 6 visualizes different areas of focus within nanovaccine research, classified by their niche, motor, basic, and emerging or declining status, based on two dimensions: development degree (density) and relevance degree (centrality) [48].

Figure 6 Thematic representation of keywords

Niche themes: These are specialized areas with lower centrality and density, indicating they are not widely researched or central to the field but could represent cutting-edge or very specific areas of study. Here, we have topics like “papillomavirus infections,” “papillomavirus vaccines,” and “wart virus vaccine.” They may be highly specialized topics within nanovaccine research with a narrow scope of study.

Motor themes: These themes are high in both centrality and density, meaning they are well-developed and core to the field. In this case, “Streptococcus pneumoniae,” “pneumococcus vaccine,” and “serotype” are likely to be key drivers of research in the field, receiving a lot of attention and possibly funding.

Basic themes: Situated in the bottom right, these are foundational to the field with high centrality but lower density. They are central to the understanding of the field but may not be the current focus of active research. “Female,” “vaccination,” “adult,” “article,” “human,” and “humans” fall into this category, indicating that while these topics are foundational to nanovaccine research, they might not be at the forefront of current scientific inquiry.

Emerging or declining themes: These topics have low centrality and are on the cusp between low and medium density, suggesting they are either on the rise as new areas of interest or declining as the field moves on to other topics. “Animal experiment,” “animals,” and “animal” are grouped here, indicating that research on nanovaccines related to animal studies might be in a state of flux.

Conceptual Structure Map Using Multiple Correspondence Analysis

The factorial analysis is visual in Figure 7, which maps research themes in nanovaccine research to two principal dimensions, which account for a significant proportion of the variance in the dataset [49]. The first dimension (Dim 1), capturing over 61% of the variance, could represent the technical versus biological focus within the research, while the second dimension (Dim 2), explaining about 24%, might differentiate between the theoretical versus applied nature of the studies.

Figure 7 Conceptual structure map using multiple correspondence analysis

In the green quadrant, which correlates positively with both dimensions, we see terms like “cancer,” “vaccines,” “t cells,” “tumor,” and “immunotherapy.” This suggests a cluster of research that’s highly developed and likely focuses on the application of nanovaccines in cancer therapy, possibly exploring the immunogenicity and therapeutic potential of nanovaccines against tumors.

The red quadrant, with a high Dim 1 and low Dim 2 score, includes “dendritic cells,” “cd8 t lymphocyte,” and “in vitro study,” indicating a focus on the fundamental immune responses at the cellular level and controlled experimental studies in a laboratory setting.

Conversely, the blue quadrant, with a negative score on Dim 1 and a positive score on Dim 2, features “nanovaccine,” “immune response,” “vaccine,” “animal cell,” “animal tissue,” and “in vivo.” These terms may represent more applied research focused on the development and testing of nanovaccines in animal models.

Lastly, the purple dot representing “nanovaccine” at its origin suggests it is a central term in the field that may bridge both technical and biological aspects as well as theoretical and applied research within the context of nanovaccine studies.

Research gaps and practical implications

In the realm of nanovaccine research, a thorough analysis of trend topics and thematic maps uncovers distinct research gaps. There is an opportunity to diversify the spectrum of pathogen-specific nanovaccines, extending beyond well-studied pathogens like “Streptococcus iniae” and “Helicobacter pylori” to encompass a broader range of infectious agents. Moreover, chronic diseases and noninfectious conditions such as autoimmune disorders and allergies remain relatively unexplored territories where nanovaccine applications could offer new therapeutic avenues. Research on niche diseases, including “papillomavirus infections,” reveals a need for tailored nanovaccine solutions targeting less prevalent yet significant health issues. The scarcity of longitudinal studies indicates a gap in our understanding of nanovaccines’ long-term efficacy and safety, a critical factor for their clinical success. Additionally, the concept of personalized nanovaccines, while hinted at through studies on immune molecules like tumor necrosis factors, has yet to become a mainstay in the research landscape.

From a practical perspective, the research has far-reaching implications, most especially in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The prioritization of dendritic and cancer cells suggests that nanovaccines can significantly disrupt treatment modes. The use of biodegradable materials, such as “polyanhydrides,” “lactic acid,” and “polyglycolic acid,” emphasizes the potential of delivery systems that can ensure patient safety and promote adherence. The eradication of radical diseases such as the “dengue virus” and “Yersinia pestis” is equally more visible, pointing to a future in which nanovaccines play a significant role in ending public health crises. Motor themes, such as “Streptococcus pneumoniae,” are prioritized and invested in, as evidenced by research funding channels. In this regard, there is a fluctuating amount of knowledge about animals, suggesting that animal models of research are being reassessed for relevance. In countries such as the United States, Sweden, and Australia, foundational themes are prioritized. It appears that the research will be integrated into human biology, population, and society to enhance vaccine access and articulate public health policy. If these gaps are properly addressed, the benefits will be vast. It will fast-track nanovaccine research and bridge the gap for incredible treatment options for diverse diseases and population age groups.

The bibliometric analysis using only Scopus and focusing on quantitative data comes with certain limitations. Scopus might not capture all relevant studies, particularly from lesser-known journals or in languages other than English, which could leave gaps in the analysis. Also, emphasizing metrics like citation counts could overshadow newer or less recognized research areas. Additionally, this quantitative focus overlooks the qualitative aspects of research, which are essential for a deeper and more nuanced understanding of any field. Including more qualitative analysis could provide vital insights into the context, motivations, and theoretical contributions that quantitative data alone cannot offer.

Conclusions

This bibliometric analysis of nanovaccine research from 2004 to 2024 captures the field’s vibrant and dynamic nature, showcasing significant growth fueled by technological innovations and interdisciplinary collaboration. The field has seen a steady increase in publication trends, highlighting its transformative potential in vaccine development. Despite this progress, there is a notable decline in research focused on nanovaccines for rare and chronic diseases, pointing to critical gaps that need addressing. The study underscores the key contributions from leading countries and institutions, which reflect robust collaborative efforts across various domains, including cancer vaccines and novel delivery systems. However, challenges such as the long-term efficacy and safety of nanovaccines and the need for a broader spectrum of pathogen coverage and applications in chronic diseases remain. Future research should prioritize personalized nanovaccines and the development of safe, innovative delivery methods to enhance patient compliance and address public health needs. Addressing the identified research gaps will be essential for harnessing the full potential of nanovaccines in public health, particularly in preventing and treating diseases with significant public health impacts. The ongoing investment in this field is poised to yield substantial public health benefits, thanks to targeted delivery and biodegradable options that align with public health priorities.
