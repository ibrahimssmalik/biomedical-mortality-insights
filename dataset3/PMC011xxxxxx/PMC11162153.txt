pmcINTRODUCTION

Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) are ubiquitous in daily life, and have numerous applications in pharmaceuticals, food additives, pesticides, flame retardants, electrolytes and detergents [1–5]. They also contribute significantly to fundamental research, particularly in synthetic chemistry [6–8], materials science [9] and abiogenesis [10], propelling the evolution of chemistry and life science (Fig. 1A). The present-day synthesis of OPCs predominately relies on white phosphorus (P4), discovered by German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669 [11]. And now, as the main feedstock chemical, P4 is obtained annually in excess of 1 million tons through the reduction of phosphate rock [12]. In conventional processes, (oxy)chlorination of P4 results in the formation of PCl3, PCl5 and OPCl3, each posing a considerable environmental risk due to their volatile and hazardous liquid nature. Subsequent stages entail the generation of HCl or salt, culminating in the production of a diverse array of value-added fine chemicals [13–15]. Regrettably, this approach not only requires the utilization of toxic liquid chemicals but also confronts challenges associated with the generation of large amounts of waste acids and salts, along with tedious work-up procedures. Another approach toward OPCs is that the reaction of P4 with a strong base generates PH3, which is then functionalized by reactions with alkenes [14,15]. This method suffers from the wasteful utilization of phosphorus atoms, the inherent toxicity and the challenge in handling of PH3 gas (Fig. 1B).

Figure 1. The importance of OPCs and comparison of different routes to commercial OPCs.

In light of the urgent environmental concerns associated with conventional approaches, an alternative route directly converting P4 into OPCs has garnered both scientific significance and practical value. Remarkable progress has been made toward the formerly elusive goal of selectively transforming the P4 molecule in order to avoid the production of downstream chlorinated chemicals [16–19]. The pioneering efforts in this direction date back to the 1960s, employing specific organic molecules and simple organometallic reagents to activate P4 and yield certain OPCs [20]. Nevertheless, these methods encountered challenges of low yields and poor selectivity. In subsequent stages, metal-mediated P4 activation emerged as the predominant approach [21–23]. The allure of this methodology lies in its potential for achieving metal-catalyzed P4 transformation through the coordination and activation of P4 by a metal complex. While early transition metal (TM)-mediated P4 activation can lead to the formation of P‒H and P‒C bonds, the metal-catalyzed process remains a distant prospect. In the past 15 years, the introduction of highly active species, such as carbenes and their analogs, has enabled selective P4 activation [24].

Despite the significant progress in the field of P4 activation making OPCs or organometallic phosphorus compounds, it is still a highly challenging research area. In fact, it generally suffers from: (i) the high electrophilic reactivity of the P4 tetrahedron; (ii) the low selectivity for the P–P bond rupture after the first P–P bond cleavage; and (iii) the low conversion efficiency of the phosphorus atoms in P4 [25]. Consequently, the controllable and atom-efficient functionalization of P4 to construct directly OPCs or organometallic phosphorus compounds is highly desirable. Currently, there are over 30 research groups actively engaged in P4 activation and transformation internationally, mainly distributed in the United States [26–33], Germany [34–44], Russia [45–47], France [48,49], the Netherlands [50,51], the United Kingdom [52–58] and other countries [59–66]. China presently contributes over 70% to the global production of P4. However, the research of P4 activation and transformation in China lags behind. Our group first launched the study in this field in 2014, and the first paper entiteld “Direct Synthesis of Phospholyl Lithium from White Phosphorusˮ was published in 2016 [67]. Since then, we have reported a series of works on direct functionalization of P4 to constuct P‒C bonds [68–77]. In the past 5 years, 10 research groups in China have been involved in P4 activation and transformation [78–100]. Although some reviews have summarized the activation and transformation of P4 from different perspectives [16–25], there is no specific review summarizing progress in China. This timely review outlines the contributions of Chinese research teams in the field of P4 activation (Fig. 1C), and discusses the significance of P4 chemistry along with possible directions for future research. The objective of this review is to inspire increased involvement from researchers in advancing environmentally sustainable methods for P4 activation, fulfilling the desire to completely abandon the environmentally unfriendly industrial chlorination route in the future.

CONSTRUCTION OF P–C BONDS

The construction of P‒C bonds from P4 is of great significance in both industry and academic research. However, due to the complex P–P bond breaking patterns, it is still challenging to construct P‒C bonds from P4 directly with good selectivity. Therefore, finding proper methods to deal with this challenge is necessary. During the past few decades, there has been some development in the construction of P–C bonds from P4 directly, including the reactions of organometallic reagents and organic molecules with P4.

Reactions of P4 with organo-di-lithium reagents

In 2016, we reported for the first time the reaction of P4 with 1,4-dilithio-1,3-butadienes 1, which quantitatively generated phospholyl lithiums 2 through the cooperative nucleophilic attack of two Csp2‒Li bonds on P4 (Fig. 2A) [67]. Di- or tetra-substituted phospholyl lithiums with diverse alkyl, aryl, or silyl groups can be prepared efficiently. Additionally, a novel cooperative insertion mechanism in the reaction of P4 with 1 involving the release of intermediate 3 was proposed and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The understanding of this process will open a new door for the design of straightforward synthesis of OPCs from P4. Then, the aggregation states of phospholyl lithiums were systematically studied, revealing their potential to exist as monomers, dimers, and coordination polymers by changing the substituents and crystallization temperatures [68]. These investigations could be helpful when synthesizing other metal complexes supported by these phospholyl ligands. Furthermore, the [LiP3]n moiety 3 was isolated and characterized as a mixture of phosphorus cluster anions, including Li3P7, Li4P14, Li2P16 and Li4P26 based on X-ray diffraction analysis and 31P{1H} COSY NMR analysis [69]. In 2022, the reaction of P4 with biphenyl dilithio reagents 4 was realized to produce a series of phosphafluorenyl lithiums 5 (Fig. 2B) [70]. The aggregation states of phosphafluorenyl lithiums were initially studied, and the obtained phosphafluorenyl lithiums were key synthetic intermediates for phosphafluorenes. In the same year, we further achieved the derivatization of phosphafluorenyl lithiums. When the one-pot reaction among P4, biphenyl dilithio reagents and ArCOCl or polyfluorobenzenes was carried out, the phosphafluorenyl-based acylphosphine oxides and triarylphosphines were obtained in a chlorine-free method [71]. The acylphosphine oxides and triarylphosphines could be used as radical photoinitiators and organophosphorus ligands.

Reactions of P4 with rare-earth metallacyclopentadienes

Considering that metallacyclopentadienes can both work as double nucleophiles and dienes, we speculated that two M–Csp2 bonds could clip out a P1 fragment, forming a phospholyl anion via the aromatization driving force while the diene skeleton would trap the cyclo-P3 moiety to form an organosubstituted cyclo-P3 compound. Thus, we decided to investigate the reactions of rare-earth metallacyclopentadienes 6 with P4. Using this strategy, we synthesized the first series of rare-earth metal cyclo-P3 complexes 7 and phospholyl anion 2a (Fig. 2C) [72]. In this process, the cleavage of three P‒P bonds and formation of four P‒C bonds for [3 + 1]-fragmentation were observed [73]. Complexes 7 represent the first cyclo-P3 complexes of rare-earth metals and also the first organo-substituted polyphosphides in the category of group 3 and f-block elements. The characterization of 7 suggests that dienes in 6 can trap the cyclo-P3 moiety and confirms the existence of released [LiP3] moiety in the reactions of P4 with 1,4-dilithio-1,3-butadienes 1. To investigate the substituent effect of lutetacyclopentadienes, the reaction of Me, trimethylsilyl (TMS)-substituted lutetacyclopentadiene with P4 was carried out (Fig. 2D) [74]. The expected cyclo-P3 lutetium complex 7d and the aggregated lithium phospholide 8 were obtained. Besides, the sandwich lutetium complex 9 was isolated as a new complex. Interestingly, an unexpected trinuclear rare-earth metal complex 10 with a bicyclo-P64− ligand was also observed in this reaction.

Reactions of P4 with aluminacyclopentadienes

To investigate the importance of metal centers in metallacyclopentadienes for the direct functionalization of P4, the reactions of aluminacyclopentadienes 11 with P4 were carried out. Unexpectedly, the cyclotetraphosphanes 12 featuring four newly formed P–C bonds and a planar square cyclo-P4 ring was obtained selectively (Fig. 2E) [75]. These cyclotetraphosphanes represent an important class of organic polyphosphanes which are not easy to access by other methods.

Photo- and electrochemical transformation of P4

Recent years have witnessed promising outcomes in the photo- and electrochemical transformation of P4. In 2022, the reactions of N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters with P4 were developed by Tang et al. (Fig. 2F) [78]. This process, conducted without TMs or photocatalysts, resulted in a series of dialkyl and trialkyl phosphine oxides under blue light irradiation, with yields up to 92%. This synthetic method features the simple operation, broad substrate scope and high product selectivity. In 2023, another approach to construct dialkylphosphines was reported (Fig. 2G) [79]. Using organic-dye 4CzIPN as the photocatalyst, the unactivated alkyl iodides could react with P4 to generate dialkylphosphines in moderate to good yields. In the same year, we reported a method for the construction of tetrabenzylphosphonium bromide under blue light irridiation (Fig. 2H) [76]. Catalyzed by Cp2TiCl2 and 4CzIPN, the reactions between P4 and benzyl bromides produced a series of quaternary phosphonium salts, applicable in organic synthesis and pharmaceuticals. This marked the introduction of the metallaphotoredox catalysis strategy for the first time in the field of P4 activation. Additionally, we also reported the synthesis of phosphoryltriacetates in 2023 (Fig. 2I) [77]. Using fac-Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456 nm) as the light source, P4 can react with α-bromo esters to generate phosphoryltriacetates in the one-step reaction with moderate to good yields.

Moreover, electrochemical transformation of P4 to OPCs was reported by Liu et al. in 2022 (Fig. 2J) [80]. P4 was first electro-oxidized into [P(CN)2]−, which was subsequently used to synthesize the useful OPCs, such as phospholides and cyclophosphanes. Notably, this method can accomplish the activation of P4 on a gram scale.

CONSTRUCTION OF P–S/N/O BONDS

Heteroatom-containing OPCs, such as phosphorothioates (C–S–P bonds), phosphoramidates (C–N–P bonds), or phosphates (C–O–P), have important applications in the fields of medicinal chemistry, ligands, organocatalysis and agrochemistry [101–103]. The synthetic methods of these compounds mainly involve two routes: (i) the substitution reactions of PCl3, and (ii) the classical coupling reactions, free radical reactions or substitution reactions of specific phosphorus reagents, such as (RO)2P(O)H, P(OR)3 or R2P(O)H, etc. [104–106]. However, it is noteworthy that most phosphorus-containing reagents used in the currently developed methods for the synthesis of OPCs must also be pre-prepared from PCl3.

Construction of P–S/N bonds

In 2019, Tang et al. first reported a photocatalytic reaction of P4 for the construction of P–S bonds (Fig. 3A) [81]. The phosphorotrithioates were synthesized by direct reaction of P4 and thiophenol using Na2EosinY as a photocatalyst. However, the substrate scope of this method was limited, which was only suitable for thiophenol, but mercaptan could not give the corresponding products. Subsequently, they reported the synthesis of phosphorotrithioates under mild conditions with KOH or K2CO3 as base and air as oxidant (Fig. 3B) [82]. Both thiophenol and mercaptan could be tolerated, and the yields were almost quantitative.

The above methods have successfully realized the synthesis of P(SR)3 and P(O)(SR)3 with the same substituents, but the synthetic method of mixed phosphorotrithioates (R1S)2P(O)SR2 was still worth exploring. In 2020, they reported the synthesis of mixed phosphorotrithioates (R1S)2P(O)SR2 by a one-pot, two-step procedure from P4, disulfide and alkyl halides with KOH as the base (Fig. 3C) [83]. The key intermediate in this process is (R1S)2P(S)OK, which was generated by the attack of RSK on S,S,S-trialkyl phosphorotrithioates and subsequent C–S bond cleavage (Michaelis–Arbuzov-like dealkylation reaction). In addition, they considered that penta-coordinate ionic species may be formed during the reaction, which may exchange with KOH to form the P=O bond. To explore this feasibility, amines were introduced in this reaction, which may exchange with the –SPh group to form a P–N bond. Based on this, they reported the efficient four-component synthesis of phosphoramidodithioates from P4, disulfides, amines and KOH (Fig. 3D) [84]. KOH serves both as the base in the reaction and as the source of oxygen atoms in the products. After that, they further synthesized (R1S)2P(S)SR2 with NaSH instead of KOH under reaction conditions similar to Fig. 3C. The NaSH provided the sulfur atoms in the products (Fig. 3E) [85].

Construction of P–O bonds

In 2021, Tang et al. envisioned that the catalytic activation of P4 with (RSe)2 might produce P(SeR)3 species, which can undergo further nucleophilic substitution with ArOH, eventually leading to P(OAr)3 products. Based on that, using (PhSe)2 as the catalyst and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as both the solvent and oxidant, they realized the synthesis of triaryl phosphites and triaryl phosphates from P4 and aryl phenol with almost quantitative yield (Fig. 3F) [86]. The triaryl phosphites could be oxidized with H2O2 or S8 to afford the corresponding oxidation products triaryl phosphates and triaryl thiophosphates. While this work provided a straightforward synthesis of triaryl phosphites, the substrate scope is limited to phenol compounds, and alcohols are not applicable. Dialkylphosphites are widely used as basic starting materials for the synthesis of complex phosphate-based organic compounds. Tang et al. reported the direct synthesis of dialkylphosphites from P4 and alcohol. The reaction was mediated by KBr with KHSO5 (oxone) as the oxidant (Fig. 3G) [87]. In this process, oxone and KBr were employed to in situ produce PBr3 intermediate, thus replacing the traditional PCl3 route.

To avoid the consumption of a large amount of oxidants, Tang et al. developed a waste-free, environmentally friendly method for the synthesis of dialkylphosphites from P4 and alcohols. This approach utilized a combination of photoredox catalyst, nickel catalyst and halide anion under visible light (Condition A; Fig. 3H) [88]. The trialkylphosphate could be obtained by increasing the amount of alcohol and prolonging the reaction time (Condition B; Fig. 3H). This photocatalytic method proved to be effective for various alcohols. Furthermore, it demonstrated suitability for the synthesis of phosphorotrithioates.

α-Aminophosphonates find broad applications in fungicides and enzyme inhibitors. In 2023, Tang et al. reported a Cu-catalyzed three-component reaction among tetrahydroisoquinolines, P4, and alcohols to synthesize α-aminophosphonate with air as a safe oxidant (Fig. 3I) [89]. Furthermore, the method was also suitable for the selective construction of P–O–P compounds (Fig. 3J) [89]. Recently, Tang et al. described a novel and high-yielding method for the synthesis of various phosphorothioates from P4, disulfides and alcohols in one step (Condition A; Fig. 3K) [90]. They hypothesized the formation of phoroselenoate derivatives when replacing diaryl disulfides with diphenyl diselenides. Subsequent nucleophilic substitution with ArOH would result in mixed alkyl/aryl phosphates. Based on this hypothesis, they successfully synthesized the corresponding mixed phosphates using diphenyl diselenides as catalyst and phenol as nucleophile (Condition B; Fig. 3K). This method achieves the simple and efficient synthesis of phosphorothioates with diverse structures.

CONSTRUCTION OF P–M/E BONDS

In the past decade, the activation and transformation of P4 by main group element (E) and metal (M) complexes has attracted intense attention and been subjected to extensive study in the Chinese chemistry community. This is due to their potential utility in the synthesis of OPCs and metal phosphide materials. Various Pn-containing compounds with different nuclearities and geometries have been prepared. It not only provides an environmentally friendly and straightforward route to synthesize high–value-added OPCs without the utilization of poisonous and corrosive chlorine gas but also leads to the production of various metal phosphides with marvelous structures and reactivities [18–25]. It should be noted that the organometallic complexes-mediated P4 activation always involves complex processes, including the cleavage and formation of several bonds. The resulting metal phosphide complexes are intimately related to the type of metal complexes and the coordination environment. Additionally, there is relatively little research on the mechanisms of these processes, highlighting an area where more investigation is needed in the future.

Construction of P–E bonds

The activation of P4 by main group elements is an established field of chemistry [20]. In 2023, Mo et al. reported the synthesis of an elusive homoleptic diphosphene lead complex 14 through controllable degradation of P4 by zero-valent lead complex 13 at ambient temperature (Fig. 4A) [91]. Complex 14 possesses significant π bonding between the Pb atom and diphosphene ligands, with Pb→P2 π-backbonding and P2→Pb σ-donation. The utility of diphosphene as a π-electron donor to stabilize low-valence lead complexes provides a new strategy to develop π-complexes of main group elements.

In the same year, they successfully synthesized a geometrically constrained borylene 15 with the help of a rigid pincer bis(silylene)amido ligand. The reaction of 15 with P4 afforded the product 16 in 85% yield; 16 possesses a BSiP4 cage, which is formed by the insertion of the P4 molecule into the Si–B bond (Fig. 4B) [92].

Construction of P–TM bonds

The TM-mediated activation of P4 has given rise to a plethora of fascinating complexes bearing versatile Pn units. The synthesis of these Pn-containing compounds from P4 necessitates the cleavage of one or more P–P bonds, and possibly the formation of new P–P bonds [19].

In 2022, Deng et al. reported P4 activation with three-coordinate N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-cobalt(0)-alkene complexes 17. This reaction selectively produces the large polyphosphorus cobalt clusters 18 bearing P8 ligands in high yields. These Co2P8 clusters feature short Co–Co bonds (2.39 Å), and P8 ligands exhibit signet-ring type geometry that is unprecedented in synthetic P8 complexes (Fig. 4C) [93]. A series of cage functionalization reactions were conducted and indicated the amphiphilicity of the P8 ligands in 18 toward electrophiles and nucleophiles. A possible mechanism for the formation of 18 was proposed. P4 reacts with one molecule of 17 to generate cyclo-P4 intermediates, which can interact with a second molecule of 17 to afford the chain-P4 species. The chain-P4 species feature two coordinatively unsaturated cobalt centers and can interact with P4 to produce the final products. As an alternative route, the direct dimerization of cyclo-P4 intermediates could also give the P8 complexes. In the same year, Xi et al. synthesized and structurally characterized the dinuclear cobalt dinitrogen complex 19 bearing cyclopentadienyl-phosphine ligands. The two cobalt centers of 19 could undergo oxidative addition of two individual P–P bonds in the P4 moiety resulting in the formation of diamagnetic complex 20 with a cyclo-P4 moiety (Fig. 4D) [94]. Very recently, Xu et al. reported the first example of P4 activation by a group 12 metal-centered complex. They found that the Zn(I)−Zn(I) bonded compound 21 could serve as a two-electron reducing reagent to selectively reduce a number of small molecules, including P4. The reaction of 21 with P4 gave a trinuclear zinc complex 22, which contains a zintl-P7 ligand (Fig. 4E) [95].

Construction of P–RE bonds

A combination of coordinative unsaturation and inherent Lewis acidity of rare-earth (RE) metals, and the strong nucleophilicity of RE−C bonds, endows rare-earth organometallics with a rich reaction chemistry toward P4. Rare-earth metal-mediated P4 activation can lead to the formation of P‒H and P‒C bonds. Hence, this approach has attracted significant interest [27].

In 2019, Zhou et al. synthesized for the first time a rare-earth organonometallic cyclo-P4 complex 24 by direct functionalization of P4 using a rare-earth metal alkyl precursor 23. Heating 24 at 50°C in toluene for 4 days afforded the R2P-substituted cyclo-P3 complex 25 in 90% yield through alkyl migration. This transformation provides a new insight into the stepwise degradation of P4 using metal complexes (Fig. 4F) [96]. In 2023, they reported the reaction of yttrium hydride 26 with P4, which results in the formation of a trinuclear yttrium complex 27 bearing a unique pyramid-like P(PH)3 moiety (Fig. 4G). In contrast, the intramolecular cooperative yttrium hydride/LiPPh2-mediated P4 activation results in the production of two multinuclear heterometal polyphosphorus complexes, one with cyclo-P3 fragment (29) and the other with norborane-P7 fragment (30) (Fig. 4H). These findings showcased the synergistic effect of rare-earth hydride and LiPPh2, introducing a new mode of P4 activation [97].

Very recently, Zhou et al. successfully synthesized two novel rare-earth polyphosphides through the direct P4 activation with rare-earth metal dialkyl complexes 31. Treatment of the yttrium dialkyl complex 31a with P4 in toluene at ambient temperature resulted in the formation of two yttrium polyphosphorus complexes: norbornene-BnP7 complex 32a or chain-Bn4P6 complex 33a, respectively. Notably, the analogous reaction of 31b with P4 in toluene at 40°C only gave 32b. These results illustrated the important influence of the metal centers on the reactivity of the organometallic compounds (Fig. 4I) [98].

In 2022, Ren et al. investigated the reduction of P4 using in situ generated lanthanum and cerium hydrides. Treatment of the lanthanocene or cerocene alkyl complexes 34 with P4 followed by the addition of 9-BBN afforded the trinuclear lanthanide complexes 35a, b with a μ-bridging P73− ligand (Fig. 4J) [99].

Construction of P–An bonds

The study of small molecule activation by actinide (An) elements still lags far behind that of main-group elements and TMs. Reports on the P4 activation by uranium species are rare. In 2021, Zhu et al. reported the formation of a uranium polyphosphide 37 with an E-type P4 chain by treating the uranium chloride 36 with P4 and KC8 in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Computational studies showed that the U(III)–P(III) synergistic effect allows a direct six-electron reduction of P4 (Fig. 4K) [100]. This study further demonstrates the ability of the synergistic strategy between metal centers and ligands to activate P−P bonds, which may inspire the design of new systems for P4 activation.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

The direct conversion of P4 into P-containing compounds holds paramount significance both in terms of fundamental understanding and practical applications. Over the past six decades, substantial progress has been made in directly forming OPCs from P4. Early efforts faced challenges of poor selectivity and low yields due to the unique tetrahedral structure and high reactivity of P4. The prospect of transition metal-catalyzed P4 transformations remain unresolved challenges due to the intricate nature of the reactions between low-valence TMs and P4. By the delicate substrate and pattern design, some highly selective conversions of P4 to OPCs have been developed, yet these reactions are stoichiometric. In recent years, catalytic reactions producing mono-phosphorus compounds from readily available substrates and P4 have made notable progress through photochemical and electrochemical approaches, garnering widespread attention. However, these intriguing reactions still exhibit some drawbacks, such as the need for substantial additives or substrates, difficulties in scaling up, and limited applications of the products. Therefore, the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly systems is imperative. Additionally, exploring new reaction types is essential. In this context, we propose that the following fields can be considered in the future.

Mechanistic studies on P4 degradation

While the conversion of P4 to mono-phosphorus compounds represents a promising direction, the progress in understanding the complex and unclear mechanism of P4 degradation is limited. In-depth mechanistic studies through the combination of in situ characterization techniques and computational chemistry would greatly aid in the development of direct synthesis of mono-phosphorus compounds from P4.

New reaction systems

Most current catalytic processes for OPCs from P4 rely on radical systems. This preference arises from the fact that, compared to other reactive species, radicals are electrically neutral, allowing a single radical to react with P4 to produce neutral organophosphorus product without the consideration of charge conservation. This process always leads to the singularity of P-atom connecting groups. Furthermore, this strategy also suffers from the poor reactivity caused by the low efficiency of free radical formation. Exploring P4 transformations induced by other in situ generated active species, such as carbenes, frustrated radical pairs, etc., is an intriguing research topic.

Electrochemistry

The transformation of P4 into OPCs involves changes in the oxidation state of phosphorus atoms. In terms of redox chemistry, which is frequently encountered when forging new bonds, it is difficult to conceive of a more economical way to add or remove electrons than electrochemistry. Therefore, the development of electrochemical methods for P4 aligns with the requirements of sustainability and economics. Meanwhile, electrochemistry serves as a potent tool for generating active species, holding great promise in the realm of P4 functionalization. One straightforward concept is the reduction of P4 to [P]3− species at the cathode, which can then react with electrophiles in the system to produce the final organic compounds.

In situ transformation via P-protonation, P-sulfenylation or P-chlorination intermediates

Inspired by the work of the conversion of P4 into organophosphate compounds via the P-sulfenylation and P-selenylation intermediates, this strategy can be further expanded. Such a strategy can capitalize on established conversion methodologies, streamlining synthetic procedures, while simultaneously preventing the formation of toxic by-products and waste acids or salts.

Merging C–H activation with P4 transformation

Among the reported catalytic transformations of P4 to OPCs, the prerequisite for substrates to possess leaving groups often results in diminished atom economy. While C–H bond activation has witnessed significant advancements in modern synthetic chemistry, its amalgamation with P4 activation remains a challenging and largely unexplored area. The C–H activation-based transformations of P4 will streamline the synthetic routes to OPCs, significantly enhancing atom economy and synthetic efficiency. For instance, the conventional synthesis of triphenylphosphine involves the use of sodium and chlorobenzene. Direct synthesis of triphenylphosphine from benzene and P4 would yield substantial economic and environmental benefits.

Machine learning for P4 activation

The application of machine learning in the fields of chemistry and materials science is rapidly expanding, bringing unprecedented innovation and progress to these disciplines. In the realm of P4 activation, machine learning can be employed for the design of reaction pathways, enhancement of catalyst performance, optimization of reaction conditions, etc., thereby accelerating the discovery of environmentally friendly and efficient methods for P4 transformation.

Homogeneous–heterogeneous synergy strategy for P4 activation

Heterogeneous chemical reactions excel at facile cleavage of inert bonds, whereas homogeneous chemical reactions are adept at synthesizing fine chemicals. In recent years, a strategy combining homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches has been successfully applied to the synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds from N2 [107,108]. If this new strategy could be implemented in the field of P4 activation, it would offer fresh opportunities for the direct synthesis of high-value OPCs from P4 and simple organic molecules.
