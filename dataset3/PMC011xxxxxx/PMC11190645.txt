Background

The hazel or common dormouse, Muscardinus avellanarius Linnaeus 1758, is brown to ochre-coloured and has a furred tail. It can be as small as 7 cm, and lives arboreally in forests of all types and age classes, including pure spruce forests, park landscapes and riverine forests as well as hedges and shrubberies. The animals hibernate in self-constructed nests on the ground or between rootstocks, and sometimes in nestboxes. The hazel dormouse feeds on seeds, flower buds, berries and other fruits, and nuts, especially hazelnuts. Hazel dormice have a mostly vegetarian diet, but in early summer up to 50 % of the food can consist of insects. It is the only extant species of the genus Muscardinus.

The hazel dormouse is found in northern Europe and Asia Minor and is strictly protected in Europe under the Habitat Directive (annex IV) and Bern Convention (annex III). It is the only dormouse native to Britain, where it is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act since its reintroduction in 1993 as part of the English Nature Species Recovery Programme. It is an introduced species to Ireland. In the 2006 European report ( Kryštufek et al., 2007) as well as the 2016 global assessment ( Hutterer et al., 2021) of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the hazel dormouse is listed as ‘least concern’. The German Red List has the hazel dormouse as ‘near threatened’, with current observations being rare and a moderate declining trend in the long-term in the population ( Meinig et al., 2020). The hazel dormouse is threatened by woodland habitat loss and the resulting fragmentation as well as changes in woodland management practices since it depends on forests in combination with hedges and bushes, as dormice do not cross large, open spaces.

Based on mitochondrial markers, Mouton et al. (2012) identified two highly divergent M. avellanarius lineages (lineage 1 in France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy, lineage 2 in Poland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Balkan Peninsula and Turkey) and low genetic diversity within the lineages. This underlines the importance of further genomic studies to define conservation units for this species.

Here we present a chromosomally complete genome sequence for Muscardinus avellanarius based on one male specimen from Friesheimer Busch, Germany.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one male Muscardinus avellanarius ( Figure 1) collected from Friesheimer Busch, Germany. A total of 58-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 34 missing joins or mis-joins, reducing the scaffold number by 6.58%.

Figure 1. Hazel dormouse ( Muscardinus avellanarius) on a Firethorn (Pyracantha coccinea) by Danielle Schwarz (CC-BY).

The final assembly has a total length of 2497.5 Mb in 212 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 119.5 Mb ( Table 1). The snailplot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of assembly scaffolds on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (99.78%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 24 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 22 autosomes and the X and Y sex chromosomes. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

The sequenced individual Muscardinus avellanarius (specimen ID SAN00002415, ToLID mMusAve1) was found dead in Friesheimer Busch, Germany on 2021-07-21 and then frozen in a regular –20 °C freezer. Astrid Böhne, Christine Thiel-Bender and Sandra Kukowka collected and identified the species. Subsamples for genome sequencing were taken from the frozen individual with minimal thawing and transferred to dry ice and subsequent storage at –80 °C until further processing. The appropriation of a dead found hazel dormouse and subsequent usage for research was granted by the responsible authority Untere Naturschutzbehörde Rhein-Erft Kreis as an exemption to §45 ABS4 Bundesnaturschutzgesetz Germany.

The workflow for high molecular weight (HMW) DNA extraction at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI) includes a sequence of core procedures: sample preparation; sample homogenisation; DNA extraction; HMW DNA fragmentation; and fragmented DNA clean-up. The mMusAve1 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice with tissue set aside for Hi-C sequencing (as per the protocol at https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.x54v9prmqg3e/v1). For sample homogenisation, thorax tissue was cryogenically disrupted using the Sample Homogenisation: Covaris cryoPREP® Automated Dry Pulverizer protocol ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.eq2lyjp5qlx9/v1). HMW DNA was extracted by means of the Automated MagAttract protocol ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.kxygx3y4dg8j/v1). HMW DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30, following the HMW DNA Fragmentation: Diagenode Megaruptor®3 for PacBio HiFi protocol ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.8epv5x2zjg1b/v1). Sheared DNA was purified following either the Manual solid-phase reversible immobilisation (SPRI) protocol ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.kxygx3y1dg8j/v1), or the Automated SPRI protocol ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.q26g7p1wkgwz/v1) for higher throughput. In brief, the method employs a 1.8X ratio of AMPure PB beads to sample to eliminate shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

Protocols employed by the Tree of Life laboratory are publicly available on protocols.io: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.8epv5xxy6g1b/v1.

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on a Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) instrument. Hi-C data were also generated from tissue of mMusAve1 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected using the using the TreeVal pipeline ( Pointon et al., 2022). Manual curation was performed using JBrowse2 ( Diesh et al., 2023), HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

This manuscript presents the genome sequence of the hazel dormouse. The assembly is in very good shape, with high contiguity and chromosome-level scaffolding. It comfortably exceeds the VGP-2020 standards and represents a useful genomic resource for this, and related, organisms. Overall, the presentation of the data is thorough and clear. I only have a few minor comments for consideration. Abstract: "Most of the assembly is scaffolded into 24 chromosomal pseudomolecules, including the X and Y sex chromosomes."

- I think this undersells the quality of the genome, which has less than 0.25% unplaced (Table 1).

Introduction: “... and lives arboreally in forests of all types and age classes,”

- Would it be more accurate to say “temperate forests of all types”? From a global perspective, I don’t think this statement is true. It does not live in rainforests, for example.

Page 3: "Muscardinus avellanarius based on one male specimen from Friesheimer Busch, Germany" - it might be worth clarifying that this is an individual from Lineage 2. (Was this checked?)

Page 3, typo: “... corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited.The mitochondrial genome…” - space needed between “deposited.” and “The”.

Table 1: I note that the BUSCO Duplication rate is quite high at 2.9%. Is this typical for the lineage, or is a consequence of having both X and Y in the assembly?

Figure 5: It would be useful to have the chromosomes labeled, as the order in Figure 5 and Table 2 are not the same. The X chromosome has a clear lack of contacts. Is this because it is represented at half-depth in the HiC data? The 3’ end of some of the chromosomes appears to be lacking HiC signal. Is this expected? Some of the chromosome ends also appear to be incorrectly aligned with the HiC signal, e.g. Chromosomes 5, 6, X and 7. This appears to be just a plotting issue, as the interactive map looked fine. Is it possible to fix the plot in the figure?

Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?

Yes

Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?

The article presents a genome assembly of the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius, a species of small rodent found in Europe and Asia Minor. The genome sequence was obtained from a single male specimen collected in Germany. The assembly spans 2,497.5 megabases and includes 24 chromosomal pseudomolecules, covering the X and Y sex chromosomes. The mitochondrial genome has also been assembled. The genome sequence provides significant insights into the genetic makeup of the hazel dormouse and could be instrumental in conservation efforts, given its protected status and the threats it faces due to habitat loss and fragmentation.

1. Rationale for creating the dataset(s):

The article convincingly argues for the importance of genomic data in conservation biology, particularly for the hazel dormouse, which faces threats from habitat loss and fragmentation. The genomic data can help in understanding genetic diversity and structuring conservation units, which is crucial for effective conservation strategies. This rationale is well-supported by references to previous studies and the species' conservation status.

2. Protocols and technical soundness:

The technical approach is robust, involving high-coverage sequencing and advanced assembly techniques. The use of Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads and chromosome conformation Hi-C data ensures high-quality assembly. The manual curation of the assembly to correct mis-joins further enhances the reliability of the data. The technical soundness is evidenced by the high Quality Value (QV) and the BUSCO completeness score, indicating a comprehensive and accurate assembly.

3. Details of methods and materials:

The methods section is detailed, covering all aspects from sample acquisition to DNA extraction and sequencing. The protocols are cited with DOIs, providing easy access to the procedures followed. This level of detail is sufficient for replication, as it includes information on sample preparation, DNA fragmentation, and sequencing technologies used.

4. Presentation of datasets:

The datasets are presented in a clear and accessible manner. The article includes figures such as the BlobToolKit Snailplot and GC-coverage plot, which visually summarize the assembly metrics. The data is deposited in public repositories, with accession numbers provided for easy access. The comprehensive presentation ensures that the datasets can be readily used by other researchers.

The article successfully presents a high-quality genome assembly of the hazel dormouse, providing a valuable resource for conservation biology.

I am reaching out to you today with a statement of my enthusiastic backing for the manuscript titled "The genome sequence of the hazel dormouse, Muscardinus avellanarius (Linnaeus, 1758)" which was under my review. My perception of this work is that it has been thoughtfully formulated, meticulously executed and highly perceptive. I have recognized how the authors provided noteworthy insights pertaining to our comprehension on this species making it an important contribution. The authors also did an excellent job of discussing their findings in the context of the existing literature. I am confident that this manuscript will be of great interest to readers of Wellcome Open Research. I highly recommend that it be considered for indexing.

In addition to the strengths mentioned above, and given the fact that I don't consider myself an authority on this particular type of organism, here are some observations regarding your project.

… “The genome was sequenced from one male Muscardinus avellanarius (Figure 1) collected from Friesheimer Busch, Germany. A total of 58-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 34 missing joins or mis-joins, reducing the scaffold number by 6.58%.”…

Strength:

The utilization of Pacific Biosciences' single-molecule HiFi long reads, which have the ability to cover vast stretches measuring in hundreds of thousands of bases, is a major asset. Its implementation allows for the compilation of intricate sections such as repetitive sequences and

centromeres that prove daunting for standard short-read sequencing techniques. Another advantage is the integration of chromosome conformation Hi-C data to arrange primary assembly contigs. The Hi-C data records the physical connections among DNA segments, offering useful insights into arranging and aligning contigs on chromosomes.

Cautions/considerations:

Although it is a typical beginning for genome sequencing initiatives, it's crucial to acknowledge the likelihood of constraints in capturing the genetic variability found among individuals within this species. To attain an all-embracing comprehension of Muscardinus avellanarius' genome, including more study subjects from distinct populations would be advantageous. The completeness of the assembled genome is not directly indicated in the passage. However, it is imperative to evaluate this aspect so as to establish how much of Muscardinus avellanarius' entire genome has been acquired. Such knowledge holds great significance for downstream analyses and interpretations. The crucial step of identifying and characterizing genes as well as other functional elements, referred to as genome annotation, is not discussed for Muscardinus avellanarius. Such an undertaking greatly aids in comprehending the organism's genetic composition and biological processes.

" … The final assembly has a total length of 2497.5 Mb in 212 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 119.5 Mb (Table 1). The snailplot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of assembly scaffolds on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (99.78%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 24 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 22 autosomes and the X and Y sex chromosomes.

Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size (Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was

also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission ..."

Although the assembly is presented as a single haplotype, its phasing remains incomplete. To facilitate research on heterozygosity and genome-wide association studies, it's crucial to establish allelic sequence arrangement for each chromosome through phasing.

Strength:

The confidence in accuracy and contiguity of the assembly is reinforced through chromosome-scale scaffolds validation employing Hi-C data.

Cautions/considerations:

Although the assembly is deposited as a single haplotype, it lacks complete phasing. Phasing plays a crucial role in researching heterozygosity by determining the sequence of alleles on each chromosome. The passage does not directly mention the thoroughness of the gathered genome.

Evaluating the comprehensiveness of this assembly is vital in establishing how much of Muscardinus avellanarius's entirety has been encompassed. The passage does not explicitly discuss the extent to which the genome has been compiled comprehensively. To determine how much of Muscardinus avellanarius's entirety has been included, it is crucial to assess the thoroughness of this collection.
