Abstract

Background

Healthy behaviors are paramount in preventing long‐term adverse health outcomes in childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer survivors. We systematically reviewed and synthesized existing literature on barriers, facilitators, and other factors associated with health behaviors in this population.

Methods

MEDLINE and PsycInfo were searched for qualitative and quantitative studies including survivors aged 16–50 years at study, a cancer diagnosis ≤25 years and ≥2 years post diagnosis. Health behaviors included physical activity, smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, sun exposure, and a combination of these behaviors (defined as health behaviors in general).

Results

Barriers, facilitators, and other factors reported in ≥2 two studies were considered relevant. Out of 4529 studies, 27 were included (n = 31,905 participants). Physical activity was the most frequently examined behavior (n = 12 studies), followed by smoking (n = 7), diet (n = 7), alcohol (n = 4), sun exposure (n = 4), and health behavior in general (n = 4). Relevant barriers to physical activity were fatigue, lack of motivation, time constraints, and current smoking. Relevant facilitators were perceived health benefits and motivation. Influence of the social environment and poor mental health were associated with more smoking, while increased energy was associated with less smoking. No relevant barriers and facilitators were identified for diet, alcohol consumption, and sun exposure. Barriers to healthy behavior in general were unmet information needs and time constraints whereas lifestyle advice, information, and discussions with a healthcare professional facilitated healthy behavior in general. Concerning other factors, women were more likely to be physically inactive, but less likely to drink alcohol and more likely to comply with sun protection recommendations than men. Higher education was associated with more physical activity, and lower education with more smoking.

Conclusion

This knowledge can be used as a starting point to develop health behavior interventions, inform lifestyle coaches, and increase awareness among healthcare providers regarding which survivors are most at risk of unhealthy behaviors.

pmc1 INTRODUCTION

The number of childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer survivors is increasing due to survival rates of up to approximately 80% in high‐income countries. 1 , 2 Unfortunately, 75% of long‐term CAYA cancer survivors experience adverse health outcomes later in life, such as cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disease, metabolic syndrome, cancer‐related fatigue, anxiety, and depression. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 These health outcomes can lead to hospitalization, disability, reduced quality of life, and premature mortality. 9

Unhealthy behaviors—including insufficient physical activity, smoking, an unbalanced diet, excessive alcohol consumption, and unprotected sun exposure—are associated with an increased risk of developing adverse health outcomes in CAYA cancer survivors. 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 Health behavior change interventions are effective and feasible in reducing these risks. 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 Consequently, the adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors has become paramount in the prevention of long‐term adverse health outcomes in CAYA cancer survivors.

However, CAYA cancer survivors may face specific barriers and facilitators when trying to adopt healthy behaviors. For example, physical limitations resulting from cancer treatment, chronic pain, and fatigue may hinder engagement in physical activity. 22 , 23 On the contrary, survivors might be more aware of their elevated health risks, which may increase their motivation to change their behavior. 24 Positive or negative attitudes and beliefs also play an important role in shaping survivors' willingness to adopt healthy behaviors. 25 , 26

In order to develop targeted interventions tailored to the individual needs and preferences of CAYA cancer survivors, more knowledge is needed about the barriers, facilitators, and other factors associated with their health behaviors. In addition, a comprehensive understanding of the barriers, and facilitators that influence the different health behaviors of CAYA cancer survivors can inform guidelines and help healthcare providers (HCPs) involved in survivorship care to promote healthy habits. Knowledge about other factors, such as sociodemographic, treatment‐ and clinical factors, can be used to raise awareness among CAYA cancer survivors at high risk of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize the existing evidence on the relevant barriers, facilitators, and other factors associated with health behaviors in CAYA cancer survivors.

2 METHODS

2.1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

2.1.1 Study designs

All study designs were eligible for inclusion except narrative and systematic reviews and case reports. We only included quantitative studies that reported multivariable models, as these provide more robust analyses and better control for confounding variables, increasing the reliability of the results. In addition, only English‐language studies published after 2000 were included, as earlier research largely overlooked the impact of health behavior on late adverse health outcomes.

2.1.2 Participants

To ensure inclusivity without compromising reliability and to account for differences in international definitions of age thresholds for childhood cancer, studies were eligible if ≥75% of the study population was diagnosed with cancer <25 years of age, ≥50% of the population was ≥2 years after their primary cancer diagnosis, and participants were aged 16–50 years at the time of study. Studies including participants still undergoing cancer treatment were excluded. Studies with mixed samples (e.g., survivors aged < and ≥25 years at diagnosis) were included if results allowed separation.

2.1.3 Outcomes

Outcomes were barriers, facilitators, and other factors associated with physical activity, smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, sun exposure, and a combination of health behaviors (health behavior in general). Barriers were interpreted as influencing the persistence of unhealthy behaviors or hindering/limiting healthy behaviors, whereas facilitators were interpreted as factors supporting engagement in healthier behaviors. In addition, barriers and facilitators were interpreted as potentially modifiable, for example, through lifestyle interventions. Other variables that were associated with health behavior and behavior change but were considered non‐modifiable or very difficult to modify were categorized separately as other factors, that is, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Factors that influence the persistence of unhealthy behaviors or hinder/limit healthy behaviors were termed “risk factors”, while factors that support engagement in healthier behaviors were termed “supportive factors”.

We distinguished between outcomes derived from qualitative and/or (semi‐)quantitative survey studies and those derived from quantitative studies, including observational or (semi)experimental studies with measures of association as outcomes. All suboutcomes, such as—in the case of smoking—smoking cessation, smoking rate, and quit attempts, were aggregated to the primary health behavior of interest, that is, smoking.

2.2 Search strategy for identification of studies

We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE (Ovid until 15 April 2021 and PubMed from 15 April 2021 to 26 April 2023 for the updated search) and PsycInfo until 15 April 2021 (Appendix B). Reference lists of included studies and reviews were searched for studies not included in the electronic database searches. All authors were asked to identify any missing studies that had not been identified in the previous searches.

2.3 Study selection

After removing duplicates, two independent reviewers assessed the titles and abstracts using Rayyan (https://rayyan.ai). Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were retrieved for full‐text review. The reviewers discussed discrepancies that arose at either stage. Third party arbitration was not required. Two studies by Emmons et al. partially overlapped: Emmons et al. (2003) described the baseline data collection and intervention design of the Partnership for Health Study, and Emmons et al. (2005) described the outcomes of the intervention. 20 , 27 As both studies met the inclusion criteria, we included them in our review.

2.4 Data extraction

Standardized evidence tables (Appendix S1) were created to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data collection. These evidence tables included information on study design, participant characteristics, and outcomes. The tables were prepared by one author and checked by another author. In case of discrepancies or disagreements, the authors agreed by discussion.

2.5 Data synthesis

We have summarized the results in two separate tables: one for barriers and facilitators from qualitative and (semi‐)quantitative studies (Table 1) and one for significant barriers, facilitators, and other factors from quantitative studies (Table 2). These tables contain information about the study design, the participants and a summary of findings. Additionally, we created two overview tables (Tables 3 and 4) for all the barriers, facilitators, and other factors extracted from Tables 1 and 2. We categorized the barriers, facilitators, and other factors outlined in Tables 3 and 4 based on their content to enhance clarity and readability. Furthermore, we presented tables 3 and 4 using a three‐level color scheme. Barriers/risk factors preventing changes from unhealthy to healthy behaviors are shown in red, while facilitators/supportive factors associated with healthier behavior are shown in green. Darker colors indicate higher frequencies of specifically identified barriers, facilitators, or other factors on a 3‐point scale. Barriers, facilitators, and other factors reported in at least two studies were considered relevant and are described in the results.

3 RESULTS

After removing duplicates, 4529 abstracts were identified and screened. Next, 141 full‐text articles were assessed for inclusion in the review. Eight studies were identified by screening the reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews, and four studies were identified by experts in the field. Finally, 27 studies met all eligibility criteria (Figure 1). Nine were qualitative or semiquantitative studies and 18 were quantitative studies. Study designs included interviews (n = 1), a combination of interviews and focus groups (n = 2), elicitation surveys (n = 2), a pilot intervention study (n = 1), randomized trials (n = 2), cohort studies (n = 3), cross‐sectional survey studies (n = 15), and a retrospective multi‐institution survey study (N = 1). Sample sizes ranged from 13 to 10,398, with a total of 31,905 participants across all included studies. All studies were conducted between 2003 and 2023. Five studies reported on more than one health behavior. 34 , 37 , 48 , 49 , 52

3.1 Barriers, facilitators, and other factors associated with health behaviors (Tables 3 and 4)

3.1.1 Physical activity (n = 12 studies, n = 15,588 participants)

Twenty‐one barriers, 17 facilitators, 17 risk factors, and 10 supportive factors associated with physical activity were reported in the included studies. Barriers reported in at least two studies were fatigue (n = 5 25 , 26 , 34 , 35 , 37 ), lack of motivation (n = 4 25 , 26 , 31 , 34 ), time constraints (n = 4 25 , 26 , 31 , 37 ), being a current smoker (n = 3 38 , 39 , 47 ), a lack of knowledge and skills (n = 2 25 , 26 ); fear of injury (n = 2 25 , 34 ); lack of finances (e.g., for a gym membership; n = 2 26 , 31 ), being underweight (n = 2 38 , 39 ), being overweight (n = 2 34 , 38 ), being obese (n = 2 38 , 39 ), and experiencing physical limitations (n = 2, e.g., poor balance or lack of fitness 26 , 34 ). Facilitators for physical activity reported in at least two studies were perceived health benefits (n = 2 25 , 26 ) and (self)‐motivation (n = 2 31 , 35 ).

Relevant risk factors for physical activity were female sex (n = 3 38 , 47 ), a treatment history including radiotherapy (n = 2 38 , 50 ), having children (n = 2 31 , 39 ), lower educational level (n = 2 39 , 47 ), and being of Hispanic, Black, or other non‐Hispanic ethnicity (n = 2 38 , 47 ). In contrast, higher levels of education (n = 3 35 , 38 , 39 ) was a supportive factor for physical activity.

3.1.2 Smoking (n = 7 studies, n = 5420 participants)

Seven barriers, six facilitators, five risk factors, and 12 supportive factors were associated with smoking in the included studies. Barriers reported in at least two studies were negative influence of the social environment (n = 2, e.g., smoking in the household or a higher proportion of smokers in the social network 27 , 44 ) and poor mental health (n = 2 27 , 42 ). On the contrary, increased energy (n = 2 20 , 26 ) was identified as a facilitator in at least two studies. In terms of factors, lower educational attainment (n = 2 27 , 34 ) was a risk factors for smoking.

3.1.3 Diet (n = 7 studies, n = 3695 participants)

Six barriers (e.g., not liking the taste of certain foods), seven facilitators (e.g., peer support), two risk factors (e.g., Hispanic or Black ethnicity), and 10 supportive factors (e.g., female sex) were associated with diet in one of the included studies. No barriers, facilitators, or factors were reported in at least two studies.

3.1.4 Alcohol consumption (n = 4 studies, n = 11,032 participants)

Three barriers, one facilitator, seven risk factors, and four supportive factors associated with (reducing) alcohol consumption were reported in the included studies. No barriers or facilitators were reported in at least two studies. However, in terms of factors, men had significantly higher levels of alcohol consumption than women, especially with regard to binge drinking (n = 2 43 , 48 ).

3.1.5 Sun exposure (n = 4 studies, n = 754 participants)

The included studies reported zero barriers, two facilitators, four risk factors, and three supportive factors associated with (increased) sun exposure. No barriers or facilitators were reported in at least two studies. However, women were significantly more likely than men to adhere to sun exposure recommendations (n = 3 34 , 46 , 49 ).

3.1.6 Health behavior in general (n = 4 studies, n = 403 participants)

Twelve barriers and 19 facilitators associated with health behavior in general were identified in the included studies. Barriers identified in at least two studies were unmet information needs (n = 2 29 , 30 ) and time constraints (n = 2 29 , 30 ). Lifestyle advice and information (n = 3 28 , 29 , 30 ) and having a health promotion conversation with a healthcare professional (n = 2 28 , 30 ) were identified as facilitators in at least two studies. There were no other factors associated with health behavior in general.

3.1.7 Nonsignificant results

For the quantitative studies, Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 include only the significant results. Non‐significant results are reported in Appendix S2. Across all health behavior outcomes (NB: a single study may examine multiple outcomes), the most nonsignificant results were found for age at diagnosis (n = 17 28 , 34 , 39 , 40 , 46 , 49 ), cancer diagnosis (n = 14 28 , 39 , 43 , 46 , 49 ), attained age (n = 14 20 , 28 , 34 , 39 , 40 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 49 , 51 ), cancer treatment (n = 12 28 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 46 , 49 , 51 ), sex (n = 11 20 , 34 , 39 , 44 , 48 , 49 , 51 ), race/ethnicity (n = 9 28 , 36 , 41 , 43 , 46 , 49 ), and household income (n = 7 28 , 34 , 46 ). None of the significant results identified in the included studies were outweighed by a greater number of nonsignificant results. In other words, the results described in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 were all found to be statistically significant more often than statistically nonsignificant.

4 DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this systematic review is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence on barriers, facilitators, and other factors associated with health behaviors in CAYA cancer survivors. Physical activity was the most commonly studied health behavior in this systematic review. The most frequently identified barriers to physical activity were fatigue, time constraints, lack of motivation, current smoking, lack of knowledge and skills, fear of injury, financial constraints, being either underweight, overweight, or obese, and experiencing physical limitations. Of note, feeling fatigued may reduce physical activity, but regular physical activity may in its turn reduce cancer‐related fatigue. 51 , 53 Female sex was the most commonly identified risk factor associated with lower levels of physical activity, followed by a treatment history including radiotherapy, having children, having less education, and being of Hispanic, black, or other non‐Hispanic ethnicity. Facilitators for physical activity included perceived health benefits and levels of motivation. Higher education was the only supportive factor associated with increased physical activity in at least two studies.

Systematic reviews in people without cancer found comparable correlates of physical activity, including sex, having knowledge/appreciation of the benefits of physical activity, (lack of) motivation, smoking, access to facilities, lack of time, lack of energy, and having underlying health problems. 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 Besides, Brown and colleagues recently synthesized evidence from eight qualitative studies of barriers and facilitators to physical activity from the perspective of childhood cancer survivors. 58 Parental influence and support were found to be major themes, possibly because parental factors were the main focus of two of the included studies. The current review adds to these findings by synthesizing evidence from both qualitative and quantitative studies, including the impact of sociodemographic, cancer and treatment‐related factors on survivors' physical activity levels.

Higher smoking rates among CAYA cancer survivors were related to lower levels of education, poor mental health, and having more peers or household members who smoke. In contrast, increased energy was associated with lower smoking rates. Men were more likely than women to have higher levels of alcohol consumption. These findings are consistent with the literature on smoking and alcohol consumption in the general population 59 , 60 , 61 and highlight the importance of sociodemographic factors such as sex and educational level in identifying those at risk of unhealthy behaviors. Furthermore, as smoking and mental health are linked through the withdrawal effect of tobacco, HCPs can explain to smokers that the decrease in nicotine levels after smoking a cigarette leads to withdrawal symptoms such as poor concentration, insomnia, feelings of tension, restlessness, low mood, and anxiety. 60 One strategy that can be used to support smoking cessation is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps people understand the relationships between their thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and physical experiences. 60 CBT can also be used for improving other health behaviors.

This review also found that women were more likely than men to adhere to sun exposure recommendations, with the exception of occasional sun exposure. This is consistent with research in the general population suggesting that men are more likely to perceive the inconvenience and cost of sunscreen and sun‐protective clothing as barriers to their sun‐protective behavior. 62 In addition, men tend to perceive skin damage from sun exposure as less severe than women do. 62

We did not find any barriers, facilitators, or other factors associated with a healthy diet that were identified by two or more studies. In the general population, systematic reviews found that social environment plays an important role in dietary health behavior, along with automaticity, self‐regulation, motivational regulation, subjective norm, and relationships with sedentary behavior. 63 , 64 However, the evidence is suggestive at best, because of the widespread use of cross‐sectional designs in the studies included in the reviews. More research is therefore needed to understand the barriers and facilitators associated with a healthy diet among both the general population and, particularly, CAYA cancer survivors.

4.1 Health behavior interventions and identification of survivors most at risk

The barriers and facilitators identified in this review can be used as a starting point for developing health behavior interventions that meet the needs and preferences of individual CAYA cancer survivors and support them in adopting healthier lifestyles. For example, a targeted health behavior intervention can help survivors to manage their clinical symptoms of fatigue and time constraints, and increase their motivation by addressing their individual preferences and needs and by emphasizing the benefits of healthy lifestyles. A recent systematic review and meta‐analysis on healthy lifestyle interventions found that current health behavior interventions are primarily exercise‐based without significant effects on physical outcomes such as physical fitness, fatigue, and body mass index. 65 Therefore, a different, more holistic and individualized approach to health behavior interventions is warranted. 66 Overall, further clinical trials are needed to increase the body of research on effective health behavior interventions for CAYA cancer survivors. Such interventions should build on the accumulated evidence on barriers and facilitators and address strategies to overcome fatigue, increase and sustain motivation over time, and include aspects of time management techniques. Moreover, engaging key stakeholders such as survivors, HCPs, and policymakers at the initial stages of intervention development increases the likelihood of creating interventions that are not only delivered on time and within budget but also deemed acceptable and feasible. 67

The insights in relevant risk and supportive factors associated with health behaviors can help to increase awareness among HCPs regarding which survivors are most at risk of certain unhealthy behaviors. However, the consistent lack of statistical significance observed for risk and supportive factors related to cancer history and treatment, such as age at diagnosis, cancer diagnosis, and cancer treatment, highlights the possibility that these specific factors may not be of substantial importance in relation to health behaviors in CAYA cancer survivors. In other words, this review indicates that the primary results identified are not inherently specific to CAYA cancer survivors. Consequently, HCPs and lifestyle coaches may need to broaden their focus beyond medical history when assisting CAYA cancer survivors to improve their health behaviors and adopt new habits. For instance, other individual characteristics such as sex and educational attainment should be taken into account.

4.2 The importance of knowledge dissemination

This review highlights the importance of increasing knowledge about healthy behaviors in general among CAYA cancer survivors through health behavior advice, information dissemination, and health promotion discussions with HCPs. These findings align with a recent qualitative study of HCPs, which highlighted the critical role of education and training of HCPs in effectively guiding CAYA cancer survivors toward healthy behaviors. 68 Survivorship care clinics should prioritize the integration of health behavior support services such as lifestyle coaching and ensure that HCPs are adequately equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to support survivors in adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors. In addition, a systematic review of 17 randomized controlled trials among all types of patients showed that using deliberate communication strategies when providing information can improve patient outcomes more effectively than not using such strategies. 69 Therefore, when HCPs aim to encourage survivors to engage in specific health behaviors, they may particularly benefit from using explicit persuasive information strategies.

4.3 Strengths and limitations

The methodology used in this review had several strengths. First, we followed a rigorous and transparent approach, including a comprehensive search strategy and the involvement of two independent reviewers in the screening of studies and data extraction. We included both quantitative and qualitative studies to enrich the scope and depth of our review. However, this review brings together very different study designs and methodologies such as studies reporting on survivors' perceived influences on behavior and cohort studies reporting on risk factors. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution and used as a starting point to develop health behavior interventions and identify survivors most at risk of unhealthy behaviors. Furthermore, our strict inclusion criteria limited the age range of participants to 16–50 years. As a result, we might have missed relevant findings from studies that included participants outside this age range and AYA cancer survivors with an adult cancer diagnosis. This may somewhat limit the generalizability of our conclusions. Nevertheless, our findings are still valuable for understanding the barriers and facilitators that may promote healthy behaviors in CAYA cancer survivors.

5 CONCLUSION

Our comprehensive review examined different aspects of health behavior, including physical activity, smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, sun exposure, and health behavior in general. Barriers, such as fatigue, unmet information needs, time constraints, lack of motivation, social influences, poor mental health, and facilitators, such as the need for lifestyle advice and health promotion discussions with HCPs, highlight the importance of targeted interventions. The identification of other factors associated with health behavior outcomes, including (among others) sex and educational attainment, highlights the need to consider individual context and sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, our findings can be used as a starting point for the development of more targeted and effective health behavior change interventions to promote healthy behaviors in CAYA cancer survivors, to support them in adapting these behaviors, and to inform lifestyle coaches. Knowledge of other factors can be used to raise awareness among HCPs of which survivors are most at risk of unhealthy behaviors.
