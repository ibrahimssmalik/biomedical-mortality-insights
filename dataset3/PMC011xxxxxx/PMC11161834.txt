Abstract

Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) are produced from all regions of the eucaryotic genome. We used inverse PCR of non-B microsatellites capable of forming hairpin, triplex, quadruplex and AT-rich structures integrated at a common ectopic chromosomal site to show that these non-B DNAs generate highly mutagenized eccDNAs by replication-dependent mechanisms. Mutagenesis occurs within the non-B DNAs and extends several kilobases bidirectionally into flanking and nonallelic DNA. Each non-B DNA exhibits a different pattern of mutagenesis, while sister clones containing the same non-B DNA also display distinct patterns of recombination, microhomology-mediated template switching and base substitutions. Mutations include mismatches, short duplications, long nontemplated insertions, large deletions and template switches to sister chromatids and nonallelic chromosomes. Drug-induced replication stress or the depletion of DNA repair factors Rad51, the COPS2 signalosome subunit or POLη change the pattern of template switching and alter the eccDNA mutagenic profiles. We propose an asynchronous capture model based on break-induced replication from microsatellite-induced DNA double strand breaks to account for the generation and circularization of mutagenized eccDNAs and the appearance of genomic homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scars. These results may help to explain the appearance of tumor eccDNAS and their roles in neoantigen production, oncogenesis and resistance to chemotherapy.

pmcIntroduction

DNA replication is continuously challenged by exogenous and endogenous replication stressors including DNA damage, tightly bound proteins, transcription complexes and non-B (noncanonical, non-Watson-Crick) DNA structures (1,2). The formation of non-B structures is a common feature of short (∼1–9 bp) tandemly repeated sequences termed microsatellites, which are highly abundant in metazoan genomes, representing approximately 3% of human DNA. The structural instability of microsatellites has been attributed to their tendency to form noncanonical structures, e.g. DNA hairpins, four-stranded G-quadruplex (G4) DNA, triple stranded Hoogstein DNA (H-DNA), and unwound or collapsed AT-rich DNA structures (3–8). Microsatellite instability has been causally linked to more than forty neurological and developmental disorders including Huntington's disease (HD), Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), and Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 10 (3,9–13). Short tandem repeats are also found at chromosome fragile sites where they are hotspots of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), mutagenesis and nonreciprocal template switches. Accordingly, triplex- and quadruplex-prone sequences co-localize with breakpoints in the human c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and in the BCL-2 gene in follicular lymphoma (10,14–19).

Hairpin, AT-rich, triplex and G4 DNA are susceptible to replication-dependent DSBs, hypermutagenesis and chromosomal template switches (20–30) by the homology-dependent mechanisms of break-induced replication (BIR) and BIR-like long-tract gene conversion (20–22). Repetitive elements and regions of chromosome instability are also enriched in eccDNAs (14,31,32). In addition to homologous recombination (HR), nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and mismatch repair (MMR) have been implicated in the production of eccDNA during breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles, circularization following chromothripsis, episome extrusion due to stalled replication, and through cycles of nonallelic template switches and excision (14,33–39), however, there is little mechanistic information regarding how specific microsatellites become configured into eccDNAs.

eccDNAs are double stranded, circular molecules, frequently with the ability to replicate autonomously (28,33,40–46). eccDNA is found in all eukaryotes, including human normal cells and tumors (31,40,45–49). Depending on their size or content eccDNAs can be classified as episomes or double minutes (DMs) (∼100 kb–3 Mb), small polydisperse circular DNA (spcDNA) (∼100 bp −10 kb), and microDNA (∼100–400 bp) (14,40,50–52). eccDNAs have been associated with the etiology of cancer, neurological disorders, autoimmunity, aberrant cell signaling and ageing due to gene rearrangement/amplification, altered transcriptional activity and enhanced chromatin accessibility (34,42,52–56). Extrachromosomal DNAs in microglia have recently been reported to lead to neurodegeneration (57), raising the possibility that replication-dependent microsatellite instability in microglia may contribute to the degeneration of post-mitotic neurons in HD, DM1 and SCA10.

We have analyzed the formation of eccDNA from four different microsatellites (G4, H-DNA, hairpin, and AT-rich DNA) at the single molecule level, integrated at the same ectopic chromosomal site. Using inverse PCR (iPCR) we find that each of these microsatellites produces eccDNAs containing unique template switching events which are recurrent, nonrandom, and distinct from those of the other microsatellites. The structures of the eccDNAs are dependent on DNA replication, and the eccDNA recombinants are mutagenized at ∼1000-fold the wild type rate. The microsatellite repeats themselves are hotspots for mutagenesis, including deletions, insertions, and base substitutions, with mutagenesis extending more than 5–10 kb bidirectionally from each microsatellite. Template switching events abundant in eccDNAs are strongly directed by distinct patterns of microhomology, and occur within the ectopic site and to nonallelic chromosomes.

Materials and methods

Cell culture

HeLa/406 acceptor cells containing a single FRT site were used for the construction of all cell lines used in this study (20–22,58,59). HeLa/406 cells were co-transfected using dual fluorescence (dTomato, eGFP) donor plasmids and the pOG44 expression vector that produces FLP recombinase (21,22). Clonal cell lines were derived by limiting dilution. Cells were maintained on DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 5% CO2 at 37°C. For replication stress experiments, cells were treated with hydroxyurea (HU, 0.2 mM, 4 days) or aphidicolin (APH, 0.2 uM, 2 days), after which the cells were returned to standard medium and cultured for an additional 4 days to allow the turnover of preexisting dTomato and eGFP proteins. In protein knockdown experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA (final concentration 50 nM) or shRNA (15 nM final concentration) once or twice over a 48 hr period, washed, and allowed to recover in fresh medium for 4 days.

Cell lines are named DF/myc for the dual fluorescence genes and the presence of the c-myc core origin, followed by the microsatellite of choice; DF/myc(G4), DF/myc(H3), DF/myc(CAG)102 and DF/myc(ATTCT)47. For simplicity the cell lines are referred to as G4, H3, (CAG)102, and (ATTCT)47, respectively. The sequences of the G4 and H3 microsatellites have been published (21). Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Accuri 6 flow cytometer. All flow experiments were calibrated against the same set of yellow (dTom+, eGFP+), green (dTom−, eGFP+), red (dTom+, eGFP−) and double negative (dTom−, eGFP−) stable marker cell lines. The ectopic microsatellite cells had undergone ∼150 (G4, H3) or ∼200 ((CAG)102, (ATTCT)47) generations from the time of transfection through limiting dilution, clonal outgrowth and flow cytometry/DNA isolation. The siRNA and shRNA sequences used for protein knockdown are shown in Supplementary Table S1.

Inverse PCR

DNA extraction was performed using Tissue DNA kits (Omega, D3396-00S). Inverse PCR (iPCR) was performed on undigested total genomic DNA using Q5 HotStart polymerase (New England Biolabs, M0494S). The primers used for amplification are shown in Supplementary Table S2. PCR Products were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels. The amplified products were purified (Omega, D6492-01) before PacBio Sequel IIe sequencing (Azenta, Plainfield, NJ).

DNA sequence analysis

To decatenate the iPCR products in the circular consensus reads, bespoke shell scripts were used to identify and mark the termini of individual PCR products within the concatemer strings, based on the primer sequences used for PCR. Individual PCR product sequence strings were then extracted for mapping. Hybrid reference genomes for each ectopic site or iPCR sequence were generated which included HeLa-based sequences for each chromosome in the human reference genome (GRCh38) (27). BWA was used to index the reference genomes and BWA-MEM (60) was used for mapping sequence reads against the hybrid reference sequences containing the engineered ectopic site, or the expected iPCR product. Sequence reads that did not contain ectopic site sequences for at least 6 bp 3′ to each iPCR primer were considered non-specific PCR products and were removed from the next round of mapping.

Duplicated sequences were also identified and removed. The second round of mapping was performed on unique reads which contained ectopic site sequences. Samtools (61) was used to sort and generate binary output for the mapped datasets (.bam and .bai files). Samtools was also used to generate statistics on the mapped datasets such as depth of coverage, contig length vs. number of reads, deletion events, deleted nucleotides, insertion events, inserted nucleotides, base mismatches, and pileup of the data. Pileup data was parsed using a bespoke shell script to summarize the total number of insertions, deletions and mismatches at a given position.

Additionally, the perl script pileup2baseindel.pl (https://github.com/riverlee/pileup2base) was used to generate detailed information on indel sequences. The sam2paf.js script from minimap2 (https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) (62) was used to convert .sam files to .paf format for use as input for analysis by ALVIS (63). A bespoke script was used to extract the mapped locations of fragments from chimeric reads and data were formatted for use with Circos (64). Integrative Genomics Viewer (65) was used to visualize and understand the composition of reads, links between mapped regions, and alignments against the genome. BLAST was used for base composition analysis. The .sam files were sorted and converted to .bam format which was also indexed for use with Ribbon (66). The number of reads in each Ribbon alignment is shown in the corresponding figure legend. Student's t-test for random microhomology length was performed against a random number array generated by Graphpad Prism (https://www.graphpad.com). Sequence alignments were also performed using SnapGene (https://www.snapgene.com) or NCBI BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). eccDNA diagrams were created with BioRender (https://www.BioRender.com/).

Results

Model systems of microsatellite instability

Microsatellites expanded beyond approximately 40–50 tandem repeats are unstable at their natural loci and at ectopic sites in mammalian genomes (22,26,67–73). We hypothesized that instability at microsatellites capable of forming quadruplex, triplex, hairpin or AT-structured DNAs could lead to the formation of eccDNAs. To test this hypothesis, we derived cell lines containing microsatellite DNAs integrated at an ectopic site (ES) in HeLa cells, where these microsatellites had been shown to display replication-dependent instability (20,21,26,59,67,74–76). The ES (76–78) is stable in the absence of the c-myc origin, in the presence of the c-myc origin without added non-B DNA, and in the presence of the c-myc origin in the presence of non-pathogenic length non-B DNA (21,22,30). The non-B DNA microsatellite cell lines were each generated by single copy integration at the same ectopic FLP recombinase site, alongside a copy of the 2.4 kb c-myc core replication origin (21,22,58,59) (Figure 1). The ES c-myc origin is active in > 90% of replications, and displays the chromatin structure, replication protein binding, and early S-phase replication timing pattern of the endogenous c-myc origin (22,30,59,67,79). Dual fluorescence (DF; dTomato (dTom) and eGFP) reporter genes were positioned within the ES to allow DSBs to be detected by flow cytometry based on the loss of reporter protein fluorescence. AluYa5/IVS sequences derived from the human UBE2T locus provided targets for homology-dependent recombination (80).

Microsatellite sequences (A) (CAG)102, (B) above; H3 (21) (triplex forming); below, predicted triplex conformation; (C) G4 (21) quadruplex forming) (21), (D) (ATTCT)47 (30) were integrated at the FLP recombinase target (FRT) site in HeLa/406 cells (78) (CAG)102, H3 and G4 were placed in the lagging template strand; (ATTCT)47 was placed in the upper (5′-3′) strand template of the 2.4 kb c-myc core origin (30,78). Alu/IVS sequences were derived from the UBE2T locus (80). Hyg, hygromycin resistance; Neo, neomycin resistance; TK, HSV thymidine kinase minigene (ΔTK); FRT, FLP recombinase target.

Each cell line is named for the non-B DNA in the lagging strand template when replicated from the c-myc origin. Triplex (H-DNA, H3) and quadruplex (G4) inserts were derived from the PKD1 IVS21 homopurine-homopyrimidine (Pu/Py) asymmetric mirror repeat (81). The H3 microsatellite (21) was designed to fulfill the requirements of homopurine-homopyrimidine mirror-symmetry (82,83) (Figure 1B).

The canonical G4 consensus sequence is (G)3(N)1–7(G)3(N)1–7(G)3(N)1–7(G)3, although consensus matches with loop regions as long as (N)30 have been reported to form stable G4 structures (84–86). The ectopic G4 microsatellite contained five matches to the canonical consensus in the lagging strand template of the c-myc origin (21).

The (CAG)102 insert length was chosen to exceed the threshold associated with the DM1 phenotype (87), and has been shown to adopt a hairpin structure in vitro and in vivo (59,67). The (ATTCT)47 microsatellite has been shown to restore replication initiation activity to the core c-myc origin inactivated by deletion of the DNA unwinding element (DUE), and to induce replication-dependent instability (30). The non-B DNA cell lines are referred to hereafter by their ES non-B DNA ((CAG)102, G4, H3 and (ATTCT)47).

Each clonal cell line was derived by limiting dilution. Upon clonal outgrowth, mixed flow cytometry profiles (dTom+, eGFP+; dTom+, eGFP−; dTom−, eGFP+; dTom−, eGFP−) were displayed by (CAG)102, G4, H3 and (ATTCT)47 cells (Figure 2), indicating that the same, or different, microsatellite sequences can undergo dissimilar forms of mutagenesis (88,89).

Ectopic microsatellites generate distinct patterns of mutation

After prolonged culture (150–200 generations) the ectopic non-B microsatellite clones showed instability when analyzed by flow cytometry. (CAG)102 clone 10 (c.10) cells contained two yellow cell populations (dTom+, eGFP+; upper right (UR) quadrant) differing in the intensity of eGFP fluorescence, whereas more than 50% of the (CAG)102 clone 13 (c.13) cells lost expression of the dTom marker upstream of the (CAG)102 microsatellite. Both CAG clones displayed a nominal population (∼12%) of double negative cells which had lost expression of both color marker genes, however, neither of the CAG clones showed appreciable red (dTom+, eGFP−) cell populations.

In the two G4 clones, G4 clone #1 (G4 c.1), had lost half of the G4 insert and G4 clone #6 (G4 c.6) had lost the entire quadruplex consensus sequence (21). Despite having undergone a partial microsatellite deletion, G4 c.1 retained both fluorescent reporter genes and appeared in the upper right (Figure 2D; UR, yellow) flow cytometry quadrant, while most G4 c.6 cells (Figure 2E) had lost or mutated the dTom marker and appeared in the LR green quadrant. However, neither G4 clone exhibited red or double negative cells.

The H3 cells retained the triplex DNA insert during clonal outgrowth (21) but showed modest instability after long term culture, indicated by the appearance of green cells (dTom−, eGFP+; LR quadrant), and double negative (dTom−, eGFP−) cells (Figure 2(F)). In contrast to the G4 or (CAG)102 cells, the H3 cells generated only a small percentage (∼1%) of red cells, even after prolonged culture.

The flow cytometry pattern of the (ATTCT)47 cells (Figure 2G) was substantially different from those of the other five cell clones. Two populations of yellow cells were evident, differing in the intensity of the dTom signal. We speculate that, as in (CAG)102 c.10 cells, the more highly fluorescent (ATTCT)47 cells contain extrachromosomal copies of the ES (but with mutations in the dTom reporter). Similarly, we propose that the less highly fluorescent (CAG)102 c.10 population contains extrachromosomal copies of the ES with mutations in the eGFP reporter. Both populations of yellow (ATTCT)47 cells also generated red cell populations (UL quadrant) consistent with loss of eGFP expression by local mutation or recombination, and double negative cells (LL quadrant) indicating the loss of expression of both reporter genes in the same cell.

All of the flow cytometry profiles shown here were derived from cells under unperturbed growth conditions, indicating that microsatellite instability occurs in the presence of endogenous replication stress. The consistent absence of green cells from the (ATTCT)47 population, or of red cells from the CAG, H3 or G4 cell populations, lead to the conclusion that different non-B DNAs induce distinct patterns of mutagenesis in the flanking DNA. Moreover, differences between sister (CAG)102 clones or sister G4 clones, and the mixture of mutants with a clonal population, reveal that divergent patterns of mutagenesis arise from a single non-B DNA.

Microsatellites generate eccDNAs

To test the hypothesis that microsatellite DNA replication could generate eccDNAs we used inverse PCR (iPCR) on undigested total genomic DNA from the ectopic microsatellite cell lines (20,90–92). iPCR primers were designed that face away from each other at the ES, to amplify only circular templates. The iPCR products ranged from ∼250 bp to ∼15 kb (Figure 3). The maximum size of the observed iPCR products may reflect a limitation on the extent of the iPCR by the Q5 DNA polymerase. We note as well that these products do not reveal the length of the DNA between the 5′ ends of the iPCR primers.

Figure 3. eccDNA iPCR. Total genomic DNA was isolated from the ES microsatellite cell clones and amplified by inverse PCR to visualize eccDNAs. Lane 1, no template control (NTC) reaction; lane 2, G4 clone 1 DNA; lane 3, NTC; lane 4, H3 DNA; lane 5, NTC; lane 6, G4 clone 6 DNA; lane 7, NTC; lane 8, (ATTCT)47 DNA; lane 9, NTC; lane 10, (CAG)102 clone 10 DNA; lane 11, NTC; lane 12, (CAG)102 clone 13 DNA; lane 13, NTC; lane 14, HeLa/406 DF/myc DNA (control, no microsatellite insert).

Each of the microsatellite-containing ES’s generated distinct iPCR products; in contrast, the empty ES which contains the active c-myc origin core but no additional non-B DNA, did not produce clear iPCR products (Figure 3, lane 14). We conclude that each microsatellite represents a hotspot for eccDNA formation, and generates multiple preferred, distinct recombinants.

Complex rearrangements in eccDNAs

The iPCR products from each microsatellite ES were analyzed by long read Hi-Fi circular consensus DNA sequencing (93,94). During the processing of the raw sequencing data, reads were deduplicated to eliminate sequence overrepresentation due to PCR amplification. Deduplication also eliminates all but one WT read, and any identical recombinants or mutants, i.e. all of the analyzed reads are unique. The iPCR strategy only visualizes eccDNA circles that contain both primer binding sites, thus all reads contain domains that include the forward and reverse iPCR primer binding sites.

The iPCR product sequences from the ectopic microsatellite cell lines were mapped by Ribbon (66), a tool which uses BWA-MEM alignment (60) against the ES sequence and the human reference genome (GRCh38 merged with the HeLa genome (27)) for the analysis of complex genome rearrangements. The assignments in Ribbon were confirmed by the alignment of individual reads to the hybrid reference genome using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

In contrast to genome browsers which are valuable for representing short-read alignments, long-read sequencing can show more complex patterns of structural variation that are hard to represent by mapping different parts of the read to a reference. The advantages of Ribbon are apparent with long sequence reads, to show patterns in the alignments of many reads. The Reference Viewport perspectives in Ribbon (Figure 4) give a broad picture of template switching within the ES and to nonallelic chromosomal sites in multiple reads. The Reference Viewport alignments stack individual reads from top to bottom by decreasing stringency scores to plot the location of read sequences at the ES (left side of each panel) or to donor nonallelic chromosomes (right side). The Query Viewport perspective (Supplementary Figure S4) allows detailed inspection of individual reads. Together, long reads from PacBio sequencing show complex rearrangements in the ectopic sites as well as interchromosomal template switching.

Figure 4. Template switching in eccDNAs. The sequences of the eccDNA were aligned using the Ribbon (66) Reference Viewport. Individual reads are represented by horizontal lines (blue or red). Blue, plus strand reads; red, minus strand reads. eccDNA diagrams were created with BioRender.com. As an example, 26 466 reads (numbered in Figure 4A) are aligned above a map of the ectopic site (ES). Blue or red sequences are template switching domains present in the eccDNAs (e.g. Figure 4A, (a)–(e)); pink areas between the template switching domains are ES sequences that were deleted from the eccDNAs during template switching. For each panel the top bar contains a color-coded index of chromosomes. The ES region is located in the leftmost lower panel; nonallelic template switches are indicated in the righthand panels with slanted lines referring back to nonallelic template switching target chromosomes. Lines 1–5 in panels (A)–(E) are reads selected for later reference in the text. The template switching domains are labeled independently in each panel. (A) (CAG)102 c.10 eccDNA (n = 26 466 reads); (B) (CAG)102 c.13 eccDNA (n = 249 reads). (C) G4, c.1 eccDNA (n = 485 reads); (D) G4 c.6 eccDNA (n = 1695 reads). (E) H3 eccDNA (n = 1197 reads); (F) (ATTCT)47 eccDNA (n = 1299 reads). Cells were treated with siCON (Materials and methods). Below the alignments, arrows above the ES map indicate the approximate positions of the iPCR primers. The thickened endpoints of the brackets above the ES map indicate FRT/FRT, Alu/Alu or other eccDNA circularization junctions.

Scanning across individual reads from any of the microsatellite cell lines (Figure 4), the most immediate observation is that large swathes of the ES are missing from the eccDNAs. Thus, eccDNAs reflect template switching events within the ES and to nonallelic sites, which delete large regions of the ES. We term those regions that are noncontiguous in the ES but are contiguous in the reads ‘template switching domains’. For example, line 1 (read #25 187) in (CAG)102 c.10 cells (Figure 4A), shows five prominent template switching domains (a)–(e) within the ES that appear in the eccDNAs.

It is notable that deletions due to template switching occur both upstream and downstream of the ectopic microsatellites and DSBs at the (CTG/CAG) and G4 non-B DNAs (22,79). In yeast, the replication of GAA and ATTCT repeats has also been shown to lead to DNA DSBs (95,96). These results likely exclude replication models of eccDNA formation not involving DSBs, such as episome extrusion, which do not include template switching between DNA nascent strands, or between nascent and template strands of a replication fork.

The reads from each clone could be organized into a complex phylogenetic tree (not shown), in which the branches or clades reflect the recurrent patterns of template switching domains within each clone. Reads were selected (lines 1–5 in each clone) which are representative of branches within the cladogram. Thus, the same extended sequence (most often the 311 bp Alu or the 48 bp FRT) is present at the downstream end of the domain(s) read by the forward primer and the upstream end of the domain(s) read by the reverse primer in nearly all of the eccDNAs (Figure 4A-F). In (CAG)102 c.10 eccDNA reads at and above line 4 (read #7990), the forward primer extension products (domain (d)) terminate at the downstream FRT sequence and recombine to form an eccDNA circularization junction with the upstream FRT sequence at the 5′ end of domain (a). Similarly, in reads #1 000–7 500, the 3′ end of domain (d) terminates at the downstream Alu d(T)29 repeat, and recombines to form eccDNA circularization junctions with domain (c) products that terminate in the second Alu repeat, or domain (b) products ending at the first Alu repeat. These common ‘eccDNA circularization junction’ sequences suggest that homology directed repair is responsible for circularization of the eccDNAs.

(CAG)102 repeats are hotspots for template switching or mutagenesis. Virtually all of the (CAG)102 c.10 reads at or above line 4 (Figure 4A, read #8000–26 466) show template switches within the CAG repeats. Multiple reads below #1500 in the (CAG)102 c.10 eccDNA alignment show template switches to nonallelic chromosomes indicated in red, indicating that these sequences were copied in the q (long arm) → p (short arm) direction.

In G4 c.1 cell reads at or above line 2, domain (a) becomes ligated to domain (b) at microhomologies between G4 consensus sites in the dTom and eGFP genes, deleting the entire c-myc region. Between lines 2 and 4 the c-myc origin is retained, but ∼250–260 bp extending from the intrinsic c-myc quadruplex forming sequences (Pu)27 (97) to the center of the G4 microsatellite insert is deleted in 100% of reads. In G4 c.6 cells and H3 cell reads above line 3 (Figure 4C), the circularization junction between domains (a) and (c) occurs through the 48 bp FRT homology. In contrast, in G4 c.6 cells the ES template switches to nonallelic sites on chromosomes 2, 7, 8 and 16 occur through regions of Alu homology.

In (ATTCT)47 cells, the nascent DNA strand reverses polarity to copy itself, or the parental strand of the sister template, beginning at a 6 bp microhomology in domain (b) (red reads) (Figure 4F). In the reads below line 3 the nascent strand also copied domain (b), but in the forward polarity. Reads below line 3 show similar (±2 bp) internal template switching overlaps, and all show the same 8 bp eccDNA circularization junction, located in the c-myc (Pu)27 (97) G4 consensus sequences. Several reads below line 3 also show 3′ extensions of domain (c) ending between eGFP and TK; all of these reads terminate within 24 bp of multiple G4 consensus sequence matches. Taken together, these results suggest that quadruplex forming sequences are sites of heightened instability during eccDNAs formation.

The alignment pattern of (ATTCT)47 cells using iPCR primers flanking the ectopic microsatellite did not contain eccDNA sequences derived from the dTom gene (Figure 4F). However, when tested with iPCR primers flanking the dTom gene additional eccDNAs were revealed which contained dTom sequences (Supplementary Figure 1). Figure 4 also shows distinct eccDNAs that share only the iPCR primer domains. Taken together, these results indicate that distinct eccDNAs can be released from multiple regions of the same ectopic microsatellite site.

Patterns of template switching

The Query Viewport perspective in Ribbon shows the arrangements of the template switching domains of individual eccDNA reads. A schematic diagram (Figure 5) shows the structure of the (CAG)102 c.10 line 1 read, the corresponding eccDNA, and the eccDNA FRT junction homology between domains (a) and (d). Additional schematics of lines 1–5 for each clone are shown in Supplementary Figures 4A–F, where panels (I) show Query Viewport views of template switching in individual reads, panels (II) show box diagrams of ES domain switching, and panels (III) show the relative structures of the corresponding eccDNAs.

Overall, distinct mutagenesis patterns of template switching, indel frequency and indel size in (CAG)102, H3 and G4 microsatellites are evident in the Query Viewport views (Supplementary Figure 4). These plots show that both ES sequences and nonallelic template switch domains display hypermutagenesis (here, indels denoted by heavier red lines), and that reads containing the same template switching domains display distinct patterns of indels.

Clone (CAG)102 c.10 line 1, 2 and 3 reads encompass domains (a), (b), (c) [the reverse primer domain] and (d) [the forward primer domain], but show different patterns of indels (Supplementary Figure 4A). Reads below line 3 show similar (±2 bp) internal template switching sites, but large differences in indels (+/- 200 bp).

Multiple G4 c.1 domain (b) reads show identical template switch sites but different sets of indels. For example, G4 c.1 line 3 and 4 reads across domains (b) and (c) have the same template switch junctions but substantially different mutational patterns. Similarly, G4 c.6 reads show identical template switch sites with different sets of mutations. In contrast, G4 c.1 line 2, 3, and 5 reads contain different nonallelic template switches, and G4 c.6 cells show distinct nonallelic template switches to chromosome 8 (lines 3 and 4) in the p → q direction and in the q → p direction, respectively (Supplementary Figure 4C, D).

In the H3 line 4 read, the domain (b) and (e) sequences are criss-crossed (minus strand reads; Supplementary Figure 4E (I)), indicating that the replicative polymerase had reversed direction and switched templates to copy the upstream (self) nascent DNA, or the sister chromatid parental DNA.

Insertions that are not found in the human, bacterial or viral NCBI GenBank databases are present at apparent gaps in the sequences of (CAG)102 line 1 read, H3 cell lines 3 and 4 reads, and clone (ATTCT)47 line 3 read (Supplementary Figure 4). These segments may be due to mutagenic misalignment insertions by the TLS POLq (98–102), which has been implicated in off-target integration events during DSB repair (102–104).

In (ATTCT)47 cells, the nascent strand reversed polarity to copy itself or the parental strand sequences of the sister chromatid in the reads of domain (a) (Figure 4C, red; Supplementary Figure 4F (I)). The line 1 and line 2 reads show similar template switching domains, however, as shown below, these reads differ dramatically from one another in the extent and nonoverlapping patterns of mutagenesis, and in distinct template switch boundaries, suggesting that these rearrangements occurred in independent progenitors, rather than as successive events in a single lineage.

Taken together, the Query Viewpoint patterns show that (a) indel mutagenesis occurs upstream and downstream of each microsatellite, in both ES and nonallelic sequences, (b) multiple indel mutations are often observed at local hotspots, and (c) reads with similar template switches display distinct patterns of mutagenesis over the same DNA sequences.

Nonallelic template switches

Nonallelic chromosomal template switches were mapped based on BWA-MEM alignment using Circos (64), and are shown by lines connecting the ES to nonhomologous donor chromosomes (Supplementary Figure 3). Each of the microsatellite cell lines, except for G4 c.1, showed nonallelic chromosomal template switches.

Chromosome 8 was a target for template switching in several of the cell lines. Since chromosome 8 harbors the c-myc gene, and the 5′ portion of that gene is part of the ES, we wished to confirm that the template switches are not BWA-MEM misalignments. BLAST sequence analysis showed that 34 of 357 reads from (CAG)102 c.10, 2 of 3 reads from (CAG)102 c.13, all 159 of the reads from G4 c.6, and 12 of 17 reads from H3 cells contain sequences on chromosome 8 that do not appear at the ES. Similarly, the PGK promoter from chromosome X (chromosome 23) is used as a promoter for the dTom gene; (CAG)102 c.10 shows two template switches to chromosome 23, neither of which is at the PGK locus.

At the resolution of these Circos plots, apparently identical breakpoint junctions may be many kilobases apart on the nonallelic chromosome. Thus, (CAG)102 c.13 template switches to chromosome 8 are separated by ∼49 kb, while G4 c.6 exhibits 13 template switches to the long arm of chromosome 8 that are ∼480 kb apart. This analysis reinforces the view that template switching during the formation of eccDNAs leads to recombination between sequences within the ES and to nonallelic chromosomes.

Hypermutation of eccDNA

The rates of eccDNA mutagenesis (indels, substitutions) within the template switching domains of each ES non-B DNA cell clone are quantitated in Table 1. The range of total mutation frequency was relatively narrow, from 3.85 × 10−5/bp/generation (H3 cells) to 1.04 × 10−4/bp/generation ((CAG)102 c.10 cells). These likely represent lower estimates of mutation frequencies, since mutation rates may decrease if the non-B DNA is deleted early in clonal outgrowth. Nevertheless, we posit that the narrow range of mutation frequencies likely reflect the occurrence of the same type of repair (BIR) in most cases, rather than different error rates being directed by different non-B DNA fork stalling events.

Recent analyses of long read synthesis-based sequencing have reported that polymerase pausing at potential non-B DNAs (direct/inverted/mirror repeats, G4 motifs, A-phased repeats) can decrease or increase the apparent mutation rate in PacBio raw sequence reads by –1.23-fold (G4 motif complement) to +1.79 fold (G4 motif) in the non-B DNA sequences relative to non-motif regions (frequency ∼0.2 mutations/kb) (105). These effects are reduced ∼3-fold by circular consensus sequencing (ccs) (105–108), as in this work.

To test whether this issue affected our conclusions, we confirmed the error frequency of PacBio ccs sequencing in the same ES DNA (non-microsatellite) of four plasmids used to construct non-B DNA clones (<0.2 errors/kb). It has also been suggested that slow-down of the replicative polymerases in vivo at the same structures as sequencing polymerases in vitro contribute to in vivo mutagenesis (105). To assess the possible contribution of errors during sequencing, we compared the range of mutation rates of the clones tested here after removing reads below a threshold of 2 mutations/kb from consideration. The high mutation threshold resulted in a range of mutation rates of 1.1 × 10−2 mutations/kb/generation [in (ATTCT)47 cells] to 1.8 × 10−2 mutations/kb/generation [in (CAG)102 c.13 cells] compared to the range of rates without applying a mutation threshold of 1.1 × 10−2 mutations/kb/generation [in (CAG)102 c.13 cells] – 1.4 × 10−2 mutations/kb/generation [in G4 c.1 cells]. The high mutation threshold did not appreciably change the appearance of the alignments of the (CAG)102 clones (Supplementary Figure 3), the G4, H3, or (ATTCT)47 cell lines (not shown), or the mechanistic conclusions of this work. Therefore, no threshold or adjustment was applied to the data.

To obtain higher resolution views of the patterns of eccDNA mutagenesis the reverse primer domain from randomly sampled reads in each ES clone were aligned (Supplementary Figure 5). Here, the reads that span the c-myc origin (Figure 4A, reads #1100–5800) consistently delete or mutate the CAG triplets (Supplementary Figure 5A). Overall, greater than ninety percent of the H3, G4 or (CAG)102 microsatellites were found to have been mutagenized within or immediately flanking the non-B DNAs. (The iPCR primers chosen for the (ATTCT)47 cell line did not report on the microsatellite sequence). As well, in all ES microsatellite clones, we also consistently observe deletion of the GC rich (Pu)27 sequence (97). These results suggest that the BIR replisome bypasses G4 structures instead of replicating through them.

All H3 reads are mutagenized at the triplex forming sequence; mutations are base substitutions, internal indels, and insertions at the 3′ microsatellite boundary. In contrast, the quadruplex-forming sequences are deleted completely in G4 c.1 and c.6 cells, while (CAG)102 clones show primarily short (5–150 bp) deletions within the microsatellite, or insertion of incomplete CAG repeats at 3′ edge of the microsatellite.

In H3 cells, the line 3 read crosses the H3 microsatellite but mutates 28 bp of 60 bp of the H3 microsatellite sequence, while the 5′ ends of domain (b) between the line 3 and 4 reads begin ∼200 bp downstream from the H3 microsatellite. In these cells, the line 1 read is the longest (>10 kb) read analyzed and exhibits a high mutation frequency despite the read not covering the microsatellite domain, consistent with mutagenesis at distances greater than five kilobases from the ES.

The mutations in different eccDNAs could arise independently or progressively in a cell lineage as a chromosomal ES accumulates successive changes. Given the likelihood of autonomous eccDNA replication (109,110), different mutational patterns might also arise consecutively in an eccDNA lineage. Therefore, consistent deletions at a specific site across multiple reads could reflect independent mutations at a hotspot, or a parental mutation followed by flanking mutations in subsequent replications. However, if the microsatellite is responsible for initiating mutagenesis, then deletion of the non-B DNA sequence would be a terminal event.

Examination of the reverse primer domain alignments also shows that the endpoints of the same template switching domain can vary by more than 100 bp within a cell clone. As shown below, analysis of the template switching junctions shows that they are dominated by sequence homology overlaps in all of the cell lines.

Microhomology-dependent template switching

Short sequence homologies are often found to overlap breakpoint junctions repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), ALT-NHEJ (microhomology-mediated end joining, MMEJ), ‘fork stalling and template switching’ (FoSTeS) and MMBIR (111–119). Short sequence homologies also occur alongside break-point junctions without frankly overlapping the junctions (120–123), in agreement with the notion that sequences upstream of a strand break affect the choice of template switching junctions.

An overview of template switching overlap homologies in the ES microsatellite clones was generated by ALVIS (63), a tool for the visualization of contig overlaps (Supplementary Figure 6). This analysis shows that virtually all of the template switch junctions displayed up to ∼300 bp of overlap homology.

In (CAG)102 c.10 cells the template switching domains show overlaps of up to 48 bp. The base position of the overlaps varies between reads, although several reads show similar overlap patterns in addition to common domain boundaries. Consistent with the contribution of Alu elements to genomic plasticity (29,124–126), a distinct hotspot for template switching from the second to the third Alu element of the ES is found within the Alu d(T)29 tail. The same sequence is a preferred site for ES and nonallelic template switching in (CAG)102 c.13 cells where overlap homologies as long as 121 bp are observed. In (CAG)102 c.10 and c.13 cells, template switching within the Alu d(T)29 sequence consistently resulted in the deletion of 2–4 d(T) nucleotides.

Clones containing the G quadruplex-forming consensus sequence, G4 c.1 and G4 c.6 also show frequent recombination at the d(T)29 sequence, however, the overlap between Alu sites is markedly shorter in the ES recombinants than in the template switches between chromosomes. A pattern of 6 bp overlap in ES template switches between Alu elements is seen in G4 c.1 and G4 c.6 reads, whereas nonallelic template jumps, particularly to chromosome 8, displayed 43–101 bp overlaps. Thus, different mechanisms may be involved in intrachromosomal vs. nonallelic template switching, potentially reflecting disparate roles of Rad51 in these processes (54,127).

The G4 c.1 and G4 c.6 reads also show several insertions of nonrepetitive, nontemplated insertions of 30–60 bp, consistent with the proposed activity of DNA polymerase θ in MMBIR and theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) (99,100,123). We note also that the chromosome 8 template switches recurrently target Alu sequences 27 kb upstream of the c-myc locus. Supplementary Figure 6 also shows several reads from G4 c.6 with template switches flanking, but not overlapping, an Alu repeat. This is in line with the idea that homeologous sequences upstream of the invading 3′ end are involved in discriminating between multiple potential homologous sites for invasion (119,121).

Template switches in H3 cells also frequently occur with 6 bp overlaps at the beginning of the Alu d(T)29 sequence, however, a fraction of recurrent template switches to chromosome 8 do not occur within Alu repeats, and do not target the c-myc locus, but show template jumps 1.5 Mb upstream of c-myc. The differences in the patterns of nonallelic template switches in the G4 versus H3 clones suggest that these non-B DNAs may differ in the way they remodel the stalled replication fork (128). Consistent with this suggestion, (ATTCT)47 cell reads rarely show template switches within Alu repeats, and those reads that show Alu recombination do not recombine within the d(T)29 Alu sequence. The strong tendency for overlap homology during template switching is confirmed in nucleotide resolution views of template switch overlaps in lines (1–5) from each ES microsatellite clone (Supplementary Figure 7).

We also wished to investigate whether there is regularity or randomness to the pattern of microhomology selection. As shown in Figure 6, there is a clear preference for 10 bp overlaps in G4 c.1 cells, but a dominance of 1, 2, 6 and 8 bp overlaps in G4 c.6 cells, and overlaps of 2 and 5 bp in clone H3. Clone (ATTCT)47 reads show a majority of 2, 4, 6 and 22 bp overlaps. In contrast, reads from clone (CAG)102 c.13 show a preponderance of 14 bp overlaps, while clone (CAG)102 c.10 shows overlaps of 1, 2, 8, 9, 13, 16 and 42 bp. When challenged against a random number array, each of these distributions is highly nonrandom. We suggest that sequences preceding the 3′ end contribute to the selection against multiple potential microhomology targets. Moreover, the nonrandom pattern of overlap homology may reflect the stable recruitment of distinct DNA damage tolerance polymerases to the BIR replisome at specific non-B DNAs.

Y-axis, overlap base pairs; X-axis, overlap event number. Note that a read with several template switches will have multiple overlap events. Each of these distributions is nonrandom and distinct from one another (P< 10−30, pairwise Student's t-tests).

Single molecule analysis of mutations

The approximate location of mutations in lines 1–5 of Figure 4 were mapped in BLAST by alignment to the ES or to the reference GRCh38/HeLa genome, (Supplementary Figure 8).

We previously mapped a MUS81-dependent DSB immediately 3′ to the ectopic (CTG)102 microsatellite and showed that hypermutagenesis occurred 5′ and 3′ from that DSB (22). The spread of mutagenesis upstream and downstream from the hairpins in (CAG)102 c.10 cells and (CAG)102 c.13 cells (59) shows further evidence of replication-dependent mutagenesis, consistent with a BIR-like repair mechanism extending bidirectionally from a double-ended DSB. One of the longest reads (Supplementary Figure 8C; H3, line 1) shows that hypermutagenesis extends more than 10 kb upstream from the H3 microsatellite repeat. Additionally, reads covering the same region of the ES (e.g. H3 cells, lines 2, 2B, 3, 3B; (ATTCT)47 cells, lines 1, 1B, 2, 2B) show dramatically different frequencies and positions of mutations, suggesting that the activity of the repair replisome over the same template sequence differs between repair events (21).

We also analyzed the mismatch mutational signatures of the eccDNAs in the absence of external replication stress, and of the (CAG)102 and (ATTCT)47 clones in the presence of drug- or protein knockdown-induced replication stress (Supplementary Figure 8G). Each bar represents the sum of the substitutions for the central base of the sixteen possible trinucleotides. The high levels of C/G > T/A mutations seen in H3, G4 and ATTCT clones are characteristic of APOBEC cytidine deamination, while the elevated T/A > G/C single base substitution mutations seen in (CAG)102 clones are characteristic of POLη mutagenesis (129). Overall, the signatures do not identify the mutation signature of any single TLS polymerase but resemble COSMIC (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/tool/cosmic/) Signature 3 (123), ascribed to homologous recombination repair deficiency (123).

Replication stress-dependent changes in eccDNA

Based on previous results showing that replication stress enhanced microsatellite instability (59), we tested whether low doses of the deoxyribonucleotide synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU, 0.2 mM) or the replicative polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin (APH, 0.2 uM) would alter the structure of eccDNAs.

Treatment of (CAG)102 c.10 cells with HU resulted in the dramatic decrease of template switching, including the loss of template switching domains (a) (b) and (e), the extension of the forward primer reads through the TK gene, and the loss of reads that extended from the c-myc origin to nonallelic chromosomal sites (Figure 7). Treatment of (CAG)102 c.10 cells with APH resulted in the loss of reversed (red) reads in domain (b), and an elongation of the forward primer reads through the TK gene into the chromosomal DNA flanking the ES.

Figure 7. Effects of replication stress on eccDNA structure. Alignment of iPCR reads from (CAG)102 c.10 cells treated with (A) hydroxyurea (n = 18 reads) or (B) aphidicolin (n = 2439 reads).

These replication inhibitors also changed the eccDNA template switching patterns of (CAG)102 c.13 cells (Supplementary Figure 9) where HU treatment severely limited eccDNA to the region around the iPCR primers, while APH treatment resulted in the loss of reads containing domain (b) and reduced nonallelic recombination. In addition, treatment with HU or APH, changed the base substitution signatures of both (CAG)102 clones, consistent with the recruitment of alternative error-prone polymerases to stalled forks under replication stress (Supplementary Figure 8G). The Query Viewport patterns for individual read lines 1–5 of (CAG)102 cells treated with HU or APH are shown in Supplementary Figures 9C-F.

The increased instability of the (CAG)102 microsatellite ES’s by drug treatment is consistent with the induction of replication stress (7,29,130–133) and the effects of HU and APH on expanded CTG microsatellites (22). We conclude that perturbation of replication alters the patterns of template switching in eccDNAs, likely due to remodeling of stalled replication forks. We note as well that HU and APH each have different effects on eccDNA structure, indicating that alternative forms of replication stress have different consequences for microsatellite instability (88,89), possibly due to the alternative folding of stalled forks.

In addition, it is salient that HU or APH were administered only for 48–96 h before DNA isolation, thus the changes in eccDNA structure that were induced in (CAG)102 cells by these treatments are recent compared to the structures that accumulated during outgrowth of the clonal cell lines. Therefore, replication-dependent eccDNA mutagenesis is ongoing in these cell lines.

Rad51 affects eccDNA template switching

Rad51-dependent and -independent forms of BIR have been described in S. cerevisiae (134–137). To test whether Rad51 plays a role in the homology search leading to nonallelic template switching or in the reversal of stalled forks (54,108,138–144) during eccDNA synthesis, we knocked down Rad51 in (CAG)102 c.10 and (CAG)102 c.13 cells with shRNA (Figure 8). Rad51 depletion resulted in dramatic changes in the pattern of reads in (CAG)102 c.10 cells (decreased domain (a) and (b) reads, loss of reversed reads in domain (b)) and in (CAG)102 c.13 cells (decreased domain (a) and (b) reads, increase of domain (c) read length).

Comparing the lengths of template switch overlaps in control vs. Rad51 depleted (CAG)102 cells (Figure 9), we observe modestly decreased overlap lengths for sister chromatid (or self) template switches in (CAG)102 c.10 and c.13 cells. Although the number of reads with nonallelic switches was small in (CAG)102 c.13 cells, (CAG)102 c.10 cells knocked down for Rad51 showed strong decreases in overlap homology for nonallelic template switches. In addition, depletion of Rad51 changed the base substitution signatures of both (CAG)102 clones (Supplementary Figure 8G). These results are in agreement with evidence for multiple roles of Rad51 in fork reversal (54,108,141,143–145) and recombination (146–148), however, our data suggest a greater effect of Rad51 on nonallelic homology searches during BIR than during template switching within the ES.

Multiple effects of COPS2 and TLS on eccDNA structure

We recently reported the results of an shRNA screen for suppressors of BIR mutagenesis which identified the COPS2 subunit of the COP9 signalosome (20). COP9 inactivates the CUL4A/B ubiquitin ligase that targets PCNA (149), and thereby inhibits TLS polymerase POLη binding and TLS polymerase switching (150–155). Here, knockdown of COPS2 resulted in a decrease of eccDNA reads from an equivalent amount of total genomic DNA (Figure 10), and caused substantial changes in the structure of eccDNAs. In (CAG)102 c.10 cells COPS2 knockdown caused decreased nonallelic template switches, loss of template switching (reverse reads) in domain (b), the appearance of an additional template switch within domain (a), and deletion of ∼45 CAG repeats. In (CAG)102 c.13 cells COPS2 depletion led to a loss of domain (a) reads, increases of domain (d) reads, and shortening of domain (b) reads.

(D) (CAG)102 clone 13 cells, (E) (CAG)102 clone 13 cells depleted of COPS2. (F) Western blot, (CAG)102 clone 13 cells.

TLS polymerases have been implicated in microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR) in yeast (116), and we have reported that knockdown of Rad18, POLη or POL κ increases instability at an ectopic (CTG)100 microsatellite (22). Since COP9 is an upstream regulator of TLS polymerase recruitment, we examined whether the effects of COPS2 depletion on eccDNA structure could be recapitulated by knockdown of the POLη TLS polymerase. Surprisingly, POLη depletion had little effect on template switching in (CAG)102 c.13 cells (Figure 11A, B, E). However, examination of the (CAG)102 repeat showed that POLη knockdown increased the breadth of the CAG microsatellite deletion (Figure 11C, D).

Alignments are phased based on partial deletions within the CAG repeats. (E) Western blot (CAG)102 clone 13 cells. (F) Depletion of POLη increased the breadth of short deletions from 6.7 to 8.4 deleted bases/kb, P< 0.04) at the ectopic site, but slightly decreased the overall number of deletion events at the ectopic site from 1.66 to 1.62 deletion events/kb (P< 0.028 (not shown)). P values, Student's t-test.

The effect of POLη depletion was not limited to the (CAG)102 microsatellite. Quantified over the entire ES, Polη knockdown increased the maximal size of deletions, and increased the breadth of deletions from 6.7 to 8.4 deleted bases/kb, but slightly decreased the number of deletion events from 1.66 to 1.62 deletion events/kb (Figure 11F). We conclude that the loss of TLS POLη activity, or depletion of COPS2, destabilizes replication of the (CAG)102 microsatellite, but that the gross genomic effects of COPS2 knockdown are not entirely accounted for by POLη depletion. In addition, depletion of COPS2 or POLη changed the base substitution signatures of both (CAG)102 clones (Supplementary Figure 8G).

We note as well that the cell populations seen after knockdowns or drug treatment began as sister aliquots of a mixed population. Thus, a change in the appearance of the majority of the population after transient knockdown is not due to a clonally propagated stochastic change.

Discussion

Extrachromosomal DNAs are found in all species of eucaryotic cells, in a wide range of sizes and compositions. We have used microsatellites capable of forming hairpin, quadruplex, triplex and unwound DNAs to show that unstable microsatellite sequences are centers for the formation of eccDNAs in human chromosomes. The eccDNAs that we have characterized appear to be in the range of ∼250 bp – 15 kb, however, because we used head-to-head primers for iPCR, we do not formally know the length or sequence of the DNA that might be between the apposed 5′ ends of the iPCR primers. Nevertheless, close inspection of several Ribbon alignments (Figures 4, 7, 8) shows a small number of reads that span the 5′ ends of the primers, which we attribute to rolling circle replication during iPCR. As expected, these reads contain the ES sequences between the 5′ ends of the primers.

The conclusions from our earlier studies using standard PCR over the same ectopic sites as in the present work (22,26,30,156) are consistent with the current data on mutagenesis quantitation, template switching, and asynchronous capture. We also note that ectopic site plasmid DNA devoid of added non-B DNA, amplified by the proofreading Q5 polymerase and spiked into the NGS sample, did not show template switching or elevated mutation rates. As well, it is worthwhile to note that the template switches within the progeny of a cell clone are reproduced during the amplification of hundreds of distinct eccDNA molecules, and this reproducibility is evident in portions of the ectopic site that are kilobases from the non-B DNA. Further attesting to the fidelity of the Q5 polymerase iPCR, the template switching amplification pattern, though reproducible within each cell clone, is distinct between sister clones or between different non-sister non-B DNA clones.

Significantly, experimental changes in vivo (e.g. HU, APH, Rad51 and COPS2 knockdown) alter the template switching profiles and mutagenesis of the same ectopic site sequences in different cell clones. As an additional example, POLη knockdown has little overall effect on template switching, but increases the size of deletions at the non-B microsatellite DNA and over the entire ectopic site. Thus template switching and mutagenesis are not artifacts of the iPCR, but reflect altered polymerase activity in vivo.

Our data show that the instability of microsatellite non-B DNAs promotes the synthesis of highly mutagenized eccDNAs, and that exposure to replication stress changes the mutagenesis and template switching patterns over the eccDNAs. By comparison to ensemble analyses of DNA damage in response to replication stress, we show that a single form of stress can have different effects on the structure and mutagenic signatures of different microsatellites, and that different forms of replication stress can elicit discrete consequences at the same non-B DNA. As well, depletion of the replication factors Rad51, COPS2 or POLη alters the structure and mutagenic signatures of the eccDNAs in distinct ways.

The template switching domains in the eccDNAs are recurrent, but with nonidentical boundaries, and the patterns of overlap microhomology between switching events are strongly nonrandom and microsatellite-specific. We suggest that the avoidance of specific overlap lengths is determined not only by 3′ end microhomology, but also by additional sequences upstream of the 3′ end. This is consistent with suggestions that sequences upstream of the invading 3′ end are involved in the mechanism of selecting among multiple potential invasion sites (119,121). We also speculate that the same DNA damage tolerance polymerase may be responsible for successive template switch overlaps in individual reads.

Autonomous replication activity has been attributed to double minute chromosomes (157) and to random DNA sequences dependent on their length (109). We expect that a fraction of the eccDNAs that we have identified may have this ability, and note that the (ATTCT)47 and (CAG)102 c.10 cell lines display distinct populations of yellow cells with enhanced fluorescence, consistent with the presence of extrachromosomal copies of the dTomato gene or the eGFP gene. The putative ability of eccDNAs to replicate autonomously supports the possibility of ongoing replication-dependent mutation in these molecules.

Expanded CTG/CAG repeats form hairpins, stall replication forks, and are targets for DSBs in vivo (59,67). In agreement with a model of BIR from a deDSB, mutagenesis occurs upstream and downstream from DSBs at CTG/CAG microsatellites in the presence of replication stress, dependent on POLD3 and BRCA2 (22). In addition, mutagenesis and genome instability occur upstream and downstream of the (Pu/Py) mirror repeat polar replication barrier which recruits the DNA damage response proteins ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) and Rad9 (79).

H3 and G4 sequences derived from the PKD1 IVS21 (Pu/Py) repeat also cause gross chromosomal instability, and ligand-induced G4 non-B DNA induces mutagenesis at the upstream dTom and downstream eGFP reporters (21). Similarly, expanded ATTCT repeats induce hypermutagenesis and chromosome instability (30). Consistent with evidence that knockdown of the signalosome component COPS2 (20), Rad18, or the TLS polymerases POLη and POLκ, increase microsatellite instability (20,22), we show here that replication stress due to HU, APH or depletion of COPS2, POLη or Rad51 markedly affect eccDNA abundance and structure.

The prolonged lifetime of single stranded DNA during lagging strand replication or BIR is postulated to favor the formation of non-B DNA structures, including G quadruplexes (42,82,158,159). In human cells G quadruplexes form preferentially on the lagging strand replication template, and induce DNA strand breaks and BIR (21,22). In yeast, however, there are conflicting reports of the template preference for quadruplex formation under specific conditions (160,161). Consistent with the slow rate of BIR and the sustained ssDNA of the D-loop and nascent BIR DNA, the results of Figures 4 and Supplementary Figure 2 implicate G quadruplex forming sequences as frequent sites of instability during BIR and eccDNA formation.

Within the same parent DNA sequence (e.g. nonmicrosatellite segments of the ES), the pattern of template switching and the locations of mutations differ significantly between reads within a clone, and between sister or nonsister clones. Taking into account the number of population doublings in each of our clonal cell lines, we calculate mutagenesis rates in the eccDNAs (indel events plus substitutions) of ∼3.85 × 10−5/bp/generation–1.04 × 10−4/bp/generation. These mutations are found both upstream and downstream of the ectopic microsatellite sequence and the ectopic c-myc origin. The pattern and abundance of mutations suggest a bidirectional mechanism of BIR.

In S. cerevisiae, DSBs are repaired by long tract gene conversion (LTGC) and synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) if both ends have proximal homology on the sister chromatid (54,55,162), whereas mutagenic BIR from a single-ended DSB (seDSB) can occur if one parental strand at the DSB becomes ligated to a nascent DNA strand. Alternatively, bidirectional BIR can occur if the ends do not contain proximal (∼1–2 kb) homology on the donor DNA (135,162,163), or when the second end of the break is not captured, due to a converging fork, the absence of proteins that promote strand annealing (135,164–166) or due to singular structures of DNA or chromatin (101,167–178).

We have shown that replication of the ES initiates from the proximal c-myc origin in >90% of S-phases, that discrete DSBs occur at the downstream edge of the expanded (CTG/CAG) microsatellite (22), and that mutagenesis occurs upstream and downstream of a G4 forming sequence at the same ES (21). In yeast, triplex-prone (GAA) repeats form replication-dependent DSBs which lead to mutagenesis upstream and downstream of the break (179), consistent with our analyses of H3 cell reads. In the present work, sequence analysis reveals template switches, indels and substitution mutations extending >5–10 kb upstream and downstream of the ectopic ATTCT, CAG, H3 and G4 microsatellites within individual sequence reads. In addition, flow cytometry shows cells that delete or mutagenize both reporter genes, or exclusively lose expression of either the upstream dTomato marker or the downstream eGFP marker. Taken together, these observations are consistent with a role for BIR from a deDSB between the reporter genes in the generation of highly mutagenized eccDNAs.

There are certain limitations to our study. First, the maximum size of our iPCR products is ∼15 kb, and due to the iPCR strategy, we do not have information on DNA between the 5′ termini of the inverse primers. Therefore unknown DNA sequences could be present in the eccDNAs. We note, however, that in those cases where the Q5 polymerase has apparently copied the eccDNA templates by a rolling circle mechanism, the sequences between the primer 5′ ends are the expected ES sequences. Second, our data cannot be used to quantitate eccDNAs, due to the variability of PCR efficiency, and because of the unpredictability of eccDNA structures. Thus, recombinants that do not contain both forward and reverse primer binding sites are not visualized in this analysis.

Third, chromosomal common fragile sites (CFS) are frequently associated with late replicating, heterochromatic ‘replication slow zones’ (180), and fragility is enhanced by replication stress (181,182). In contrast, the endogenous and ectopic c-myc origins are early firing (22,183–185), GC rich, and present as open chromatin (183,186–188). Thus, our results may more likely reflect the properties of ‘early replicating fragile sites’ (189) than CFS’s.

BIR from a replication-dependent single-ended DSB has been proposed to account for repeat-induced mutagenesis (RIM) at triplex-forming GAA repeats (96) and hairpin prone CAG repeats (190). However, the precise mechanism of bidirectional mutagenesis during BIR remains an open question. Here, we propose an ‘asynchronous capture’ mechanism as an additional possibility for the repair of replication-dependent microsatellite DNA damage (191,192), in which endonuclease cleavage at a stalled replication fork results in bidirectional mutagenesis and the generation of eccDNAs (Figure 12). The model predicts that replication through the microsatellite and from a converging origin produces a deDSB (panel (A)). Delayed replication or 5′ resection of one end (panel (B)) leads to asynchronous capture of the 3′ ends by the sister chromatid or nonallelic chromosomes, and bidirectional D loop replication (panel (C)). Anti-recombinase/helicase displacement of the invading strands allows the completion of conservative DNA synthesis (panel (D), resulting in two chromosome fragments, each carrying a telomere end and a ‘BIR end’ (panel (D)). We speculate that the non-telomeric ‘BIR end’ chromosomes may be in a nuclear partition or focus which facilitates crossover or noncrossover HR. As such, cells carrying non-telomeric products (noncrossover HR) might be selected against, or the partial chromosomes degraded or appear broken. Crossover HR (panel (E)) would yield two structures, one of which is a chromosome containing two telomeres and a homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scar (123,139,140,193), and another chromosome with two ‘BIR ends’. In surviving cells, recombination at internal repeated eccDNA junction sequences in the chromosomes with ‘BIR ends’ could produce circular DNAs. Experiments are underway to test this hypothesis.

Figure 12. Proposed asynchronous capture model of BIR. (A) The rightward replication fork initiates at the c-myc origin (22), and the leftward fork initiates 8–20 kb downstream (58) to converge at the double strand break at non-B microsatellite DNA. (B) Asynchronous resection or capture of the DSB ends leads to (C) bidirectional BIR and template switching on the sister chromatid, the self chromosome (not shown) or a nonallelic chromosome. (D) Anti-recombinase/helicase activity allows displacement of the nascent DNA strands and completion of conservative replication, restoring the sister chromatid and producing two incomplete chromosomes, each with one telomere and one end determined by the extent of BIR (‘BIR end’). (E) Crossover homologous recombination results in one chromosome with two telomeric ends and an internal HRD ‘genomic scar’ and a second chromosome with two BIR ends. (F, G) The chromosome fragment with two BIR ends undergoes homology-dependent recombination at one or more repeated sequences to produce eccDNA(s).
