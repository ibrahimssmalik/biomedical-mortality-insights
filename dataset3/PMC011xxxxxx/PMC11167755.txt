==== Body
pmcThe Editor is issuing this Editorial Expression of Concern to inform readers that concerns have been raised about some of the data reported in this article [1]. Panels Con Anti-4HNE, 4w CCI4 Anti-4HNE, Curcumin with CII4, and Curcumin Anti-4HNE of Fig. 4b each appear to overlap with panels that were published in an article with common authors [2], which was under review simultaneously to this article. Several of these images were described differently in these two publications. After these concerns were raised, a correction was issued to [2] that removed these duplicating images from that article.

Han-Jung Chae has stated on behalf of all authors that they agree with this Editorial Expression of Concern.
