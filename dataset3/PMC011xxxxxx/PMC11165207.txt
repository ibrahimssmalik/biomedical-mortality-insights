pmc1 Introduction

MXenes are a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides that exhibit a unique combination of properties, making them highly versatile materials (Naguib et al., 2014). MXenes are derived from layered ternary carbide, nitride, or carbonitride precursors known as MAX phases. The structure involves selective etching (Ghidiu et al., 2014) of the “A” element layers (typically aluminum) from the MAX phase, leaving behind a 2D layered structure. The general formula for MXenes is Mn+1XnTx, where M represents a transition metal (e.g., titanium, tantalum, or niobium), X is carbon and/or nitrogen, T represents surface terminations (such as hydroxyl or fluorine), and n is the number of metal layers (Halim et al., 2014). Without the hydroxyl or oxygen termination, they are hydrophilic (Harris et al., 2015; Halim, Cook, et al., 2016). MXenes typically exhibit metallic conductivity, making them suitable for applications in electronics, sensors (Guo et al., 2019), and energy storage devices (Simon and Gogotsi, 2008; Meng et al., 2014; Kurra, Hota, and Alshareef, 2015). The presence of transition metal layers contributes to their excellent electronic conductivity. MXenes possess impressive mechanical properties, including high stiffness and strength, making them suitable for applications where mechanical integrity is crucial (Ling et al., 2014). MXenes are chemically stable in various environments, showing feasibility for oxidation and resistance to corrosion. MXenes and their oxides are promising topological materials that are experimentally and computationally studied (Parajuli and Samatha, 2022; 2019; Parajuli, Kaphle, and Samatha, 2019; Parajuli and Samatha, 2022; Parajuli, Uppugalla, et al., 2023) (S. Huang and Mochalin, 2019)(S. Huang and Mochalin, 2019). This stability contributes to their applicability in a wide range of conditions. The surface of MXenes is rich in functional groups, such as hydroxyl (OH-) and/or fluorine (F-) terminations, providing reactive sites for further functionalization. Surface functionalization enhances their compatibility with other materials and expands their application range (Harris et al., 2015; Halim, Cook, et al., 2016). MXenes typically have a high specific surface area due to their layered structure, which is advantageous for applications such as energy storage, catalysis, and sensing. MXenes exhibit interesting optical properties, including strong light absorption, which can be exploited in various optoelectronic and sensing applications. Their incorporation for energy storage were found more efficient that those we studied earlier (Parajuli, Murali, Samatha, and Veeraiah, 2022; Parajuli, Taddesse, Murali, Veeraiah, et al., 2022). MXenes demonstrate good thermal conductivity, making them promising candidates for applications in thermal management and electronic devices (Forrest, 2004; Y; Shi et al., 2015; Reese et al., 2004). The unique combination of electronic, mechanical, chemical, and optical properties makes MXenes a promising class of materials with diverse applications in fields ranging from electronics and energy storage to catalysis and biomedicine (Z. Liu et al., 2018; C; Dai, Chen, et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; X; Han et al., 2018) (C. Dai, Lin, et al., 2017).

The different types of MXenes derived from their precursors through their selective etching processes are shown in Figure 1A, it showcases three categories of mono-M MAX phases: M2AX, M3AX2, and M4AX3, along with the selective etching procedure targeting the A-group layers (depicted by red atoms). In Figure 1B, it follows the selective etching process, MXenes emerge, characterized by the formation of surface terminations (depicted by yellow atoms) denoted as T. Figure 1C presents the potential elements for M, A, X, and T in both MAX and MXene phases. Additionally, although MXenes with orders as high as M5X4 have been successfully synthesized, they are not included in this table. It’s noteworthy that while Mn occupies the M sites in MAX phases, MXenes containing Mn have not been synthesized to date, indicated by the horizontally patterned background of Mn.

MXenes in addition to their exhibiting excellent electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and chemical stability, often lack certain properties required for specific applications (Bilibana, 2023). By incorporating MXenes into different matrices such as polymers, ceramics, or metals, it can be exploited synergistic effects to achieve desired functionalities. For instance, MXene nanocomposites can offer improved mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and even functionalities like electromagnetic interference shielding or energy storage (Gao et al., 2020). These nanocomposites find applications across various fields including energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors, electromagnetic shielding materials, sensors, catalysis, and biomedical devices. The versatility and tunability of MXene nanocomposites make them highly desirable for addressing specific needs in diverse technological domains (Perera et al., 2023). MXenes exhibit chemical stability, resisting oxidation and corrosion, contributing to the durability of nanocomposites in various environments (W. Wu et al., 2019a; M; Zhu et al., 2016b). MXenes can be synthesized with different transition metals, providing versatility in tailoring their properties for specific nanocomposite applications (Naguib et al., 2016).

In nanocomposite applications, MXenes are often combined with polymers, ceramics, or other materials to create hybrid materials with enhanced or multifunctional properties. The combination of these MXene properties allows for the development of advanced nanocomposites with diverse applications across various fields.

Common etchants include hydrofluoric acid (HF) or a combination of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and an oxidizing agent. The etching process exposes the MXene layers, creating a 2D structure (Naguib et al., 2012).

3.2.1.2 Washing and delamination

After etching, the resulting MXene flakes are thoroughly washed to remove residual etchants and by-products. This step is crucial for the removal of any remaining A-element residues. Delamination processes, such as intercalation of ions or molecules, may be employed to exfoliate MXene layers and enhance their dispersibility (Ling et al., 2014).

3.2.1.3 Surface functionalization

MXene surfaces often have terminations, such as hydroxyl (-OH) or fluorine (-F), which affect their properties. Surface functionalization can be performed to introduce desired functional groups, enhancing their compatibility with other materials or improving specific characteristics.

MXenes are frequently integrated into polymer matrices to form nanocomposites. This can be achieved through methods like solution mixing, melt blending, or in situ polymerization. The choice of polymer and the synthesis method can be tailored to achieve the desired properties for specific applications (Khazaei et al., 2013; Ashton et al., 2016; T; Hu et al., 2015).

3.2.1.4 Drying and powder formation

The resulting MXene dispersion is often dried to produce a powder form for ease of handling and storage. Techniques like freeze-drying or spray-drying are commonly employed to preserve the 2D structure.

3.2.1.5 MXene-polymer nanocomposite formation

The schematic representation of the synthesis cycle for the MXene-SP composite is illustrated in Figure 4. The bottom-up methodology can also be employed for MXene synthesis through techniques such as EVD (Manawi et al., 2018).

3.2.2 Solution mixing

They are simple and cost-effective, suitable for a wide range of polymers, and allow for precise control over the composition. However, they are limited to polymers soluble in the chosen solvent and may require additional steps for complete mixing and dispersion. Advanced mixing techniques, such as sonication or high-shear mixing, can be used to improve dispersion. Solution mixing is a common and straightforward method for preparing MXene-polymer nanocomposites (Maleski, Mochalin, and Gogotsi, 2017).

3.2.2.1 Material and method

The MXene of interest, such as titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) or others, is prepared through appropriate synthesis methods. The chosen polymer, compatible with the solvent is used for MXene dispersion. Common polymers include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), or others. A solvent in which both MXene and the polymer are soluble. Common solvents include water, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A sonicator is needed to assist in dispersing MXene and polymer in the solvent. For continuous mixing during the preparation is done by magnetic stirrer or stirring rod. A suitable container is used for mixing and storing the nanocomposite solution.

The MXene is dispersed in the chosen solvent, with uniform dispersion often achieved through sonication. For example, a desired amount of MXene powder is added to the solvent, and the mixture is sonicated for a specific duration until a well-dispersed MXene solution is obtained. The polymer is dissolved in the same solvent used for MXene dispersion, with the solution stirred until the polymer is fully dissolved, forming a clear polymer solution. The MXene solution is slowly added into the polymer solution while continuously stirring, with this process carried out dropwise to ensure a gradual and homogeneous mixture. The combined solution is stirred for an extended period to ensure proper mixing and distribution of MXene within the polymer matrix. Depending on the desired concentration of MXene in the nanocomposite, the ratio of MXene to polymer solutions is adjusted, with this step potentially requiring optimization based on the specific application. The resulting nanocomposite solution is characterized to ensure the desired properties, with techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), or other relevant methods employed. Depending on the application, the nanocomposite solution can be cast into films or coatings or dried to obtain the final nanocomposite material.

3.2.2.2 Considerations

In this process, some special considerations are needed. The concentration of MXene, polymer, and the ratio between them should be optimized based on the desired properties of the nanocomposite. The choice of solvent is critical, as it affects the solubility of both MXene and the polymer. Consideration should be given to environmental and safety aspects when selecting solvents. Proper sonication is essential to ensure a well-dispersed MXene solution, preventing agglomeration. Sufficient stirring time is crucial for achieving a homogeneous nanocomposite solution.

3.2.3 In-situ polymerization

They are a direct synthesis of nanocomposites during polymerization and have good control over the nanocomposite structure. They are suitable for a variety of polymer matrices. However, they are limited to polymers that can undergo in situ polymerization, and reaction conditions may affect MXene properties. The development of controlled polymerization methods for better control over nanocomposite structure. In situ polymerization is a method for preparing MXene-polymer nanocomposites in which the polymerization of monomers occurs directly in the presence of dispersed MXene sheets.

Due to limited polymerization energy, only certain types of monomers can undergo polymerization on the surface of MXenes through methods such as physical agitation, UV radiation, or electrochemical processes (C. Chen et al., 2017) (J. Chen et al., 2014; Boota et al., 2016). Chen et al. proposed two primary electron transfer mechanisms during the charge-transfer-induced polymerization of 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) under agitation. In one mechanism, electrons transition from the high-energy orbits (HOMOs) of the monomer to the lower-energy orbits (LUMOs) of the MXene, while in the other, electrons shift from the HOMOs of the MXene to the LUMOs of the monomer (Figure 6A) (C. Chen et al., 2017). Additionally, proximity between the monomer and MXene surface is crucial for efficient electron transfer during polymerization. Leveraging hydroxyl and fluorine terminations, 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) was successfully polymerized on the surface of V2C (Figure 6B) (J. Chen et al., 2014), leading to the formation of PDMAEMA grafted V2C with demonstrated sensitivity to CO2 and temperature. Furthermore, MXene/polypyrrole (PPy) composites were synthesized via electrochemical polymerization by Zhu et al., involving the electrolysis of a pyrrole-containing solution with a Ti3C2-modified electrode. Although in situ polymerization ensures a uniform distribution of polymers on the MXene surface, it may alter the properties of MXene materials during the process.

3.2.3.1 Material and method

In this method, the monomers are required for polymerization to make nanocomposite with the MXene of interest, such as titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx). Common monomers include acrylic acid, acrylamide, or other suitable monomers compatible with the polymerization conditions. A suitable initiator to initiate the polymerization reaction. Common initiators include ammonium persulfate (APS), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), or others, depending on the polymerization mechanism. A solvent in which both MXene and the monomers are dispersible. Common solvents include water, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A suitable reaction vessel equipped with a stirring mechanism and temperature control is needed.

The MXene is dispersed in the chosen solvent to achieve a stable MXene dispersion, potentially involving sonication for uniform dispersion. The desired monomers are dissolved in the solvent to prepare the monomer solution, with the concentration adjusted based on the nanocomposite (NC) properties. e.g., epoxies (Sliozberg et al., 2020; H; Zhang et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2018) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) like polymers are mixed from one side.

The most common reports of insitu polymerizations for MXene polymer NCs are of curing systems, such as epoxies (Hatter et al., 2020; Sliozberg et al., 2020) (A. Feng et al., 2020) and PDMS (D. Hu et al., 2020) (X. Wu et al., 2020)(D. Wang et al., 2020) aqueous solutions have been reported in the case of PPy (Zhu et al., 2016a; Boota et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2020), polyaniline (Vahidmohammadi et al., 2018; Y; Ren et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2019; Vahidmohammadi et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020), PAM(Zhang et al., 2019), PAM/PVA (Liao et al., 2019) and PEDOT (Chen et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2019), that can be polymerized with acetonitrile (Li et al., 2019).

The initiator is added to the monomer solution, its amount is determined by polymerization kinetics and reaction rate preferences. The MXene dispersion is slowly added into the monomer solution while continuously stirring to uniformly disperse MXene sheets. Polymerization is initiated by raising the temperature or other suitable methods activating the initiator. The polymerization reaction proceeds for the specified duration under controlled conditions. The resulting MXene-polymer nanocomposite is characterized using techniques such as FTIR, SEM, or other relevant methods. The nanocomposite material is isolated from the reaction mixture through filtration or other separation techniques and washed to remove unreacted monomers or by-products. Finally, the nanocomposite material is dried to obtain the final product.

3.2.3.2 Considerations

The polymerization conditions, including temperature, initiator concentration, and reaction time, to achieve the desired properties of the nanocomposite are optimized. Continuous stirring are ensured during the polymerization reaction to promote uniform dispersion of MXene sheets and facilitate homogeneous polymerization. Thorough characterization of the nanocomposite material are done to evaluate its structure, morphology, and properties.

In-situ polymerization offers precise control over the nanocomposite structure and properties, making it a valuable method for preparing MXene-polymer nanocomposites with tailored characteristics for specific applications. Adjustments can be made to this general procedure based on the choice of monomers, initiators, or MXene types.

3.2.4 Melt blending

Melt blending is a commonly used method for preparing MXene-polymer nanocomposites, particularly when working with thermoplastic polymers (Figure 7). They are scalable and applicable to various polymer matrices, suitable for industrial-scale production, and are simple with cost-effective. However, they are limited to thermoplastic polymers and may require high processing temperatures. The optimization of processing parameters improves dispersion and mechanical properties (Sheng et al., 2019).

FIGURE 7 Creation of MXene/polymer composites through ex-situ solution blending. Reproduced with authorization from reference (Mirkhani et al., 2019). © 2019 American Chemical Society.

Ex-situ blending methods (Figure 7) are frequently utilized due to their ease in regulating the properties of polymer and MXene precursors. Leveraging their relatively modest interactions, such as van der Waals attraction, hydrogen bonding force, and electrostatic interaction, MXene/polymer composites are predominantly produced through solution mixing (Figure 7).

3.2.4.1 Material and method

The MXene of interest, such as titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) or others, is prepared through appropriate synthesis methods. The chosen thermoplastic polymer, is compatible with the processing temperature and MXene dispersion. A twin-screw extruder or internal mixer capable of high-temperature processing and efficient mixing. Additives such as compatibilizers, plasticizers, or stabilizers may be used to improve dispersion or enhance properties.

The MXene powder is properly dried to remove any residual moisture, as moisture can affect processing and properties. The thermoplastic polymer pellets are pre-dried to remove moisture and ensure uniform processing, with any desired additives optionally incorporated into the polymer pellets. The dried MXene powder and polymer pellets are loaded into the mixing equipment in the desired ratios, with the loading ratio adjusted based on the desired properties of the nanocomposite. The mixing equipment is heated to the appropriate processing temperature, typically above the melting point of the polymer. The mixing process is started, allowing the MXene powder and polymer pellets to melt and blend thoroughly, with high shear forces generated during mixing helping to disperse MXene within the polymer matrix. After thorough mixing, the molten mixture is extruded or discharged from the mixing equipment onto a cooling conveyor or casting surface. The mixture is allowed to cool and solidify, forming the MXene-polymer nanocomposite in the desired shape (e.g., pellets, sheets, or films). Further processing steps such as pelletizing, compression molding, or injection molding may be applied to the resulting nanocomposite material depending on the intended application. The nanocomposite material is characterized to evaluate its structure, morphology, and properties, with techniques such as SEM, XRD, or mechanical testing employed.

3.2.4.2 Consideration

The processing temperature should be carefully controlled to ensure proper melting of the polymer and dispersion of MXene while avoiding degradation of either component. Sufficient mixing time is essential to achieve uniform dispersion of MXene within the polymer matrix. Longer mixing times may be required for higher loading levels or less compatible polymer-MXene combinations. The incorporation of additives, such as compatibilizers or plasticizers, may improve the dispersion and compatibility of MXene within the polymer matrix. Melt blending involves high temperatures and mechanical shear forces. Proper safety precautions should be followed to prevent accidents or injuries.

Melt blending offers scalability and versatility, making it suitable for industrial-scale production of MXene-polymer nanocomposites. Adjustments to processing parameters can be made based on the specific polymer-MXene combination and intended application requirements.

3.2.5 Layer-by-layer assembly

This process has precise control over layer arrangement, suitable for a variety of polymers and MXenes. They can be used for thin films and coatings. However, the process is time-consuming and is limited to specific applications due to its layer-to-layer nature. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly (Figure 8) is a versatile technique for fabricating MXene-polymer nanocomposites with precise control over layer thickness and composition (Chen et al., 2020).

Common solvents include water, ethanol, or other polar solvents. A solid substrate on which the LbL assembly will take place. Common substrates include silicon wafers, glass slides, or functionalized surfaces. Additives such as crosslinkers or stabilizers may be used to enhance film stability or modify properties.

The MXene is dispersed in the chosen solvent to create a stable MXene dispersion, with sonication or high-shear mixing possibly utilized to achieve uniform dispersion. The chosen polymer is dissolved in the solvent to generate a polymer solution or dispersion, with the polymer concentration adjustable based on desired film properties. The substrate is thoroughly cleaned to remove any contaminants or residues that may affect film formation, and optionally, the substrate surface is functionalized to promote adhesion or enhance film stability. The process is repeated by immersing the substrate in the polymer solution, allowing the polymer to adsorb onto the MXene-coated substrate surface. The substrate is rinsed with solvent to eliminate any unbound polymer molecules and stabilize the polymer layer. Deposition of MXene and polymer layers is continued alternately until the desired number of layers is achieved, with control over the sequence and thickness of layers by adjusting deposition parameters. Post-treatment steps, such as crosslinking or annealing, may be performed to enhance film stability or modify properties. The assembled MXene-polymer nanocomposite film is characterized to evaluate its structure, morphology, and properties, with techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), ellipsometry, or spectroscopic methods employed.

3.2.5.2 Consideration

The pH and ionic strength of the deposition solutions can influence layer deposition and film properties, so these parameters should be controlled and optimized. Parameters such as immersion time, solution concentration, and drying conditions can affect film thickness and quality and should be carefully optimized. The substrate material and surface properties can influence film adhesion, stability, and performance, so substrate selection should be based on the desired application. LbL assembly allows for precise control over film composition, enabling the incorporation of multiple materials and functionalities into the nanocomposite film.

However, they require specialized equipment and are limited to certain polymers and MXenes. Integration of electrospinning with other techniques for multifunctional nanocomposites may overcome this difficulty. Electrospinning is a versatile and widely used method for fabricating nanofibrous structures, including MXene-polymer nanocomposites (Ziabicki, 1976).

3.2.6.1 Material and method

After the preparation of the MXene of interest, such as titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), through an appropriate synthesis method, a polymer is chosen which is typically in the form of a solution or melt suitable for electrospinning. Common polymers include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene oxide (PEO), or others. A solvent suitable for both MXene dispersion and polymer dissolution. Common solvents include water, dimethylformamide (DMF), or other polar solvents. A grounded collector, typically in the form of a rotating drum or flat plate, collects the electrospun fibers. A high voltage power supply capable of generating electric fields in the range of 1–30 kV. A syringe pump or similar device for controlled delivery of the polymer solution during electrospinning. A spinneret or needle with a fine tip, through which the polymer solution is extruded during electrospinning (D. Li and Xia, 2004).

The MXene is dispersed in the chosen solvent to create a stable MXene dispersion, with sonication or high-shear mixing possibly employed to achieve uniform dispersion. The chosen polymer is dissolved in the solvent to form a polymer solution, with the polymer concentration optimized for electrospinning, typically in the range of 5%–20% w/v. The electrospinning apparatus is set up in a controlled environment to prevent airflow disturbances, and the grounded collector is positioned at an appropriate distance (usually 10–20 cm) from the spinneret. The polymer solution is loaded into a syringe or reservoir connected to the spinneret, ensuring it is free of air bubbles to prevent disruption during electrospinning. A high voltage (typically in the range of 1–30 kV) is applied between the spinneret and the collector to generate an electric field, initiating the electrospinning process by dispensing the polymer solution through the spinneret at a controlled flow rate (typically in the range of 0.1–10 mL/h). The electric field induces a charge on the surface of the polymer solution droplet, leading to the formation of a Taylor cone and subsequent elongation into nanofibers. Simultaneously, the MXene dispersion is introduced into the polymer solution or applied directly onto the collector to incorporate MXene into the electrospun fibers. The electrospun fibers are collected onto the grounded collector, forming a nonwoven mat or membrane, with the rotating drum or flat plate possibly used to facilitate continuous fiber collection. Post-treatment steps, such as drying, crosslinking, or annealing, may be performed to enhance fiber stability or modify properties. The electrospun MXene-polymer nanocomposite fibers are characterized to evaluate their structure, morphology, and properties, with techniques such as SEM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), or mechanical testing employed (Merritt et al., 2012; Keirouz et al., 2020).

3.2.6.2 Consideration

The polymer concentration and solvent composition are optimized to achieve the desired solution viscosity for electrospinning. Control electrospinning parameters such as voltage, flow rate, and distance between the spinneret and collector to obtain uniform and well-aligned fibers. Uniform dispersion of MXene is ensured within the polymer solution to facilitate its incorporation into the electrospun fibers and enhance their properties. Cautions are exercised when working with high voltages and organic solvents, and follow appropriate safety protocols to prevent accidents or injuries.

Electrospinning offers precise control over fiber diameter, morphology, and composition, making it a valuable technique for fabricating MXene-polymer nanocomposite fibers with tailored properties for various applications such as filtration, tissue engineering, and sensors. Optimization of electrospinning parameters and thorough characterization are essential for achieving desired fiber properties and performance.

3.2.7 Chemical vapor deposition

They allow for direct synthesis on substrates and have uniform coatings on various surfaces along with precise control over film thickness. However, they require specialized equipment and are limited to specific substrates. These days, the scalability is improved, and have control over the CVD process. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a method commonly used for the synthesis of thin films or coatings of MXene-polymer nanocomposites on solid substrates (Shareef et al., 1995; Schropp et al., 2000; Hamzan et al., 2021).

3.2.7.1 Material and method

The chosen polymer precursor, typically in the form of a vapor or gas, will react or deposit onto the substrate surface. A solid substrate onto which the MXene-polymer nanocomposite film will be deposited. Common substrates include silicon wafers, glass slides, or functionalized surfaces. A CVD reactor is equipped with the necessary components for gas flow control, temperature control, and vacuum pumping. An inert carrier gas such as nitrogen or argon, is used to transport the polymer precursor vapor to the substrate. Additives such as catalysts or dopants may be used to modify film properties or promote deposition. The substrate is thoroughly cleaned to remove any contaminants or residues that may affect film deposition, with the substrate surface optionally functionalized to promote adhesion or enhance film properties. The MXene powder is loaded onto a substrate holder inside the CVD reactor, ensuring uniform dispersion of MXene particles on the substrate surface. The polymer precursor is prepared in the desired form for CVD deposition, which may involve heating the precursor to its vaporization temperature or introducing it as a gas into the CVD reactor. The CVD reactor is purged with an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen or argon) to remove air and moisture. The polymer precursor vapor or gas is introduced into the CVD reactor at the desired flow rate, and the substrate is heated to the appropriate temperature for polymer deposition, typically in the range of 100°C–300°C. The polymer precursor reacts or deposits onto the substrate surface, forming a thin film or coating. Alternatively, MXene can be simultaneously deposited with the polymer precursor by introducing MXene vapor or gas into the CVD reactor alongside the polymer precursor. Deposition parameters such as temperature, precursor flow rate, and deposition time are controlled to achieve the desired film thickness and properties. Post-treatment steps, such as annealing or surface modification, may be performed to enhance film properties or stability. The deposited MXene-polymer nanocomposite film is characterized to evaluate its structure, morphology, and properties, with techniques such as SEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), or spectroscopic methods employed.

A novel method utilizing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been uncovered for the direct production of ultrathin MXene materials, offering a new avenue for MXene-based material fabrication (Gogotsi, 2015) (C. Xu et al., 2015; Geng et al., 2017). By employing methane as a carbon source over a Cu/Mo alloyed surface at temperatures surpassing 1085°C (Figures 9A–C) (Gogotsi, 2015) (C. Xu et al., 2015) large-area high-quality 2D ultrathin α-Mo2C crystals (−3 nm) were successfully synthesized. Control over crystal size and thickness was achieved through manipulation of experimental conditions, where growth time influenced lateral size while growth temperature affected nucleation density. The method demonstrated versatility in generating various crystal shapes, including triangles, rectangles, hexagons, octagons, nonagons, and dodecagons, all exhibiting hexagonal packing of Mo atoms. Furthermore, enabling the fabrication of ultrathin β-Mo2C nanosheets using a rapid and scalable synthesis approach involving MoO2 nanosheets as templates and Mo sources. Unlike 2D materials obtained from alternative methods, CVD-fabricated MXenes showcased fewer defects and terminations, facilitating comprehensive investigations into their intrinsic properties and domain boundaries’ effects. The exploration of bottom-up synthetic approaches is encouraged to prepare other types of monolayered MXenes with diverse functionalities, thereby enabling further investigations into their inherent electronic and optical properties (Gogotsi, 2015; Jeon et al., 2018; Sang et al., 2018)(L. Wang et al., 2016).

The MXene is dispersed in the chosen solvent to create a stable MXene dispersion, with sonication or high-shear mixing potentially employed to achieve uniform dispersion. The chosen polymer is dissolved in the solvent to form a polymer solution or dispersion, with the polymer concentration optimized for the hydrothermal/solvothermal conditions. The MXene dispersion and polymer solution are mixed in the desired ratio to obtain a homogeneous MXene-polymer mixture, ensuring thorough mixing to achieve uniform dispersion of MXene within the polymer matrix. The MXene-polymer mixture is transferred into a sealed autoclave or reaction vessel suitable for hydrothermal/solvothermal reactions, ensuring the vessel is clean and free of contaminants. The autoclave or reaction vessel is heated to the desired temperature for the hydrothermal/solvothermal reaction, typically ranging from 100°C to 250°C, depending on the polymer and MXene used. The reaction temperature is maintained for a specified duration to allow for the synthesis of the MXene-polymer nanocomposite. After the reaction is complete, the autoclave or reaction vessel is cooled to room temperature, and the MXene-polymer nanocomposite product is retrieved. The product may be in the form of a gel, powder, or precipitate, depending on the reaction conditions. Post-treatment steps, such as washing, drying, or annealing, may be performed to remove any unreacted precursors or by-products and to enhance the properties of the nanocomposite material.

Production of hydrophobic polymers in industrial and academic scales (Hohenstein and Mark, 1946) They are suitable for water-soluble polymers and have good control over particle size and distribution. However, they are limited to specific polymer types and may require additional steps for nanocomposite formation. The novel emulsion systems are developed for improved stability. Emulsion polymerization is a versatile method for preparing polymer-MXene nanocomposites in the form of latex particles dispersed in an aqueous medium (Whitby and Katz, 1933).

A water-soluble initiator to initiate the polymerization reaction in the aqueous phase. Common initiators include potassium persulfate (KPS), ammonium persulfate (APS), or hydrogen peroxide. Water is the continuous phase for emulsion polymerization. Optionally, a stabilizer such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be added to improve stability and control particle size.

The MXene is dispersed in water using mechanical agitation or sonication to obtain a stable aqueous dispersion, with the MXene concentration optimized based on the desired loading in the nanocomposite. The emulsion is prepared by mixing the MXene dispersion with the surfactant solution, with the surfactant concentration optimized to ensure the stabilization of the emulsion. The chosen monomer or monomer mixture is dissolved in water-soluble initiators to form the aqueous monomer phase, with the monomer concentration adjustable based on the desired properties of the polymer-MXene nanocomposite. The polymerization reaction is initiated by adding the monomer solution to the emulsion under stirring or agitation, with the addition performed gradually to control the particle size and nucleation rate. The reaction temperature is maintained, and stirring continues until the polymerization is complete, typically controlled below the boiling point of water. During polymerization, MXene particles become embedded within the growing polymer particles, forming a polymer-MXene nanocomposite. The surfactant molecules at the interface between water and monomer droplets stabilize the growing polymer particles, preventing coalescence. After polymerization, the nanocomposite latex can undergo post-polymerization treatments such as purification, drying, or chemical modification to remove unreacted monomers or improve their properties. The synthesized polymer-MXene nanocomposite is characterized to evaluate its structure, morphology, and properties, with techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), TEM, or mechanical testing employed.

3.2.9.2 Consideration

An appropriate surfactant is selected to stabilize the emulsion and control particle size during polymerization. Select monomers compatible with water-based emulsion polymerization and capable of forming stable latex particles. Water-soluble initiators are used for polymerization in the aqueous phase, ensuring efficient initiation and control of the reaction. Maintain appropriate stirring and temperature conditions throughout the polymerization process to ensure uniform particle formation and polymerization kinetics.

Emulsion polymerization offers advantages such as easy scalability, control over particle size, and compatibility with aqueous systems, making it a promising method for preparing polymer-MXene nanocomposites in latex form. Optimization of parameters and thorough characterization are essential for tailoring the properties of the nanocomposite for specific applications.

Each synthesis method has its own set of considerations, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the application. Recent advancements often focus on improving scalability, efficiency, and control over the nanocomposite’s structure and properties. Exploration is going on innovative approaches to enhance the performance and broaden the applicability of MXene-polymer nanocomposites in diverse fields.

3.2.10 Characterization

Techniques such as XRD and TEM are used to confirm the 2D structure and layer spacing of MXenes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and FTIR help analyze the chemical composition and functional groups on the MXene surface. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis is commonly used to determine the specific surface area of MXenes, providing insights into their porosity.

MXene synthesis methods are continuously evolving, with an exploration of new etchants, delamination techniques, and polymer integration strategies to enhance the properties and applications of these unique materials. The ability to customize MXene structures and incorporate them into nanocomposites opens up a wide range of possibilities for various technological advancements.

The nanocomposites showed efficient tumor ablation and simultaneous imaging capability for guiding therapy (H. Li et al., 2021).

4.3 Biosensors

Biosensors are employed to identify specific elements within the human body. These devices consist of several components: a sensing element, a transducer, and a data interpreter (Prajapati and Kandasubramanian, 2019). The sensing element, typically an immobilized biomolecule like an enzyme, can detect the concentration of a target analyte in its vicinity, generating a biochemical signal. This signal is then converted into an electrical signal by a transducer and subsequently interpreted by a data interpreter. In a study by Rakhi and colleagues, they developed an enzymatic biosensor (GOx/Au/Ti3C2/Nafion/GCE) for detecting glucose (Rakhi et al., 2016). Glucose is converted into gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the action of the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx). The presence of glucose leads to the production of peroxide, generating a high potential indicative of glucose levels. Nafion facilitates the enzyme’s adhesion to the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) (Harper and Anderson, 2010).

In Biosensing and detection, Li et al. (2020) synthesized MXene-polymer nanocomposites for glucose biosensing applications. The nanocomposites exhibited high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and rapid response toward glucose detection, showing promise for diabetes management and point-of-care testing (X.

Some synthesis routes may require expensive equipment, specialized facilities, or energy-intensive processes, increasing production expenses. Optimizing synthesis methods to minimize energy consumption or utilizing simpler techniques can help reduce costs (Jolly, Paranthaman, and Naguib, 2021). High-temperature synthesis methods such as MAX phase etching and exfoliation may require energy-intensive processes, increasing operational costs. For example, the energy cost for heating furnaces or reactors can be significant, ranging from several hundred to thousands of dollars per batch depending on the scale and duration of the synthesis process. Alternatively, low-temperature synthesis methods, such as the use of ionic liquids or mild etchants, may reduce energy consumption but could require specialized equipment or reagents, impacting upfront capital costs (Jolly, Paranthaman, and Naguib, 2021).

6.1.7.3 Process efficiency

The efficiency of the synthesis process affects the yield of desired MXene-polymer nanocomposites per unit of input materials. Low efficiency may result in the wastage of raw materials, energy, and time, driving up production costs. Improving process efficiency through better reaction conditions, catalysts, or purification methods can lower overall costs (Tan et al., 2024).• Yield of desired MXene product: Efficiency in converting precursor materials into high-quality MXene affects production costs. Higher yields reduce material wastage and associated costs.

• Time required for synthesis: Longer reaction times or complex purification processes can increase labor and energy costs. Optimizing reaction conditions and purification steps can improve process efficiency and reduce overall production time and costs.

6.1.7.4 Labor costs

Skilled labor is essential for synthesizing MXene-polymer nanocomposites, especially in research and development phases where experimentation and optimization are common. Labor costs can significantly impact the overall synthesis cost, particularly if extensive manual intervention is required. Automation and streamlining of processes can help mitigate labor expenses (Islam and Shazali, 2011).• Skilled labor wages: Labor costs vary widely depending on location, expertise required, and labor market conditions. For example, researchers or technicians involved in MXene synthesis may earn salaries ranging from $40,000 to $100,000 or more annually, depending on experience and qualifications.

• Automation and process optimization: Investments in automation technologies and streamlined processes can reduce labor requirements and associated costs over time.

6.1.7.5 Scale of production

Economies of scale have a significant impact on synthesis costs, as larger production volumes often lead to reduced unit costs (Shuck et al., 2020a). However, expanding production while ensuring consistent quality can be challenging. To achieve cost-effective large-scale production, investments in infrastructure, equipment, and process optimization are essential. The advantages of economies of scale become apparent as production volumes increase, allowing fixed costs to be spread out over a larger output (Shuck et al., 2020). This typically results in lower unit costs. Nevertheless, the initial investments required to scale up production facilities and equipment can be considerable. For instance, transitioning from laboratory-scale to pilot-scale or industrial-scale production may necessitate investments ranging from thousands to millions of dollars. The magnitude of investment depends on factors such as the complexity of the process and the desired output capacity (Charitidis et al., 2014).

6.1.7.6 Purification and characterization

Purification steps to remove impurities and characterization techniques to assess product quality add to the synthesis cost. These processes require additional materials, equipment, and labor. Developing efficient purification methods and adopting cost-effective characterization techniques can help manage these expenses (H. Tang et al., 2021).• Cost of purification agents and equipment: Purification processes, such as acid washing or filtration, require chemicals, solvents, and specialized equipment. For example, the cost of membrane filtration systems for removing impurities can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on capacity and efficiency.

• Analytical techniques: Characterization methods such as SEM, XRD, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) incur costs for instrument purchase, maintenance, and consumables.
