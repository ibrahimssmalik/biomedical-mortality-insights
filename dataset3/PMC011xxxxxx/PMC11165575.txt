Racemic 9,10-diketo[7]helicene was successfully separated into enantiomers using a reversible and stereoselective reaction with 2,2′-diamino-1,1′-binaphthalene with moderate yields but with remarkable purity (>99% de). The enantiomerically pure diketone was used as a convenient starting material for the preparation of helicene-based push–pull molecules, which incorporated aza-aryl acceptors and diarylaminophenylene donor groups in a single step. A series of six push–pull systems, along with three reference molecules without donors, were prepared and studied using UV/vis and fluorescence measurements, circular dichroism, and DFT calculations.

Nonplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have garnered significant interest in recent years as an alternative to planar aromatics and nanographenes. The appeal of these compounds stems from their advantageous properties, such as enhanced solubility, unique optical and electronic behaviors, and altered intermolecular contact compared to their planar counterparts.1,2 Among these, helicenes stand out as a particularly well-studied class, offering a rich array of properties not commonly found in planar systems.3−6 Despite being known for decades, the unique properties of these molecules are only now being utilized in a variety of applications. For example, helicenes have been used in devices detecting circularly polarized light (CPL)7 and have shown promise in the areas of nonlinear optics, spin filtering and plasmonics, and photoswitches.8−13 Most notably, the ability of helicenes to emit CPL14 offers opportunities for the development of next-generation CPL-responsive OLEDs and other light-emitting devices.15,16 However, wider application of helicenes in OLEDs is mainly hindered by their generally low fluorescence quantum yields caused by radiationless intersystem crossing (ISC), which can reach a quantum yield of 0.9 in helicenes.17

To optimize the attributes of helicenes for high-performance materials, targeted substitution patterns are often essential. One of the most effective ways to influence the extended π-system of helicenes involves creating a push–pull system by the introduction of both electron donors and electron acceptors interconnected via a π-system. The presence of such a system facilitates intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions, which are responsible for enhancing the absorption of these molecules in the visible range, modifying the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, and altering the redox behavior of the compounds. Helicene-based push–pull systems have found applications in various fields. For example, simple [5]helicene and tetrahydro[5]helicene-based push–pull compounds (Figure 1, I and II) have displayed significantly improved fluorescence properties compared to unsubstituted helicene.18−21 In another study, tetrathia[9]helicene (Figure 1, III) was synthesized specifically to manipulate its excited-state dynamics and CPL properties.22 Recently, we published an example of 2,6-disubstituted push–pull systems based on [6]helicene phosphine oxides (Figure 1, IV) that exhibited significant solvatochromism.23 Some of these compounds have been employed in various molecular devices, including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)24 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).25

Figure 1 Selected examples of helicene-based push–pull systems and this work.

A significant challenge in the practical use of helicenes lies in obtaining them in their enantiomerically pure forms. The most effective strategy thus far for resolving racemic helicenes, while avoiding the use of chromatography on chiral stationary phases, has been the formation of diastereomers through the use of appropriate chiral agents. This methodology has successfully resolved helicene derivatives containing hydroxy-,26 thia-,27 and aza-functions,28 or carboxylic acids,29 among others.30 Interestingly, this methodology is typically used for helicenes modified at the terminal rings to ensure sufficient spatial interaction of the helicene’s chiral cavity with the chiral agent. The effectivity of this approach for helicenes substituted on their central rings is, to the best of our knowledge, very limited so far.

In this study, we aim to fill this gap by introducing a novel kinetic resolution technique for a helicene-based diketone, 9,10-diketo[7]helicene. This is followed by a one- step synthetic procedure to construct D-A-D push–pull systems with an appended helicene moiety. The synthesized compounds are subjected to characterization through UV/vis spectroscopy, fluorescence studies, measurements of circular dichroism (CD) spectra and DFT calculations.

Results and Discussion

9,10-Diketo[7]helicene (1) serves as a versatile starting material for the preparation of various helicene-based molecules, particularly nitrogen-containing heterocycles, as previous studies have shown;31−33 however, it has not yet been possible to obtain their enantiomers.

Initially, we attempted to resolve 1 using a chiral HPLC. Although the analytical separation was sufficient (δRT = 5 min, Figure S21), the transition to the semipreparative mode was problematic due to long retention time and low solubility of 1. The attempt to use a more soluble ethylene glycol diacetal derivative for chromatographic resolution did not lead to higher amounts of enantiopure 1, as additional synthetic steps were required (Figure S22).

Consequently, we shifted our focus to kinetic resolution. Our choice of racemic 1,1′-binaphthyl-2,2′-diamine (rac-2) initially yielded a product, rac-3, whose X-ray structure (Figure S31) revealed the presence of only (S,P)- and (R,M)-enantiomers. Since the resulting diazacyclooctadiene ring is known to be sufficiently stable in aromatic compounds,34 while the axially chiral binaphthalenes retain their handedness at elevated temperatures,35 we expected that using only one enantiomer of 2 would yield a single diastereomer of 3. The reaction of (rac)-1 with one equivalent of (S)-2 led to a relatively low conversion of the diketone, even after prolonged heating. However, the isolated adduct (S,P)-3 was completely enantiomerically pure (>99% de). The reaction conditions were optimized to use 0.6 equiv of (S)-2 in acetic acid, heated at 100 °C for 18 h (Scheme 1, Step 1). The product (S,P)-3 was isolated by chromatography in a relatively low yield (30%) but with the expected diastereomeric excess (>99% de), while the residual enantioenriched diketone (M)-1 was recovered in 50% yield and 55% ee. Hydrolysis of the resulting adduct (S,P)-3 was achieved in a microwave reactor at 150 °C (Scheme 1, Step 2) and allowed for the recovery of enantiopure (P)-1, in 88% yield and >99% ee. The residual enantioenriched material from the first resolution step ((M)-1, 55% ee) was utilized in another resolution (step 3). Using the opposite enantiomer (R)-2 provided (R,M)-3 in 45% yield and >99% de, which upon hydrolysis of the adduct provided (M)-1, in comparable yield and purity (step 4). Ultimately, we achieved a 53% recovery of (P)-1 and 39% of (M)-1 in their enantiomerically pure forms, relative to their initial masses (26% and 20%, respective to the total starting amount). The absolute configuration of (M)-1 and (P)-1 was confirmed by comparing their ECD spectra with that of the parent [7]helicene. In the case of (P)-1, it was additionally confirmed by X-ray analysis (Figure S30).

Scheme 1 Resolution of rac-1

As previously mentioned, diketone 1 is an ideal precursor for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Since these heterocycles are typically electro-deficient and behave as acceptors, we can create robust donor–acceptor–donor (D-A-D) push–pull systems by strategically introducing electron-donating moieties. Thus, 1 was reacted with suitably presubstituted ortho-diamine bearing two strong donors, resulting in the formation of a D-A-D push–pull system in a single step (Scheme 2, pathway 1). The ortho-diamines used for the condensation were based on phenyl, thienyl, and naphthyl moieties and were decorated with two different donor groups–diphenylaminophenylene and bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aminophenylene. The diamines were prepared by reduction of the corresponding thiadiaza- or nitro- species, respectively, and were used without further purification (for details see ESI, Schemes S4–S6). Heating the corresponding diamines with diketone 1 in acetic acid provided the products in yields ranging from 50% to 90% (Scheme 2, pathway 1). The same procedures were employed to prepare the enantiomers of the push–pull systems, starting from (P)-1 and (M)-1, respectively, providing the products in comparable yields. Further practical improvement of the method was demonstrated when 3 was hydrolyzed in the presence of the corresponding diamine (Scheme 2, pathway 2). Under these conditions, the intermediate diketone 1 was directly transformed into the desired push–pull system. This approach reduced the number of steps by one and decreased the need for purification while increasing the overall yield. For instance, compound 5b was prepared from 3 in a single step with an 84% yield, marking a 19% increase over the conventional step-by-step approach (Scheme 2, pathway 2). For comparative analysis and understanding of the influence of the triarylamine groups, we also synthesized three reference compounds, 4a–6a. These compounds lack the triarylamine units, and their synthesis was achieved in their racemic forms. Their properties provided a basis to elucidate the distinct attributes introduced by the D-A-D system in our primary compounds. The optical properties of the prepared compounds were investigated by measuring their UV/vis and fluorescence spectra (Figure 2 and S33, Table 1). As anticipated, upon the incorporation of triarylamine, a redshift in absorption was observed. This effect was notably enhanced for the methoxy-substituted series 4c–6c. A similar trend was observed for the modification of the acceptor part of the molecules—the most bathochromically shifted absorption maxima for both phenazines 4b and 4c were found at 487 and 507 nm, respectively, while for benzophenazines 5b and 5c, the maxima are located at 533 and 566 nm, respectively. The incorporation of a thiophene ring, as seen in 6b and 6c, induced a large bathochromic shift with absorbance peaks at 663 and 703 nm, both extending into the NIR wavelengths. Compounds 5a–c and 6b,c respectively exhibited minimal emission intensity, unlike 4a–c, which exhibited a relatively intensive fluorescence maxima at 477, 645, and 699, respectively (Figure S33). Also, the unsubstituted derivative 6a exhibits transitions resulting in a broadband (white) fluorescence upon excitation at 380 nm, with three intensive emission peaks located at 453, 481, and 566 nm. This feature is lost, however, with the introduction of the donors as described above. Compound 4b was found to have the largest fluorescence quantum yield of the series (0.235, Table 1), while the other compounds had quantum yields typically below 0.10. The methoxy substituted compounds 4c, 5c and 6c, as well as the series with thienyl core were particularly poor emitters, displaying quantum yields lower than 0.01. Additionally, the circular dichroism spectra (CD) of the enantiomerically pure versions of the prepared compounds were measured. In all cases, the respective enantiomers provided a mirror image of each other. The calculated gabs values were all in the typical range of 10–3, reaching up to 3 × 10–3 (for details see ESI, Figure S34–S41). Interestingly, the charge-transfer band in all compounds was completely silent in CD spectra, indicating that there is no chirality transfer from helicene to the push–pull part of the molecule. This was confirmed by the DFT calculations performed on the optimized structures (Figure 3). The HOMO is predominantly located on the triarylaminedonors, while the LUMO is mainly situated on the acceptor part of the molecule, with only a small overlap with the helicene itself. Consequently, the CD response is primarily observed in the higher energy electronic transitions, where orbitals located on the helicene participate. The calculations also support the general trends observed experimentally. The introduction of the triarylamine donor increases the HOMO levels significantly, from −5.47 eV in the case of 4a to −4.80 eV in the case of 4b (see section 4.2 in the ESI). Further increase is achieved by introduction of methoxy groups in 4c (−4.47 eV). On the other hand, the changes in LUMO levels are relatively small and all compounds are in the range from −2.54 eV to −2.12 eV. This behavior results in a gradual decrease in the HOMO–LUMO energy gap in the series which is overestimated by the DFT calculation (B3LYP/6-31G(d) level) by approximately 0.2–0.4 eV (vs Egopt). Among the series of compounds, 4a–c showed the largest HOMO–LUMO energy gap. The π-extended series 5a–c had relatively lower LUMO levels while maintaining HOMO energy at similar values compared to the series of compounds 4a–c, and, finally, the series 6a–c exhibited even lower energy gaps due to an increase of HOMO levels, compared to the two previous series.

Conclusions

In this work, we developed a methodology to separate the enantiomers of 9,10-diketo[7]helicene (1) via diastereomer formation using binaphthalene diamine derivatives. The diimine adduct 3 was formed exclusively as (S,P)-, or (R,M)-pairs (>99% de), and its subsequent hydrolysis then provided the enantiomers of 1 in high enantiomeric purity and moderate yield. The adaptability of diketone 1 in forming complex helicene-based architectures was demonstrated by developing a range of push–pull systems, integrating aza-heterocycles as acceptors and diarylaminophenylene as donors. This one-step transformation was found to have a significant impact on the optical properties of the resulting helicenes, as evidenced by UV/vis, fluorescence, and circular dichroism measurements, as well as DFT calculations. The work addresses both the longstanding issue of enantiomeric separation of some helicene derivatives and introduces an easily accessible, enantiomerically pure synthon for functionalizing helicenes, setting the stage for their broader application in advanced materials and devices.

Experimental Section

Materials and Methods

Commercially available reagent grade materials were used as obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, Apollo Scientific, and Fluorochem. (R)-(+)- and (S)-(−)-1,1′-Binaphthyl-2,2′-diamine (2), 4,7-dibromo-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (7), 4-(diphenylamino)phenylboronic acid (10b), and 4-methoxy-N-(4-metho-xyphenyl)-N-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)aniline (10c) were purchased from Fluorochem. Precursors 4,9-Dibromonaphtho[2,3-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (8)1 and 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dinitrothiophene (9)2 were prepared according to the published procedures. Model compounds (rac)-diphenanthro[3,4-a:4′,3′-c]phenazine (4a) and (rac)-benzo[i]diphenanthro[3,4-a:4′,3′-c]phenazine (5a) were prepared by our previously published procedure.3 All solvents were of a reagent grade and used without any further purification, except for tetrahydrofuran and toluene, which were freshly distilled from sodium/benzophenone, and dichloromethane, which was freshly distilled from calcium hydride. Melting points were determined with Santiago KB T300 melting point apparatus (Czech Republic) and are uncorrected. TLC was carried out using silica gel 60 F254-coated aluminum sheets, and compounds were visualized with UV light (254 and 366 nm). Column chromatography was performed using Biotage HPFC systems (Isolera One) with prepacked flash silica gel columns. Microwave experiments were performed in a sealed vial (10 mL, borosilicate glass) on synthesis reactor Monowave 300 (Anton Paar GmbH) equipped with simultaneous temperature measurement using IR and a fiber optic sensor. Specific optical rotations ([α]D20) were measured at 589 and 880 nm in DCM at 20 °C on a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter with a Peltier cell holder and 1 dm path length cell. The values are given in deg cm3 g–1 dm–1 as an average value from 50 measurements. The standard Schlenk technique was used for all reactions. 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker Avance spectrometer at 400 MHz (1H NMR) and 101 MHz (13C NMR). Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) and referenced to residuals of CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 and 77.00 ppm, respectively), CD2Cl2 (δ = 5.30 and 54.00 ppm, respectively) or DMSO-d6 (δ = 2.50 and 39.52 ppm, respectively). The coupling constants (J) are given in hertz (Hz) and the corresponding multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet). For exact mass measurement, the spectra were internally calibrated using Na-formate or APCI-TOF tuning mix. APCI high-resolution mass spectra were measured in a positive mode using a micrOTOF QIII mass spectrometer (Bruker) and were determined by software Compass Data Analysis. Absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured in a quartz cuvette with 1 cm optical path using a JASCO FP-8300 spectrofluorometer, UV–vis Spectrophotometer Varian CARY 50 CONC and Varian Eclipse spectrometer. The ECD and absorption spectra were measured on Jasco 1500 spectropolarimeter. The ECD and absorption spectra were measured over a spectral range of 220 to 600 and 800 nm respectively in DCM (1.0 × 10–4 M). Measurements were made in a quartz cell with a 0.2 cm path length using a scanning speed of 20 nm/min, a response time of 4 s, and standard instrument sensitivity. After a baseline correction, spectra were expressed in terms of differential molar extinction (Δε) and molar extinction (ε), respectively.
