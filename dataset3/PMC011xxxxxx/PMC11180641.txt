pmcIntroduction and Results

The aim of spectral geometry is to obtain deep insights into both topology and geometry of Riemannian manifolds from the spectrum of differential operators. However, in the case of an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, it is in general not possible to explicitly calculate the spectrum of a given differential operator. For this reason, it is very important to obtain characterizations of the eigenvalues of such operators in terms of geometric data as for example curvature.

The most prominent spectral problem one can study is the case of the Laplace operator acting on functions for which we recall several important results. Let Ω⊂M be a bounded domain of a Riemannian manifold M with smooth boundary ∂Ω and let λ be an eigenvalue of the Dirichlet problem1.1 Δu=λuonΩu=0on∂Ω

where u∈C∞(M) and Δ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator. From general spectral theory, we know that the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem (1.1) is discrete and that the eigenvalues satisfy0<λ1≤λ2≤λ3≤…≤λj≤…→∞.

In the case that the manifold M is the Euclidean space with the flat metric (Rn,can), Payne, Pólya and Weinberger [29, 30] derived the following so-called universal inequalities for the Dirichlet problem of the Laplace operator (1.1). Namely, they show that for any integer k≥11.2 λk+1-λk≤4nk∑i=1kλi.

An immediate consequence of (1.2) is the following inequality,λk+1≤1+4nλk,

which allows to get an estimate of all the eigenvalues if an upper bound is known on the lowest one λ1. Another kind of such inequality has been further developed by Hile and Protter (see [19]) and by Yang in [40] who established the following estimate1.3 ∑i=1k(λk+1-λi)2≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1-λi)λi.

This inequality improves all the previous estimates. In [11], Cheng and Yang were able to turn the recursion formula (1.3) into an estimate for the (k+1)-th eigenvalue of (1.1) in terms of some power of k as follows1.4 λk+1≤C0(n,k)k2nλ1,

where C0(n,k) is a constant only depending on n and k. For more details on the spectral properties of the Dirichlet problem (1.1) we refer to the lecture notes [2].

Many of these formulas have been generalized to the case of a Riemannian manifold. In this setup, Chen and Cheng [9] obtained an extrinsic estimate for eigenvalues of the Dirichlet problem (1.1) of the Laplacian on a complete Riemannian manifold (Mn,g) that is isometrically immersed in an (n+m)-dimensional Euclidean space Rn+m (see also [14]). The estimate is1.5 ∑i=1k(λk+1-λi)2≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1-λi)λi+n24supΩ|H|2.

Here, H:=1ntrace(II) denotes the mean curvature of the immersion and II is the second fundamental form. As a consequence, they deduce an upper bound for the (k+1)-th eigenvalue in terms of a power of k that involves the mean curvature.

In this article, we focus on the study of geometric differential operators on an interesting class of Riemannian manifolds, the so-called Bakry-Emery manifolds. A Bakry-Emery manifold is a triple (M,g,dμf), where instead of the Riemannian measure dvg one considers the weighted measure dμf:=e-fdvg with f∈C∞(M). One often refers to this kind of manifolds as weighted manifolds. While the initial motivation to study such kind of manifolds was to model diffusion processes [4] they have by now become famous in the study of self-similar solutions of the Ricci flow, the so-called Ricci solitons. Also they appear in the analysis of shrinkers, which represent a special class of solutions of the mean curvature flow. We refer to [13, Section 2] and [21] for more details.

Due to the presence of the weight, differential operators on weighted manifolds contain additional contributions and also their spectrum is different compared to the case of standard Riemannian manifolds. For example, the Laplace operator acting on functions on a weighted manifold is defined as follows1.6 Δf:=Δ+∇df,

where Δ=δd is the standard Laplace-Beltrami operator. A direct computation shows that Δf, usually called drift Laplacian, is elliptic and self-adjoint (if M is compact) with respect to the weighted measure e-fdvg. Therefore, its spectrum is discrete and consists of an increasing sequence of eigenvalues0<λ1,f≤λ2,f≤⋯≤λj,f≤⋯→∞.

As in the standard case, the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to constant functions. Several results have been obtained on the spectrum of this operator (see for example [26–28]) of which we give a non-exhaustive list below. In particular, when a compact Bakry-Emery manifold (Mn,g) is isometrically immersed into the Euclidean space, Xia and Xu [39] established the following recursion formula∑i=1k(λk+1,f-λi,f)2≤1n∑i=1k(λk+1,f-λi,f)(4λi,f+4supΩ|∇f|λi,f+n2supΩ|H|2+supΩ|∇f|2))

which clearly reduces to Inequality (1.5) when f is zero. Also several explicit calculations for the drift Laplacian on self shrinkers were carried out in [6, 10, 41].

This article is devoted to the study of the Hodge Laplacian acting on differential forms on weighted manifolds, which we will often refer to as drifting Hodge Laplacian, and also denote it by Δf (see Subsection 2.2 for the definition). As for functions, the drifting Hodge Laplacian on differential p-forms has a discrete spectrum that entirely consists of nonnegative eigenvalues denoted by (λi,p,f)i. In particular, we will derive various eigenvalue estimates as well as different recursion formulas which will characterize the corresponding spectrum.

In the following, we present the main results of this article. First, we extend the results of [1, 35] to the case of weighted manifolds:

Theorem 1.1

Let (Mn,g,dμf=e-fdvg) be a compact Bakry-Emery manifold that is isometrically immersed into the Euclidean space Rn+m. For p=1,…,n, we let λ1,p,f be the first nonnegative eigenvalue of Δf on p-forms and λ1,p,f′ the first positive eigenvalue of Δf on exact p-forms. Then, we have the following estimate1.7 λ1,p,f-λ1,p-1,f≥1pinfMB[p]+Tf[p]-∑s=1m(IIs[p])2.

Also, we have the inequality1.8 λ1,p,f′≤1Volf(M)∫Mpn|H|2-p(p-1)n(n-1)ScalM+pn|df|2dμf,

where ScalM denotes the scalar curvature of M.

The tensor B[p]+Tf[p] appearing in the first statement of Theorem 1.1 is the so-called p-Ricci tensor, see (2.6) for the precise definition. Also, IIs[p] is some canonical extension of the second fundamental form II of the immersion to differential p-forms in the direction of the normal vector field νs, see (3.3) for more details.

Remark 1.2

It is well-known that λ1,f=λ1,1,f′ where λ1,f is the first positive eigenvalue of Δf on functions. Hence we get the estimate for λ1,f1.9 λ1,f≤1Volf(M)∫Mn|H|2+1n|df|2dμf,

which is the same estimate as in [7].

It was shown in [22] that when M is an embedded shrinker of revolution in R3 such that the intersection of M with some sphere has only two connected components and such that M is symmetric with respect to reflection across the axis of revolution, then equality is attained in (1.9). Therefore, the inequality in Theorem 1.1 is attained for p=1.

In addition to the eigenvalue estimates presented in Theorem 1.1, we establish the following recursion formulas for the eigenvalues of the drifting Hodge Laplacian on weighted manifolds:

Theorem 1.3

Let X:(Mn,g)→(Rn+m,can) be an isometric immersion. For any p∈{0,…,n}, the eigenvalues of the drifting Hodge Laplacian Δf acting on p-forms on a domain Ω of M with Dirichlet boundary conditions satisfy for any k≥1∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,f)α-1λi,p,f-∫Ω⟨(B[p]+Tf[p])ωi,ωi⟩dμf+n24∫Ω|H|2|ωi|2dμf-14∫Ω(2Δf+|df|2)|ωi|2dμf,

for α≤2. Also, we have∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤2αn∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α-1λi,p,f-∫Ω⟨(B[p]+Tf[p])ωi,ωi⟩dμf+n24∫Ω|H|2|ωi|2dμf-14∫Ω(2Δf+|df|2)|ωi|2dμf,

for α≥2. Here, ωi represents the i-th eigenform of Δf.

Remark 1.4

In Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.3 the tensor B[p] appears in the estimates. It is possible to express this tensor in terms of extrinsic geometric data via Eq. (4.5) but as this would further complicate the presentation of the eigenvalue estimates we do not make use of this option.

In order to eliminate the dependence on ωi in the statements of Theorem 1.3, we take the infimum over Ω of the smallest eigenvalue of the endomorphsim B[p]+Tf[p] which we denote by δ1 to deduce that

Corollary 1.5

Let X:(Mn,g)→(Rn+m,can) be an isometric immersion. For any p∈{0,…,n}, the eigenvalues of the drifting Hodge Laplacian Δf acting on p-forms on a domain Ω of M with Dirichlet boundary conditions satisfy for any k≥1∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α-1λi,p,f-δ1+14δ2

for α≤2. Also, we have∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤2αn∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α-1λi,p,f-δ1+14δ2

for α≥2. Here, we set δ2=supΩ(n2|H|2-2Δf-|df|2).

Remark 1.6

Choosing α=2 in the estimates of Corollary 1.5 generalizes the results obtained by Xia and Xu [39] for functions to the case of p-forms.

In the case of α=2 and f=|X|22 recursion formulas similar to the ones of Corollary 1.5 were established in [12].

Finally, we finish by establishing an estimate for the index of a compact f-minimal hypersurface of Rn+1 as in [21, 37]. Recall that a f-minimal hypersurface M of the weighted manifold (Rn+1,can,e-fdvg) is a hypersurface such that the f-mean curvature vanishes,nHf:=nH+∂f∂ν=0,

where H is the mean curvature. The stability operator of M, also called Jacobi operator, is then defined for any smooth function u on M byLf(u):=Δfu-(Ricfn+1(ν,ν)+|II|2)u,

where Ricfn+1 denotes the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor. On an arbitrary Riemannian manifold (N, h), the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor (or the ∞-Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor) is defined as followsRicfN=RicN+HessNf,

where HessNf is the Hessian of f on N. In the case of N=(Rn,can) we simply have that Ricfn+1=Hessn+1f and the stability operator acquires the formLf(u):=Δfu-(Hessn+1f(ν,ν)+|II|2)u.

The f-index of M is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator Lf. In order to estimate this number, we will establish an upper bound for the eigenvalues (λk(Lf))k of the Jacobi operator that depends on the eigenvalues of the drifting Hodge Laplacian Δf on p-forms. This will generalize the result obtained in [21, Theorem A] when p=1.

Theorem 1.7

Let (Mn,g) be a compact hypersurface of the weighted manifold (Rn+1,can,dμf=e-fdvg). Assume that M is f-minimal and that Ricfn+1=Hessn+1f≥a>0. We denote by k1,…,kn the principal curvatures of the hypersurface. Then, for all l≥1 and 1≤p≤n, we have thatλl(Lf)≤λd(l),p,f-(p+1)a+γMp(p-1),

where γM=sup{kikj:i≠j} andd(l)=n+1p+1(l-1)+1.

Now, if we setβ=♯{eigenvalues onp-forms ofΔfwhich are less than(p+1)a-γMp(p-1)},

we obtain the immediate two corollaries

Corollary 1.8

Let (Mn,g) be a compact hypersurface of the weighted manifold (Rn+1,can,dμf=e-fdvg). Assume that M is f-minimal and that Ricfn+1=Hessn+1f≥a>0. Then, for any 1≤p≤n, we have thatIndf(M)≥1n+1p+1β.

A particular case of Corollary 1.8 is when M is self-shrinker. Recall that a self-shrinker manifold is a compact and connected submanifold of the Euclidean space Rn+m satisfying the equation X⊥=-nH. Here X=(x1,x2,…,xn+m) are the components of the immersion into Rn+m. By taking the weight f=|X|22, one can easily check that any self-shrinker hypersurface is automatically f-minimal and that Hessn+1f=can. Therefore,

Corollary 1.9

Let (Mn,g)→Rn+1 be a compact self-shrinker such that p(p-1)γM≤p+1 for some 1≤p≤n. Then, we haveIndf(M)≥1n+1p+1bp(M)+n+1,

for the weight f=|X|22.

Remark 1.10

We would like to point out that Theorem 1.7 allows to obtain a statement on the stability of f-minimal hypersurfaces in terms of its p-th Betti number which was only known for p=1 so far. However, the drawback is the fact that the stability estimate also depends on the curvature of the hypersurface which is not the case for p=1.

This article is organized as follows: In Sect. 2 we present a number of general features on Dirac and Laplace type operators on weighted manifolds. Section 3 provides the proofs of the main results while Sect. 4 is devoted to a number of geometric applications. Throughout this article, we will use the geometers sign convention for the Laplacian.

When finalizing this manuscript, the article “Spinors and mass on weighted manifolds” [5] appeared, where most of the results presented in Subsection 2.1 have been obtained independently from our calculations.

Dirac and Laplace Type Operators on Weighted Manifolds

The Dirac Operator on Weighted Manifolds

In this section, we study the question of defining the fundamental Dirac operator on a weighted Riemannian spin manifold. In the famous article of Perelman [33, Remark 1.3] some results in this direction were already presented.

In particular, this will allow to get a new vanishing result on the kernel of the Dirac operator based on the scalar curvature of weighted manifolds, see also [33, Remark 1.3].

In order to approach this question, we first recall some basic facts on spin manifolds [23]. Let (Mn,g) be a Riemannian spin manifold of dimension n. The spinor bundle ΣM is a vector bundle over the manifold M that is equipped with a metric connection ∇ and a Hermitian scalar product ⟨·,·⟩. On this bundle we have the Clifford multiplication of spinors with tangent vectors which we denote by the symbol ``·”. Remember that Clifford multiplication is compatible with the connection on the spinor bundle. Moreover, it is skew-symmetric in the sense⟨Y·ψ,φ⟩=-⟨ψ,Y·φ⟩

for all Y∈TM and ψ,φ∈Γ(ΣM). The fundamental Dirac operator D:Γ(ΣM)→Γ(ΣM) acting on spinors is defined byD:=∑i=1nei·∇ei,

where {ei}i=1,…,n is an orthonormal basis of TM. The Dirac operator is an elliptic, first order differential operator which is self-adjoint with respect to the L2-norm (when M is compact). Therefore, it admits a sequence of eigenvalues of finite multiplicities. Also, its square is related to the Laplacian through the so-called Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula which is given by [23]2.1 D2=∇∗∇+14ScalM,

where ∇∗∇=-∑i=1n∇ei∇ei+∑i=1n∇∇eiei and ScalM is the scalar curvature of the manifold M. Let us now consider a smooth real valued function f on M and the weighted measure dμf:=e-fdvg. In order to define the Dirac operator on a compact weighted manifold, we use the following variational principle. The standard Dirac action with a weighted measure is2.2 E(ψ):=∫M⟨ψ,Dψ⟩dμf,

where ψ∈Γ(ΣM).

Proposition 2.1

The critical points of (2.2) are characterized by the equation2.3 Dψ-12df·ψ=0.

Proof

We consider a variation of the spinor ψ defined as ψt:(-ε,ε)×M→ΣM satisfying ∇ψt∂t|t=0=φ and we calculateddt|t=0E(ψt)=∫M(⟨φ,Dψ⟩+⟨ψ,Dφ⟩)dμf=∫M(⟨φ,Dψ⟩+⟨Dψ,φ⟩-⟨df·ψ,φ⟩)dμf=∫M(Re⟨(2D-df·)ψ,φ⟩dμf.

Therefore, the critical points of the energy E are exactly solutions of Eq. (2.2). This completes the proof. □

Motivated by the above calculation, we define

Definition 2.2

The fundamental Dirac operator on a Bakry-Emery manifold (Mn,g,dμf) is given by2.4 Df:=D-12df·

Proposition 2.3

The operator Df is elliptic. Moreover, if M is compact, it is self-adjoint with respect to the L2-norm.

Proof

It is straightforward to check that D and Df have the same principal symbol, hence Df is clearly elliptic. To prove the second part, we choose two spinors ψ,φ and calculate∫M⟨Dfψ,φ⟩e-fdvg=∫M⟨Dψ,φ⟩e-fdvg-12∫M⟨df·ψ,φ⟩e-fdvg=∫M⟨ψ,D(e-fφ)⟩dvg-12∫M⟨df·ψ,φ⟩e-fdvg=∫M⟨ψ,Dφ⟩e-fdvg-∫M⟨ψ,df·φ⟩e-fdvg+12∫M⟨ψ,df·φ⟩e-fdvg=∫M〈ψ,Dφ-12df·φ〉e-fdvg=∫M⟨ψ,Dfφ⟩e-fdvg.

The proof is complete. □

Remark 2.4

It is straightforward to check that (2.2) is invariant under conformal transformations of the metric on M. Hence, we cannot expect that we can relate the properties of D and Df by conformally transforming the metric on M.

However, the spectral properties of Df are essentially the same as the ones of the standard Dirac operator D as is shown by the following proposition.

Proposition 2.5

On a Bakry-Emery manifold (Mn,g,dμf), we haveDf(ef/2)=ef/2D.

In particular, if ψ is an eigenspinor of D associated with the eigenvalue λ, then ef/2ψ is an eigenspinor of Df associated with the same eigenvalue λ.

Proof

By a straightforward calculation, we have for any spinor field ψDf(ef/2ψ)=D(ef/2ψ)-12ef/2df·ψ=ef/2Dψ+12ef/2df·ψ-12ef/2df·ψ=ef/2Dψ.

□

In order to obtain a corresponding Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula for Df we make the following observation: The L2-adjoint of ∇ with respect to the weighted measure e-fdvg will be denoted by ∇f∗ and is given by the following expression∇f∗=∇∗+∇df.

Hence, we have

Proposition 2.6

The square Df2 satisfies the following formula:2.5 Df2=∇f∗∇+14ScalM-12Δf-14|df|2.

Proof

A direct calculation showsDf2=D-12df·D-12df·=D2-12D(df·)-12df·D+14df·df·=D2-12(δdf-df·D-2∇df)-12df·D+14df·df·=D2-12Δf+∇df-14|df|2.

Combining with (2.1) and using the definition of ∇f∗ completes the proof. □

As in the case of the fundamental Dirac operator on Riemannian spin manifolds [24], we deduce the following vanishing result

Corollary 2.7

Let (M,g,dμf) be a closed Bakry-Emery manifold. If ScalM>2Δf+|df|2, then kerD=0.

Proof

This follows directly from Proposition 2.6 and the invariance of the spectrum of the Dirac operator in Proposition 2.5. □

Remark 2.8

Suppose that (M, g) is a closed Riemannian surface. If we integrate the condition ScalM>2Δf+|df|2 with respect to the standard Riemannian measure dvg, we get2πχ(M)-∫M|df|2dvg>0,

where χ(M) represents the Euler characteristic of the surface. Hence, this inequality can only be satisfied on a surface of positive Euler characteristic.

The Bochner-Laplacian on Weighted Manifolds

In this section, we will recall the Hodge Laplacian on weighted manifolds and define a twisted Laplacian motivated from the expression of the Dirac operator in the previous section. This will also allow to get a new vanishing result on the cohomology groups of the manifold.

For this, let (Mn,g,dμf=e-fdvg) be a Riemannian Bakry-Emery manifold. We denote by d the exterior differential and by δ the codifferential. The weighted codifferential is defined by δf:=δ+df⌟ where we identify here (and in all the paper) vectors with one-forms through the musical isomorphism. The weighted codifferential is the L2-formal adjoint of d with respect to the measure dμf, when M is compact. By a straightforward computation, one shows thatδf2=δ(δ+df⌟)+df⌟(δ+df⌟)=δ(df⌟)+df⌟δ=0,

where we use the fact δ(df⌟)=-df⌟δ, since HessMf=∇df is a symmetric endomorphism. The drifting Hodge Laplacian on differential forms is then defined asΔf:=dδf+δfd.

Clearly, the drifting Hodge Laplacian commutes with d and δf and, therefore, it preserves the spaces of exact and weighted coexact forms. Moreover, this operator is elliptic and, when M is compact, it is self-adjoint with respect to the weighted measure dμf. Therefore, as for the ordinary Hodge Laplacian on compact manifolds, the drifting Hodge Laplacian restricted to differential p-forms (1≤p≤n) has a spectrum that consists of a nondecreasing, unbounded sequence of eigenvalues with finite multiplicities, that isSpec(Δf)={0≤λ1,p,f≤λ2,p,f≤…}.

The eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the space of f-harmonic forms, that is differential forms ω satisfying dω=0 and δfω=0. Notice that, by standard elliptic theory, we have an isomorphism [25, Formula 2.13],Hp(M)≃{ω∈Ωp(M)|dω=0,δfω=0},

meaning that the f-Betti numbers do not depend on f. Now it is shown in [32], that the drifting Hodge Laplacian Δf has a corresponding Bochner-Weitzenböck formula which is2.6 Δf=∇f∗∇+B[p]+Tf[p]

where B[p]=∑i,j=1nej∗∧ei⌟RM(ei,ej) is the Bochner operator that appears in the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula for Δ=dδ+δd. Here, RM(X,Y):=[∇X,∇Y]-∇[X,Y] is the curvature tensor operator of M for X,Y∈TM and Tf[p] is the self-adjoint endomorphism of Λp(M) given by2.7 (Tf[p]ω)(X1,…,Xp)=∑k=1pω(X1,…,∇2f(Xk),…,Xp)

for all X1,…,Xp∈TM and {e1,…,en} is a local orthonormal frame of TM. The tensor B[p]+Tf[p] is called the p-Ricci tensor and is denoted by Ricf(p) (see [34]). For p=1, the p-Ricci tensor is just Ricf(1)=RicM+HessMf which is the ∞-Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor. Also, for any N∈]-∞,0[∪]n-p+1,∞[, we letRicN,f(p):=Ricf(p)-1N-(n-p+1)(df∧(df⌟))

which corresponds to the so-called N-Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor for p=1. It is now a well-known fact that the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula gives rise to the Gallot-Meyer estimate on manifolds having a lower bound on the Bochner operator B[p] [15]. In the following, we will adapt this technique to give an estimate for the eigenvalues of the drifting Hodge Laplacian on a Bakry-Emery manifold having a lower bound on RicN,f(p). For this, we denote by λ1,p,f′ the first positive eigenvalue of Δf restricted to exact p-forms. Then, we have

Proposition 2.9

Let (Mn,g,dμf) be a compact Bakry-Emery manifold. If RicN,f(p)≥p(n-p)γ for some γ>0, then the first eigenvalue λ1,p,f′ satisfies the estimateλ1,p,f′≥p(n-p)γNN-1.

Proof

Let ω be any exact p-eigenform. Applying the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula (2.6) yieldsλ1,p,f′∫M|ω|2dμf=∫M|∇ω|2dμf+∫M⟨(B[p]+Tf[p])ω,ω⟩dμf.

Now, using that |∇ω|2≥1n-p+1|δω|2 as ω is closed [15], we have that|∇ω|2≥1n-p+1|δfω-df⌟ω|2≥1n-p+1(|δfω|-|df⌟ω|)2≥1N|δfω|2-1N-(n-p+1)|df⌟ω|2.

Here, we use the inequality (p+q)2s≥p2N-q2N-s for all N such that we have N(N-s)>0. Therefore, by integrating over M and using the fact λ1,p,f′∫M|ω|2dμf=∫M|δfω|2dμf, we get the estimate. □

In the last part of this section, we will define a new drifting Hodge Laplacian acting on differential p-forms that will allow us to get a new vanishing result on the cohomology groups. For this, recall that the weighted Dirac operator defined in the previous section is Df=∑i=1nei·∇ei-12df·. When restricted to differential forms, the operator Df can be written asDf=∑i=1nei∧∇ei-ei⌟∇ei-12df∧+12df⌟=d~f+δ~f,

where d~f:=d-12df∧ and δ~f:=δ+12df⌟. Here, we use the fact that X·ω=X∧ω-X⌟ω for any vector field X and a differential form ω. It is not difficult to check that d~f2=δ~f2=0 and that δ~f=δf-12df⌟ is the L2-adjoint of d~f with respect to the measure dμf=e-fdvg. Also the square of the Dirac operator gives rise to the twisted LaplacianDf2=Δ~f:=d~fδ~f+δ~fd~f

that has the same spectrum as Δ by Proposition 2.5. Now, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenböck formula for Δ~f in order to get a new vanishing result for the cohomology groups.

Proposition 2.10

Let (M,g,dμf) be a Bakry-Emery manifold. Then, we have the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula for the twisted drifting Hodge Laplacian2.8 Δ~f=∇f∗∇+B[p]-12Δf-14|df|2.

In particular, if M is compact and B[p]>12Δf+14|df|2 for some p, then Hp(M)=0.

Proof

We computeΔ~f=d~fδ~f+δ~fd~f=d-12df∧δf-12df⌟+δf-12df⌟d-12df∧=Δf-12d(df⌟)-12df∧δf+14df∧(df⌟)-12δf(df∧)-12df⌟d+14df⌟(df∧)=Δf-12Ldf-12df∧δf-12δf(df∧)+14|df|2=Δf-12∇df-12Tf[p]-12df∧δf-12δf(df∧)+14|df|2.

In the last equality, we used the identity [36, Lem. 2.1]Ldf=∇df+Tf[p].

Now, an easy computation shows thatδf(df∧)=Δf+∑i=1n∇eidf∧(ei⌟)-∇df+|df|2-df∧δf.

Using the fact that Tf[p]=∑i=1n∇eidf∧(ei⌟) which can be proven by a straightforward computation, we get after using Eq. (2.6) and replacing the last equality,Δ~f=∇f∗∇+B[p]+Tf[p]-12∇df-12Tf[p]-12df∧δf-12Δf+Tf[p]-∇df+|df|2-df∧δf+14|df|2=∇f∗∇+B[p]-12Δf-14|df|2.

Note that (2.8) has the same structure as the corresponding Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula for the Dirac operator on weighted manifolds (2.5). The vanishing result on the cohomology is obtained by just applying (2.8) to a Δ~f-harmonic form and integrating over M. Finally, the fact that the set of Δ~f-harmonic form is isomorphic to Hp(M) allows to finish the proof. □

Proofs of the Main Results

In this section, we provide the proofs of the main results.

Proof of Theorem 1.1

We start by proving the first part of the theorem. We assume that (Mn,g,dμf=e-fdvg) is a compact Bakry-Emery manifold that is isometrically immersed into Rn+m. For p=1,…,n, we let λ1,p,f the first nonegative eigenvalue of Δf on p-forms and λ1,p,f′ the first positive eigenvalue of Δf on exact p-forms. For every i=1,…,n+m, the parallel unit vector field ∂xi decomposes into ∂xi=(∂xi)T+(∂xi)⊥ with (∂xi)T=d(xi∘ι) where ι is the isometric immersion. Now, take any p-eigenform ω of Δf and consider the (p-1)-form ϕi:=(∂xi)T⌟ω for each i=1,…,n+m. By the Rayleigh min-max principle, we have that3.1 λ1,p-1,f∑i=1n+m∫M|ϕi|2dμf≤∑i=1n+m∫M(|dϕi|2+|δfϕi|2)dμf.

In the following, we will adapt some computations done in [16] to the context of the drifting Hodge Laplacian (see also [1], [8, Thm. 5.8] for a similar computation). Denoting by {e1,…,en} a local orthonormal frame of TM we find that3.2 ∑i=1n+m|ϕi|2=∑s,t=1n∑i=1n+mg((∂xi)T,es)g((∂xi)T,et)⏟δst⟨es⌟ω,et⌟ω⟩=∑s=1n|es⌟ω|2=p|ω|2.

Here, we use the fact that α=1p∑s=1nes∗∧es⌟α, for any p-form α. Moreover, by using the Cartan formula and [16, Eq. (4.3)], we writedϕi=L(∂xi)Tω-(∂xi)T⌟dω=∇(∂xi)Tω+II(∂xi)⊥[p]ω-(∂xi)T⌟dω,

where IIZ[p] is the canonical extension of the second fundamental form II of the immersion to differential p-forms in the normal direction Z. More precisely, if we write ⟨IIZ(X),Y⟩=⟨II(X,Y),Z⟩ for any tangent vector fields X,Y∈TM and Z∈T⊥M, we define3.3 (IIZ[p]ω)(X1,…,Xp):=∑i=1pω(X1,…,IIZ(Xi),…,Xp)

for any differential p-form ω on M and X1,…,Xp∈TM. Now, as we did in (3.1), we decompose (∂xi)T and (∂xi)⊥ in the frames {e1,…,en} and {ν1,…,νm} to compute the norm square of dϕi, we deduce after summing over i that3.4 ∑i=1n+m|dϕi|2=|∇ω|2+∑s=1m|IIs[p]ω|2+(p+1)|dω|2-2∑i=1n⟨∇eiω,ei⌟dω⟩=|∇ω|2+∑s=1m|IIs[p]ω|2+(p-1)|dω|2.

Here, {ν1,…,νm} is a local orthonormal frame of T⊥M. In the above computation, we use the fact that all cross terms involving (∂xi)T and (∂xi)⊥ are zero. By writing δfϕi=δϕi+df⌟ϕi with δϕi=-(∂xi)T⌟δω which is a consequence from the fact that ∇(∂xi)T=HessM(xi∘ι) is a symmetric endomorphism, we get that3.5 ∑i=1n+m|δfϕi|2=(p-1)|δω|2+(p-1)|df⌟ω|2-2∑i=1n+m⟨(∂xi)T⌟δω,df⌟(∂xi)T⌟ω⟩=(p-1)|δω|2+(p-1)|df⌟ω|2-2∑i=1n⟨ei⌟δω,df⌟ei⌟ω⟩=(p-1)|δω|2+(p-1)|df⌟ω|2+2(p-1)⟨δω,df⌟ω⟩=(p-1)|δfω|2.

Replacing Equalities (3.2), (3.4) and (3.5) into Inequality (3.1), we deduce after using the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula (2.6) thatpλ1,p-1,f∫M|ω|2dμf≤∫M(|∇ω|2+∑s=1m|IIs[p]ω|2+(p-1)|dω|2+(p-1)|δfω|2)dμf=∫M(⟨Δfω,ω|〉-〈(B[p]+Tf[p])ω,ω〉+∑s=1m|IIs[p]ω|2)dμf+(p-1)λ1,p,f∫M|ω|2dμf=pλ1,p,f∫M|ω|2dμf+∫M〈∑s=1m(IIs[p])2-B[p]-Tf[p]ω,ω〉dμf.

This finishes the proof of the first part. To prove the second part of Theorem 1.1, we use the same technique as in [35] and adapt it to the case of the drifting Hodge Laplacian. We consider the exact p-form(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T,

for ik=1,…,n+m,k=1,…,p. By applying the min-max principle and summing over i1,…,ip, we get3.6 λ1,p,f′∑i1,…,ip∫M|(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2dμf≤∑i1,…,ip∫M|δf(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2dμf.

Now, we manipulate both sums the same way as in [35]. The sum on the left hand side of (3.6) is equal to p!np (see [35, Lemma 2.1] for more details). To confirm this fact, we denote as usual by {e1,…,en} a local orthonormal frame of TM and calculate∑i1,…,ip|(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=∑i1,…,ip⟨(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T,(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T⟩=∑i1,…,ip,s,tg((∂xi1)T,es)g((∂xi1)T,et)×⟨es∧…∧(∂xip)T,et∧…∧(∂xip)T⟩=∑i2,…,ip,s,tδst⟨es∧(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T,et∧(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T⟩=∑i2,…,ip,s|es∧(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=(n-p+1)∑i2,…,ip|(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2.

In the last line, we use the fact that, for any p-form ω, the equality ∑s=1n|es∧ω|2=(n-p)|ω|2 holds true. Hence, by induction, we deduce that3.7 ∑i1,…,ip|(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=(n-p+1)(n-p+2)…n=p!np.

Now, we aim to compute the sum on the right hand side of (3.6). To this end we recall some computations done in [35]. First, by [35, Eq. 3.3],δ(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T=∑s=1p(-1)s+1T⊥[p-1]((∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xis)T^∧…∧(∂xip)T)

where, on differential q-forms, the operator Tν[q] is defined asTν[q]:=IIν[q]-n⟨H,ν⟩I

for any normal vector field ν. Here, IIν[q] is the canonical extension of the second fundamental form as defined previously in (3.3). For any basis of orthonormal vector fields {ν1,…,νm}∈TxM⊥, we set||II[q]||2=∑s=1m||IIνs[q]||2and||T[q]||2=∑s=1m||Tνs[q]||2.

It was shown in [35, p. 592] that3.8 ∑i1,…,ip|δ(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=p!||T[p-1]||2

and the latter can be computed explicitly in terms of |II|2 and the scalar curvature of M through the formula (see [35, Lemma 2.5])||T[p-1]||2=nppn|H|2-p(p-1)n(n-1)ScalM.

Therefore, we compute3.9 |δf(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=|δ(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2+|df⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2+2〈δ(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T,df⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T〉.

First, we show that the mixed term in (3.9) vanishes. For this, we write〈δ(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T,df⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T〉=∑s=1p(-1)s+1〈T⊥[p-1]((∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xis)T^∧…∧(∂xip)T),df⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T〉=∑s=1p(-1)s+1g((∂xis)⊥,να)g((∂xis)T,eβ)×〈Tα[p-1]((∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xis)T^∧…∧(∂xip)T),df⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧eβ∧…∧(∂xip)T〉=∑s=1p(-1)s+1g(∂xis,να)g(∂xis,eβ)×〈Tα[p-1]((∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xis)T^∧…∧(∂xip)T),df⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧eβ∧…∧(∂xip)T〉.

Hence, summing over i1,…,ip, we deduce that∑i1,…,ip⟨δ(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T,df⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T⟩=0.

Now, it remains to compute the sum over i1,…,ip of the second term in (3.9). We establish the following lemma:

Lemma 3.1

For any vector field X∈TM, we have∑i1,…,ip|X⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=p!n-1p-1|X|2.

Proof

Using the formula X⌟(α∧ω)=g(X,α♯)ω-α∧X⌟ω, which is valid for any one-form α, we writeX⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T=g(X,(∂xi1)T)(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T-(∂xi1)T∧X⌟((∂xi2)T…∧(∂xip)T).

Taking the norm and summing over i1,…,ip, we get that∑i1,…,ip|X⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=∑i1,…,ipg(X,(∂xi1)T)2|(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2+∑i1,…,ip|(∂xi1)T∧X⌟((∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T)|2-2∑i1,…,ipg(X,(∂xi1)T)〈(∂xi1)T⌟(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T,X⌟((∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T)〉.

Using the fact that ∑i=1n+mg(X,(∂xi)T)2=|X|2 and Eq. (3.7), the first sum in the above equation is equal to (p-1)!np-1|X|2. Concerning the second sum, we make use of the identity ∑i=1n+m|(∂xi)T∧ω|2=(n-p)|ω|2, and deduce that the second sum is equal to(n-p+2)∑i2,…,ip|X⌟(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2.

After using X=∑i=1n+mg(X,(∂xi)T)(∂xi)T, the last sum reduces to-2∑i2,…,ip|X⌟(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2.

Here, we conclude that∑i1,…,ip|X⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=(p-1)!np-1|X|2+(n-p)∑i2,…,ip|X⌟(∂xi2)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2.

Thus, by induction, we deduce that3.10 ∑i1,…,ip|X⌟(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=|X|2(p-1)!np-1+(n-p)(p-2)!np-2+(n-p)(n-p+1)(p-3)!np-3+….

After some algebraic manipulations, Equality (3.10) reduces to the following|X|2n!(n-p-1)!∑k=0p-11(n-p+k)(n-p+k+1)=|X|2n!(n-p-1)!∑k=0p-11n-p+k-1n-p+k+1=|X|2n!(n-p-1)!pn(n-p)=p!n-1p-1|X|2.

This finishes the proof of the Lemma. □

Using Lemma 3.1 with X=df and Equation (3.8), we deduce that the sum over i1,…,ip of Eq. (3.9) gives the following∑i1,…,ip|δf(∂xi1)T∧…∧(∂xip)T|2=p!||T[p-1]||2+p!n-1p-1|df|2.

Hence, by plugging Eq. (3.7) into Inequality (3.6) we get the estimateλ1,p,f′≤1Volf(M)∫Mpn|H|2-p(p-1)n(n-1)ScalM+pn|df|2dμf

completing the proof of Theorem 1.1. □

Before we turn to the proof of Theorem 1.3, we recall the following powerful results from [3] in which the authors show the following:

Theorem 3.2

[3, Thm. 2]. Let H be a complex Hilbert space with a given inner product ⟨·,·⟩. Let A:D⊂H→H be a self-adjoint operator defined on a dense domain D which is semi-bounded below and has a discrete spectrum λ1≤λ2≤λ3…. Let {Bk:A(D)→H}k=1N be a collection of symmetric operators which leave D invariant and let {ui}i=1∞ be the normalized eigenvectors of A, ui corresponding to λi. This family is assumed to be an orthonormal basis of H. Let g be a nonnegative and nondecreasing function of the eigenvalues {λi}i=1m. Then we have the inequality∑i=1m∑k=1N(λm+1-λi)2g(λi)⟨[A,Bk]ui,Bkui⟩≤∑i=1m∑k=1N(λm+1-λi)g(λi)||[A,Bk]ui||2.

Here [A,B]:=AB-BA is the commutator of the two operators A and B.

As a corollary of this result and by taking g(λ)=(λm+1-λ)α-2 for α≤2, we get the following inequality [3, Cor. 3]3.11 ∑i=1m∑k=1N(λm+1-λi)α⟨[A,Bk]ui,Bkui⟩≤∑i=1m∑k=1N(λm+1-λi)α-1||[A,Bk]ui||2.

In the same paper, the authors deal with another type of inequalities treated by Harell and Stubbe [17]. For this, we say that a real function f satisfies condition (H1) if there exists a function r(x) such thatf(x)-f(y)x-y≥r(x)+r(y)2(H1).

An example of such a function f is whenever f′ is concave, in this case r=f′. In [3], Ashbaugh and Hermi prove the following:

Theorem 3.3

[3, Thm. 7]. Under the same assumptions as in the previous theorem, and if f is a function satisfying the condition (H1), we have∑i=1mf(λi)∑k=1N⟨[A,Bk]ui,Bkui⟩≤-12∑i=1mr(λi)∑k=1N||[A,Bk]ui||2+R,

whereR=∑k=1N∑i=1m∑j=m+1∞|⟨[A,Bk]ui,uj⟩|2f(λi)λm+1-λi+12r(λi).

For the particular case, when f(λ)=(λm+1-λ)α with α≥2, they deduce the following inequality [3, Cor. 8]3.12 ∑i=1m∑k=1N(λm+1-λi)α⟨[A,Bk]ui,Bkui⟩≤α2∑i=1m∑k=1N(λm+1-λi)α-1||[A,Bk]ui||2.

Proof of Theorem 1.3

In the following we will use Inequalities (3.11) and (3.12) in the case of the drifting Hodge Laplacian defined on a manifold with boundary. Recall that on a compact Riemannian manifold (Ω,g) with boundary ∂Ω the Dirichlet problem on differential p-forms is given by3.13 Δfω=λp,fωonΩω=0on∂Ω.

We now take A=Δf and Bk a function on Ω, which we will denote by G, in Inequalities (3.11) and (3.12). We follow closely the computations done in [20]. Throughout the proof we choose an orthonormal frame {ei}i=1,…,n of TM such that ∇ei=0 at a fixed point. First, using Eq. (2.6), we compute[Δf,G]ω=[∇f∗∇,G]ω=-∑i=1n∇ei∇ei+∇df(Gω)-G∇f∗∇ω=(ΔfG)ω-2∇dGω.

Here, we recall that ΔfG=ΔG+g(df,dG). Therefore, we get that3.14 ∫Ω⟨[Δf,G]ω,Gω⟩dμf=∫ΩG(ΔfG)|ω|2dμf-2∫ΩG⟨∇dGω,ω⟩dμf=∫ΩG(ΔfG)|ω|2dμf-12∫Ω⟨dG2,d(|ω|2)⟩dμf=∫ΩG(ΔfG)|ω|2dμf-12∫Ω|ω|2(ΔfG2)dμf=∫Ω|ω|2|dG|2dμf.

In the last equality, we use the fact that ΔfG2=2GΔfG-2|dG|2 which can be shown by a straightforward computation. Also, we have that3.15 ∫Ω|[Δf,G]ω|2dμf=∫Ω(ΔfG)2|ω|2dμf+4∫Ω|∇dGω|2dμf-4∫ΩΔfG⟨ω,∇dGω⟩dμf.

In the following, we will assume that the manifold Ω is a domain in a complete Riemannian manifold (Mn,g) that is isometrically immersed into the Euclidean space Rn+m endowed with its canonical metric. We choose in the above formulas the function G to be G=xl,l=1,…,n+m the components of the immersion X=(x1,…,xn+m). Recall that (∂xl)T=d(xl∘ι) where ι is the isometric immersion. In addition, ω=ωi are eigenforms of the problem (3.13) associated to the eigenvalues λi,p,f that are chosen to be of L2-norm equal to 1. The computation done in (3.14) gives after summing over l that∑l=1m+n∫Ω⟨[Δf,xl]ωi,xlωi⟩dμf=∑l=1m+n∫Ω|dxl|2|ωi|2dμf=n.

Recall here that ∑l=1n+m|dxl|2=n. By taking G=xl in Eq. (3.15) and summing over l yields∑l=1n+m∫Ω|[Δf,xl]ωi|2dμf=∑l=1n+m∫Ω(Δfxl)2|ωi|2dμf+4∑l=1n+m∫Ω|∇dxlωi|2dμf-4∑l=1n+m∫Ω(Δfxl)⟨ωi,∇dxlωi⟩dμf.=∑l=1n+m∫ΩΔxl+g(df,dxl)2|ωi|2dμf+4∫Ω|∇dxlωi|2dμf-4∫ΩΔxl+g(df,dxl)⟨ωi,∇dxlωi⟩dμf=∫Ω(n2|H|2+|df|2+2ng(df,H))|ωi|2dμf+4∫Ω|∇ωi|2dμf-2∫Ω(ng(H,d|ωi|2)+g(df,d|ωi|2))dμf=∫Ω(n2|H|2+|df|2)|ωi|2dμf+4∫Ω|∇ωi|2dμf-2∫Ωg(df,d|ωi|2)dμf.

Here, we used that the mean curvature of the immersion is given by H=1n(Δx1,…,Δxn+m). Applying the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula (2.6) to ωi and taking the scalar product with ωi itself, the above equality acquires the form:∑l=1n+m∫Ω|[Δf,xl]ωi|2dμf=∫Ω(n2|H|2+|df|2)|ωi|2dμf+4λi,p,f-12∫ΩΔf(|ωi|2)dμf-∫Ω⟨(B[p]+Tf[p])ωi,ωi⟩dμf-2∫Ω(Δff)|ωi|2dμf=∫Ω(n2|H|2+|df|2)|ωi|2dμf+4λi,p,f-12∫∂Ω∂∂ν(|ωi|2)dμf-∫Ω⟨(B[p]+Tf[p])ωi,ωi⟩dμf-2∫Ω(Δf+|df|2)|ωi|2dμf=∫Ωn2|H|2|ωi|2dμf+4λi,p,f-∫Ω⟨(B[p]+Tf[p])ωi,ωi⟩dμf-∫Ω(2Δf+|df|2)|ωi|2dμf.

Inserting the above equations into (3.11) and (3.12) completes the proof of Theorem 1.3. □

Proof of Theorem 1.7

First of all, let u be the function given byui1,…,ip+1=⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧ω⟩

where ω is a p-form on M and ν is the inward unit normal vector field. Throughout the proof we will denote by ∇n+1 the connection on Rn+1 and by ∇ the connection on M, as well as for dn+1 and d. To simplify the notations, we will denote ui1,…,ip+1 by u in the following technical lemma (see [21, Lem. 3.1] for p=1).

Lemma 3.4

Suppose that M is a f-minimal hypersurface of the weighted manifold (Rn+1,g=can,e-fdvg). Then, we haveLfu=-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,(∇νn+1dn+1f)T∧ω⟩+2⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(ei)∧∇eiω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧(II2)[p]ω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧Δfω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧(II[p])2ω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧T~f[p]ω⟩-Hessn+1f(ν,ν)u.

Here T~f[p] is defined in the same way as in Sect. 2.2 on Rn+1.

Proof

For any X∈TM, we haveX(u)=-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(X)∧ω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧∇Xω⟩.

Here, we used the fact that (∇Xn+1ω)T=∇Xω, since ω is a differential form on M. Differentiating again with respect to X yieldsX(X(u))=-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,∇Xn+1II(X)∧ω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(X)∧∇Xn+1ω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(X)∧∇Xω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧∇Xn+1∇Xω⟩=-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,∇XII(X)∧ω⟩-|II(X)|2⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧ω⟩-2⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(X)∧∇Xω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(X)∧ν∧II(X)⌟ω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧∇X∇Xω⟩.

In the last part, we used the Gauss formula and the identity ν⌟∇Xn+1ω=II(X)⌟ω. Now tracing over an orthonormal frame {ei} of TM gives thatΔfu=Δu+g(df,du)=-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,(δII)∧ω⟩+|II|2⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧ω⟩+2⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(ei)∧∇eiω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧(II2)[p]ω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧∇ei∇eiω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(df)∧ω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧∇dfω⟩.=n⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,dH∧ω⟩+|II|2u+2⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(ei)∧∇eiω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧(II2)[p]ω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧∇f∗∇ω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(df)∧ω⟩.

In the last equality, we used the fact that δII=-ndH and the expression of ∇f∗∇. Now, combining Equation (4.5) with the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula (2.6) combined with (4.5) that is shown in the next section, the above equality reduces toΔfu=n⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,dH∧ω⟩+|II|2u+2⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(ei)∧∇eiω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧(II2)[p]ω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧Δfω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧(II[p])2-nHII[p]-Tf[p]ω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(df)∧ω⟩.

Now, for a f-minimal hypersurface, we writedn+1f=df+∂f∂νν=df-nHν.

Hence, by differentiating along a vector X∈TM, we get that(∇Xn+1dn+1f)T=∇Xdf+nHII(X).

Therefore, we find(T~f[p]ω)T=∑i=1nei∧(∇in+1dn+1f)T⌟ω=Tf[p]ω+nHII[p]ω.

Also, we have thatndH=-d∂f∂ν=-(∇νn+1dn+1f)T+II(df).

Hence, plugging these computations into the expression of Δfu, we arrive atΔfu=-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,(∇νn+1dn+1f)T∧ω⟩+|II|2u+2⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,II(ei)∧∇eiω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧(II2)[p]ω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧Δfω⟩+⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧(II[p])2ω⟩-⟨∂xi1∧…∧∂xip+1,ν∧T~f[p]ω⟩.

The proof of the lemma then follows from the expression of Lf. □

In order to complete the proof of Theorem 1.7, we proceed as in [21]. Let {φj} be an L2(e-fdvg)-orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions of Lf associated to λj(Lf). Let Ed be the sum of the first d-eigenspaces of Δf:Ed=⊕j=1dVΔf(λj,p,f).

For all l≥2, we consider the following system of equations∫Mui1,…,ip+1φ1dμf=…=∫Mui1,…,ip+1φl-1dμf=0,

where we recall that ui1,…,ip+1=⟨∂xi1∧…∂xip+1,ν∧ω⟩. This system consists of n+1p+1(l-1) homogeneous linear equations in the variable ω∈Ed. Hence, if we take d=n+1p+1(l-1)+1, we can find a non-trivial ω∈Ed which is orthogonal to the first (l-1)-eigenfunctions of Lf. Therefore, we deduce thatλl(Lf)∫M(ui1,…,ip+1)2dμf≤∫Mui1,…,ip+1Lf(ui1,…,ip+1)dμf.

Summing over i1<…<ip+1, we first have for the l.h.s. that∑i1<…<ip+1(ui1,…,ip+1)2=|ν∧ω|2=|ω|2.

For the r.h.s. of the previous inequality, we use the previous lemma to get that∑i1<…<ip+1ui1,…,ip+1Lf(ui1,…,ip+1)=2⟨ν∧ω,II(ei)∧∇eiω⟩-⟨ν∧ω,ν∧(II2)[p]ω⟩+⟨ν∧ω,ν∧Δfω⟩+⟨ν∧ω,ν∧(II[p])2ω⟩-⟨ν∧ω,ν∧T~f[p]ω⟩-Hessn+1f(ν,ν)|ν∧ω|2=-⟨(II2)[p]ω,ω⟩+⟨Δfω,ω⟩+⟨(II[p])2ω,ω⟩-⟨T~f[p]ω,ω⟩-Hessn+1f(ν,ν)|ω|2.

Hence, we deduce thatλl(Lf)∫M|ω|2dμf≤∫M(-⟨(II2)[p]ω,ω⟩+⟨Δfω,ω⟩+⟨(II[p])2ω,ω⟩-⟨T~f[p]ω,ω⟩-Hessn+1f(ν,ν)|ω|2)dμf≤∫M-⟨(II2)[p]ω,ω⟩+⟨Δfω,ω⟩+⟨(II[p])2ω,ω⟩-(p+1)a|ω|2dμf.

In the last equality, we used the fact that any eigenvalue of the operator T~f[p] is the sum of p-distinct eigenvalues of Hessn+1f. Now, we have that∫M⟨Δfω,ω⟩dμf≤λd(l),p,f∫M|ω|2dμf,

since ω∈Ed(l). Also, we have that-⟨(II2)[p]ω,ω⟩+⟨(II[p])2ω,ω⟩=-∑i=1n⟨II(ei)∧II(ei)⌟ω,ω⟩+∑i=1nei∧II(ei)⌟ω2=-∑i,j=1n⟨ej⌟II(ei)⌟ω,ei⌟II(ej)⌟ω⟩≤γMp(p-1)|ω|2.

Finally, we deduce thatλl(Lf)≤λd(l),p,f-(p+1)a+γMp(p-1),

which finishes the proof of the theorem. □

Proof of Corollaries 1.8 and 1.9

Let l0 be the largest integer such that d(l0)≤β. Thus,Indf(M)≥l0.

Now as we have that d1n+1p+1β+1-1n+1p+1≤β, thenl0≥1n+1p+1β+1-1n+1p+1≥1n+1p+1β.

This proves the first corollary. To prove the second one, we take as beforel0=1n+1p+1bp(M)+1-1n+1p+1,

then, we clearly have that d(l0)≤bp(M). Therefore, λd(l0),p,f=0. In the case of a self-shrinker, we recall that for f=|X|22 the hypersurface M is f-minimal and that Hessn+1f=g=can. Hence with the assumption p(p-1)γM≤p+1, we deduce that λl0(Lf)≤0. Finally, we get that the index is at least n+1+l0 by the fact that Lf has at least n+1 eigenvalues equal to -1. This finishes the proof. □

Geometric Applications of the Main Results

In this section we will provide several geometric applications of Theorem 1.3 by making explicit choices of the function f.

First, we will consider the case when f is the Riemannian distance function in order to compute explicitly the different terms in the statement of Theorem 1.3. To this end, let Mn→Rn+m be an isometric immersion and Ω a domain in M. Consider the function f:Ω→R given by f(X)=a|X|22, where a is a real positive number. This particular choice of f has important applications in mean curvature flow as described in the introduction of the article. Here, |·| denotes the Euclidean norm in Rn+m and X=(x1,…,xn+m) are the components of the immersion. In other words, the function f is the square of the distance function from the origin point 0∈Rn+m to a point X∈Ω. Using the decomposition X=XT+X⊥, we have that dn+mf=aX and therefore, df=aXT. Hence, we deduce that4.1 |df|2=a2(|X|2-|X⊥|2).

For any Y∈TM, we compute4.2 ∇Ydf=a∇YXT=a(∇Yn+mXT)T=a(Y-∇Yn+mX⊥)T=aY-∑i=1n(∇Yn+mX⊥,ei)ei=aY+∑i=1n(X⊥,∇Yn+mei)ei=aY+∑i=1n(X⊥,II(Y,ei))ei=a(Y+IIX⊥(Y)),

where IIX⊥ is defined as in the proof of Theorem 1.1. By tracing (4.2), we deduce that4.3 Δf=a(-n-n(X,H)).

Also, plugging (4.2) into the expression of Tf[p] yieldsTf[p]ω=a(pω+II⊥[p]ω),

where IIZ[p] is the canonical extension of IIZ to p-forms as defined in (3.3). Hence, we deduce4.4 ⟨Tf[p]ω,ω⟩=ap|ω|2+⟨II⊥[p]ω,ω⟩.

In the following, we will bound the term ⟨B[p]ωi,ωi⟩ in Theorem 1.3 by using the results of [38]. For this, recall that A. Savo shows in [38, Thm. 1] that for any isometric immersion (Mn,g)→(Nn+m,g), the Bochner operator B[p] on p-forms of M splits asB[p]=Bext[p]+Bres[p],

where Bext[p] is the operator defined byBext[p]=∑j=1mtrace(IIνj)IIνj[p]-IIνj[p]∘IIνj[p].

Here, {ν1,…,νm} is a local orthonormal frame of TM⊥, and the operator Bres[p] is the operator that satisfiesp(n-p)γN≤Bres[p]≤p(n-p)ΓN,

where γN and ΓN are respectively a lower bound and an upper bound for the curvature operator of N. Hence for an isometric immersion M→(Rn+m,can), we deduce that4.5 B[p]=Bext[p]=IInH[p]-∑j=1mIIνj[p]∘IIνj[p].

Inserting Equations (4.1), (4.3), (4.4) and (4.5) in Theorem 1.3, we deduce

Corollary 4.1

Let X:(Mn,g)→(Rn+m,can) be an isometric immersion and let f=a|X|22 where a is a real positive number. For any p∈{0,…,n}, the eigenvalues of the drifting Hodge Laplacian Δf acting on p-forms on a domain Ω of M with Dirichlet boundary conditions satisfy for any k≥1∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α-1(λi,p,f-∫Ω⟨II(aX⊥+nH)[p]ωi,ωi⟩dμf+∑j=1m∫Ω|IIνj[p]ωi|2dμf-ap+na2-a24∫Ω|X|2|ωi|2dμf+14∫Ω|aX⊥+nH|2|ωi|2dμf),

for α≤2. Also, we have∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤2αn∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α-1(λi,p,f-∫Ω〈II(aX⊥+nH)[p]ωi,ωi〉dμf+∑j=1m∫Ω|IIνj[p]ωi|2dμf-ap+na2-a24∫Ω|X|2|ωi|2dμf+14∫Ω|aX⊥+nH|2|ωi|2dμf),

for α≥2.

The result in Corollary 4.1 generalizes the one in [42, Thm. 1.1] when taking a=12,α=2 and Ω=M being a domain in Rm. In this case, II=0 and we get that∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)2≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)λi,p,f-p2+n4-116minΩ(|X|2).

Moreover, Corollary 4.1 generalizes the result in [42, Thm 1.2] when taking for some integer l>1, the number a=l-1,α=2 and (Mn,g)=(Rn-l×Sl(1),⟨,⟩Rn-l⊕⟨,⟩Sl) where ⟨,⟩Sl is the standard metric on the unit round sphere Sl(1) of curvature 1. Indeed, we take the immersion M↪Rn-l×Rl+1 where the second fundamental form is given by the matrix 000Id. Thus, we have X⊥=-ν and nH=trace(II)=lν and, therefore, aX⊥+nH=ν. Also, using that II[p]ω=∑i=1nei∧II(ei)⌟ω for any p-form ω, we deduce by a straightforward computation that-⟨II[p]ω,ω⟩+|II[p]ω|2=∑i,j=n-l+1n|ei⌟ej⌟ω|2≤p(p-1)|ω|2.

Hence, we get that∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)2≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)λi,p,f+2n(l-1)+1-4p(l-1)+4p(p-1)4-(l-1)24minΩ(|X|2).

Corollary 4.1 also generalizes the one in [10] on compact self-shrinkers. In this case, for a=1, we get that∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)2≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)(λi,p,f+∑j=1m∫Ω|IIνj[p]ωi|2dμf-p+n2-14minΩ(|X|2)).

In the last part of this section, we will consider the case when f is the distance function from some fixed point in M with respect to the Riemannian metric g on M. For this, fix a point x0∈M and consider the distance functiondx0:Ω→[0,∞[,dx0(x)=d(x0,x)

and ρx0(x):=12dx0(x)2. We recall from [31] that the distance function dx0 is smooth in the complement of the cut locus of x0 and that its gradient is of norm 1 almost everywhere. Thus we will choose a domain Ω⊂M such that it is contained in this complement. Let us recall the comparison theorem [31] (see also [18]). For this, we consider for any l∈R, the functionHl(r)=(n-1)lcot(lr),l>0n-1r,l=0(n-1)|l|coth(|l|r),l<0.

Theorem 4.2

[31]. Let (Mn,g) be a complete Riemannian manifold. If RicM≥(n-1)l for some l∈R, then for every x0∈M, the inequalities Δdx0(x)≥-Hl(dx0(x)),andΔρx0(x)≥-(1+dx0(x)Hl(dx0(x)),

hold at smooth points of dx0. Moreover, these inequalities hold on the whole manifold in the sense of distributions.

If the sectional curvature satisfies l1≤KM≤l2 and γ is a minimizing geodesic starting from x0∈M such that its image is disjoint to the cut locus of x0, then ∇2dx0(X,X)≤Hl1(t)n-1g(X,X),and∇2dx0(X,X)≥Hl2(t)n-1g(X,X),

for X⊥γ˙(t) and ∇2dx0(γ˙(t),γ˙(t))=0, for t∈[0,L] for some L. As a consequence, one has that ∇2ρx0(X,X)≤tHl1(t)n-1g(X,X),and∇2ρx0(X,X)≥tHl2(t)n-1g(X,X),

for X⊥γ˙(t) and ∇2ρx0(γ˙(t),γ˙(t))=1.

We will now use Theorem 4.2 to compute the different terms in Theorem 1.3. We begin with the case when RicM≥(n-1)l for some l∈R on the manifold M. By taking f=aρx0 where a>0, we deduce that the inequalities|df|2=a2dx02,andΔf(x)≥-a1+dx0(x)Hl(dx0(x)

hold in the sense of distributions. Therefore, we deduce from Theorem 1.3 the following

Corollary 4.3

Let X:(Mn,g)→(Rn+m,can) be an isometric immersion. Assume that RicM≥(n-1)l for some l∈R. Let x0 be fixed point in M and Ω a domain in the complement of the cut locus of x0. Let f=aρx0 for some positive real number a>0. The eigenvalues of the drifting Hodge Laplacian Δf acting on p-forms on Ω with Dirichlet boundary conditions satisfy for any k≥1∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α-1(λi,p,f-δ1+14δ2),

for α≤2, where δ1=infΩ(B[p]+Tf[p]) and δ2 is given byδ2=supx∈Ωn2|H|2+2a(1+dx0(x)Hl(dx0(x))-a2dx0(x)2.

Also, we have∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤2αn∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α-1(λi,p,f-δ1+14δ2),

for α≥2.

In the following, we will consider the case when the sectional curvature of M is bounded from below by l1 and from above by l2. We let δ2 be the number given byδ2:=supx∈Ωn2|H|2-4a(p-1)dx0(x)Hl2(dx0(x))n-1+1+2a(1+dx0Hl1(dx0))-a2dx02,l2≤0supx∈Ωn2|H|2-4apdx0(x)Hl2(dx0(x))n-1+2a(1+dx0Hl1(dx0))-a2dx02,l2>0.

We have

Corollary 4.4

Let X:(Mn,g)→(Rn+m,can) be an isometric immersion. Assume that l1≤KM≤l2 for some l1,l2∈R. Let Ω a domain in M such that Ω is contained in the complement of the cut locus of x0∈Ω. Let f=aρx0 for some positive real number a>0. For any p∈{0,…,n}, the eigenvalues of the drifting Hodge Laplacian Δf acting on p-forms on a domain Ω of M with Dirichlet boundary conditions satisfy for any k≥1∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤4n∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α-1)λi,p,f-∫Ω⟨IInH[p]ωi,ωi⟩dμf+∑j=1m-n∫Ω|IIνj[p]ωi|2dμf+14δ2

for α≤2. Also, we have∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α≤2αn∑i=1k(λk+1,p,f-λi,p,f)α-1)λi,p,f-∫Ω⟨IInH[p]ωi,ωi⟩dμf+∑j=1m-n∫Ω|IIνj[p]ωi|2dμf+14δ2

for α≥2.

Proof

We proceed as in [36]. At any point x∈Ω\{x0}, there is an orthonormal frame {e1(x),…,en-1(x),en=∇dx0(x)} such that ∇2ρx0 has the eigenvalues η1(x),…,ηn-1(x),1. By the comparison theorem 4.2, we get that for any j=1,…,n-1dx0(x)Hl2(dx0(x))n-1≤ηj(x)≤dx0(x)Hl1(dx0(x))n-1.

Therefore, we find that|df|2=a2dx02andΔf≥-a(1+dx0Hl1(dx0)).

Recall that the endomorphism Tf[p] is by definition the sum of p distinct eigenvalues of ∇2f. Hence, for any p-form ω, we get that ⟨Tf[p]ω,ω⟩≥a(p-1)dx0(x)Hl2(dx0(x))n-1+1|ω|2,l2≤0apdx0(x)Hl2(dx0(x))n-1|ω|2,l2>0.

This is because of dx0(x)Hl2(dx0(x))n-1≥1 if l2≤0 and dx0(x)Hl2(dx0(x))n-1≤1 if l2>0. Replacing all these inequalities in Theorem 1.3, we get the result after combining with Eq. (4.5) for the curvature term.□
