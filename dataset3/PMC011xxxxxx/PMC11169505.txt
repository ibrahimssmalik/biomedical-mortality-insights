Regarding to their unique physical and mechanical features, glasses and glass–ceramics are suitable materials for shielding purposes. The present study evaluates the shielding properties of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass system using Monte Carlo GEANT4 and MCNPX codes for X-ray radiations with an energy range of 20 to 100 keV. MAC values of the Ta0, Ta1, Ta2, Ta2.5, and Ta3 samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass were computed using Phy-X/PSD, GEANT4, and MCNPX codes and compared. According to the results, the programs have good compatibility with each other. For instance, in the energy of 40 keV and for the Ta2 sample, GEANT4 and MCNP codes are 1.445765406 and 1.517801204 cm2/g, respectively, indicating 7.419529525 and 2.829628418% differences with 1.562 cm2/g obtained using the Phy-X/PSD software. According to recent estimations, the Ta3 sample of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass system can be selected as the best shield compared with the other samples.

Nowadays, with the advancement of nuclear technology in various areas of science (e.g., industries, nuclear reactors, and especially medical centers), humans, plants, and animals are exposed to neutrons, heavy particles and ions, and gamma radiation. Therefore, research on protecting humans, plants, and animals from serious hazards of those radiations has been the subject of intense research1,2. Over the past decades, various shielding materials, e.g., wide range of stones, concretes, alloys, polymers, and glasses have been developed and used as materials with appropriate mechanical, optical, and shielding properties for protecting from radiation dangers3–7. Saleh et al.8 studied the structure, mechanical, and nuclear shielding properties of lead-free Sn–Zn–Bi alloys. Adib estimated neutron characteristics of single-crystal magnesium fluoride9. Also, Elnaggar10 investigated the effect of heavy chemical additives on the mechanical properties of cement pastes, radiation exposure the corrosion behavior of reinforced steel upon exposure to seawater. Recently, glass and glass–ceramic production has been interesting for researchers regarding their unique physical, chemical, and mechanical features (e.g., facile production, high optical transparency, low cost, low melting point, high thermal stability, chemical persistence, and easy formatting in shapes and sizes)11,12. The gamma and neutron radiation features of various sorts of glasses have been studied either by applying experimental methods or using simulation codes such as Geant4, MCNPX, and FLUKA13–15. Alzahrani et al.16 evaluated the radiation shielding properties of boron silicate glasses containing CrO3. Moreover, Alzahrani et al.17 studied the optical properties and radiation shielding effectiveness of Sm3+‑doped Zinc Boro phosphate glasses. Saleh et al.18 studied the effect of the PbO on the physical, structural, and protection features of TeO2–B2O3 glass against gamma, neutron, proton and alpha particles. Also, Saleh explored gamma and neutron shielding features of the gadolinium silico-borate glasses system19. According to Madhavi et al.20, Ta-dopped glasses have good biocompatibility, high mechanical strength, and high coefficient of friction. Also, the Ta-dopped glass system of CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 has in-vitro bioactivity and antibacterial properties. Moreover, the shielding properties of the glass have not been studied before. Therefore, consistent with previous studies21–24, in this study, the shielding parameters of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass system are evaluated using the GEANT4 toolkit and MCNPX code for the X-ray radiations. In this respect, the bioactivity and antibacterial properties of the glass have already been studied by Madhavi20. The calculations are considered for X-ray photons with energy range between 20 and 100 keV. Phy-X/PSD software was selected to evaluate MAC values and to compare them with the simulation results of MCNPX and GEANT4.

Materials and methods

Sample details

The CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass has already been synthesized by the melt quenching technique20. Five glass samples were prepared with stable percentages of CaF2, CaO, B2O3, and SrO and different chemical compositions of P2O5 and Ta2O520. The samples named as Ta0 (0% Ta2O5), Ta1 (1% Ta2O5), Ta2 (2% Ta2O5), Ta2.5 (2.5% Ta2O5), and Ta3 (3% Ta2O5)20. Table 1 represents the chemical compositions and density of each sample that is simulated using MCNPX and GEANT4 codes in this study, as reported by Madhavi20.Table 1 Chemical composition (mole %) and density details of the glass samples.

GEANT4 and MCNP simulation geometry

GEANT4 toolkit

GEANT4 toolkit is a Monte Carlo package that uses random numbers during the calculation process. GEANT4 code can be used to simulate passing various sorts of particles either charged or non-charged with any range of energy within different types of materials. Moreover, an excellent feature of this code is the flexibility of choosing arbitrary physics lists and input, and output parameters25,26. In the present work, GEANT4-10.7, a version of GEANT4 code is employed to simulate the set-up of the X-ray radiations and calculate the shielding parameters.

MCNPX code

MCNPX, an improved Monte Carlo package by Los Alamos National Laboratory, is applied for calculating the shielding features of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass system against photons with an energy range of 20–100 keV. Also, the code is designed to simulate a wide range of energies for different particles (alpha, photon, proton, neutron, deuteron, electron, 3He etc.) and various types of materials (elements, compositions, and mixtures). In MCNP code, the geometry can be illustrated in 2D and 3D dimensions, which is one of the best features of the code. The geometry part of the target, source, detector, and tally key can be defined in the input file of the code26. In the present study, MCNPX-2.6, a version of the MCNPX code was selected to simulate the set-up of the X-ray radiations.

The geometry details and set-up

Figure 1 displays the geometry of an X-ray machine, which was selected for evaluating of shielding properties of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass system. As shown in Fig. 1, a glass sample prepared as a disk with 2 cm radius and 3 mm thickness is placed in the middle of the photon source with an energy range from 20 to 100 keV and a cylindrical detector with 2.54 cm radius and 2.54 cm thickness. The X-ray source is simulated as a circle plane with a radius of 1.5 mm, with the sample placed 10 cm far from the source and the detector. The physics lists of GEANT4 code that applied for the calculations of this study are G4EmStandardPhysics_option2, G4PhotoNuclearProcess, G4LowEGammaNuclearModel, and G4CascadeInterface.Figure 1 Geometry of X-ray radiation shielding simulated using MCNPX and GEANT4 codes: (a) before irradiating the samples, (b) during irradiating the sample.

Moreover, a simulation setup diagram from visual editor for GEANT4 and MCNP nuclear codes is displayed in Fig. 2. Photons exit from the top (the cubic), drop on the middle cylinder (the sample), and detect by the yellow cylinder (the detector). The flow chart of the overall simulation process of using GEANT4 and MCNP codes are illustrated in Fig. 3. The two Monte Carlo input files are including materials, source, and detector details, which with defining the tally, the cell flux of the photons can be seen in the output of the codes.Figure 2 The simulation setup diagram from Visual Editor for both GEANT4 and MCNP codes.

Figure 3 Operation of the simulation process of GEANT4 and MCNP codes.

Phy-X/PSD

The Phy-X/PSD software can determine shielding values for photon energies between 1 keV and 100 GeV for any materials in single elementals or mixture composites. This program illustrates the chemical compositions and density of the materials. Besides, it calculates various shielding parameters such as MAC, LAC, MFP, Zeff, HVL, and TVL using theoretical MAC values27,28. In this study, Phy-X/PSD software was selected to calculate the shielding features of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass system and compare with it GEANT4 and MCNPX simulated values.

Radiation parameters

Linear attenuation coefficient (LAC)

The linear attenuation coefficient (µ) is the number of particles or photons reflected from the beam per unit thickness of the sample surface. This coefficient is calculated in a unit of cm−1 using Eq. (1)29:1 LAC=-lnNN0x

where LAC is the linear attenuation coefficient (cm−1), N and N0 are primary and ultimate particle or photon numbers, respectively, and x is the thickness of the glass sample (cm).

Mass attenuation coefficient (MAC)

The mass attenuation coefficient is the probability of photons or particles that interact in a unit of mass of the glass sample. It can be computed using Eq. (2)30:2 MAC=LACρ=∑iWi(MAC)i

where LAC is the linear attenuation coefficient (cm−1), MAC is the mass attenuation coefficient (cm2/g), Wi is the weight fraction, and ρ denotes the glass sample density (g/cm3).

Half-value layer (HVL)

The thickness of the glass sample that cut the power of the particle or photon beam in half is defined as the half-value layer. Equation (3) is used to evaluate HVL31:3 HVL=ln(2)LAC

where HVL is the half-value layer (cm) and LAC is the linear attenuation coefficient (cm−1).

Tenth-value layer (TVL)

The tenth-value layer of the sample glass is the thickness of the glass that attenuates the intensity of the beam to one-tenth of its primary strength. The TVL is calculated by Eq. (4)31:4 TVL=ln(10)LAC

where TVL is the tenth-value layer (cm) and the LAC is the linear attenuation coefficient (cm−1).

Mean free path (MFP)

The distance between two successive interactions of the particles or photons through the glass sample is defined as the mean free path, which can be estimated by Eq. (5)31:5 MFP=1LAC

where MFP is the mean free path (cm) and LAC denotes the linear attenuation coefficient (cm−1).

Effective atomic number

The effective atomic number (Zeff) of the samples is expressed by Eq. (6)32:6 Zeff=∑ifiAiMACi∑jAjZjMACi

MAC values of the GEANT4 code and Phys-x software were compared using Eq. (7)32:7 Diff=MACPhy-x-MACGEANT4orMCNPMACPhy-x×100

Results and discussion

In this research, the shielding parameters of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass were computed for X-ray energies from 20 to 100 keV by the GEANT4 toolkit and MCNPX code. Figure 4 indicates the linear attenuation coefficient simulated results of five samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass. According to Fig. 4a, LAC values at 20 keV are 22.07342 and 22.42434066 cm−1 for GEANT4 and MCNP codes, respectively, while decline to 0.514242 and 0.553058358 cm−1 in the energy of 100 keV. Moreover, by increasing the percentages of Ta2O5 in samples, the values of LAC rise for the Ta0, Ta1, Ta2, Ta2.5, and Ta3 glass samples. For example, in the energy of 40 keV, the GEANT4 value of LAC reported in this study for the mentioned samples are 3.348961, 3.816376, 4.091516, 4.223683, and 4.444864 cm−1, while they are 3.503685242, 3.963567196, 4.295377408, 4.424974352, and 4.630099796 cm−1 for MCNP code, respectively. The measured values for other energies are summarized in Table 2. Due to the higher atomic number of Ta than P, with increasing the amount of Ta2O5, the density of the samples rises from 2.57 to 2.903 g/cm3 for the Ta0, Ta1, Ta2, Ta2,5, and Ta3 samples. As can be seen from Table 2, increasing the density has raised the value of the LAC parameter. Ta3 with the highest density value compared to other samples is the best shield against incident photons. Therefore, the behavior of the LAC is depended on the density and chemical composition of the samples, and the energy of photons.Figure 4 Linear attenuation coefficient values calculated using MCNPX and GEANT4 codes for (a) Ta0, (b) Ta1, (c) Ta2, (d) Ta2.5, and (e) Ta3 samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass.

Furthermore, Fig. 5 presents a 3D comparison of LAC results between the five samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass system.Figure 5 A comparison of linear attenuation coefficient parameter of the five samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass that evaluated by MCNPX and GEANT4 codes.

Figure 6. exhibits mass attenuation coefficient values estimated by MCNPX and GEANT4 codes for the Ta0, Ta1, Ta2, Ta2,5, and Ta3 samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass. According to this figure, MAC values for the mentioned samples decline continuously from 20 to 100 keV. The values of MAC for the GEANT4 toolkit in energy of 40 keV for the Ta0, Ta1, Ta2, Ta2,5, and Ta3 samples are 1.303098, 1.386764, 1.445765, 1.485121, and 1.531128 cm2/g, respectively. Also, the simulation outputs by MAC for MCNP code for the glass samples were reported to be 1.363301651, 1.440249708, 1.517801204, 1.555898155, and 1.594936203 cm2/g, respectively, which are in good agreement with the GEANT4 values. Table 3 lists the values of MAC for five mentioned samples obtained using GEANT4 and MCNP codes and Phy-X/PSD program in the energy range of 20 to 100 keV. Table 3 presents the differences between GEANT4 and MCNPX codes, and the Phy-X/PSD program. As can be seen, the outputs of these three software are in good agreement for all energy range and the five samples of the glass system.Figure 6 Mass attenuation coefficient values calculated using MCNPX and GEANT4 codes for (a) Ta0, (b) Ta1, (c) Ta2, (d) Ta2.5, and (e) Ta3 samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass.

Figure 8 presents the half-value layer GEANT4 and MCNP codes calculations of the Ta0, Ta1, Ta2, Ta2,5, and Ta3 samples for photons with energy ranging from 20 to 100 keV. According to this figure, HVL results for each sample start at 20 keV and gently rise to 100 keV. However, the values for samples with a higher of Ta2O5 content are less than others. For instance, in incident photons with energy of 40 keV, HVL of the five samples are obtained as 0.20693, 0.181586, 0.169375, 0.164075, and 0.15591 cm for the GEANT4 program, respectively. Meanwhile, the MCNP values were obtained as 0.19779174, 0.174842501, 0.161336231, 0.156611077, and 0.1496728 cm, respectively.

Figure 14 demonstrates the effective atomic number of the five samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass. The values of Zeff have the highest at 20 keV photon energy, which are 23.78, 24.76, 25.72, 26.18, and 26.64 for the Ta0, Ta1, Ta2, Ta2.5, and Ta3 samples, respectively. In this respect, the Zeff values decrease with increasing photon energy and such that lowest result belongs to 100 keV energy. Also, the Ta3 sample with the highest density has the highest Zeff value among the five samples. A comparison of Zeff for the five samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass system is given in Fig. 15. As can be noticed, the value of Zeff rise with increasing the density of samples.Figure 14 Effective atomic number for (a) Ta0, (b) Ta1, (c) Ta2, (d) Ta2.5, and (e) Ta3 samples of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass.

Conclusion

This research explored the shielding properties of the CaF2–CaO–B2O3–P2O5–SrO–Ta2O5 glass system with five different molar fractions of Ta2O5 using GEANT4 and MCNPX nuclear codes, and PhyX/PSD program. The density of the five samples was different from 2.57 to 2.903 g/cm3, depending on the amount of Ta2O5. The parameter of MAC for each sample was determined using the GEANT4 and MCNP codes for photons with an energy range between 20 and 100 keV and compared with the values of Phy-X/PSD software. In the energy of 40 keV and for the sample of Ta3, the values of Phy-X/PSD, GEANT4, and MCNP were estimated as 1.641, 1.531127875, and 1.594936203 cm2/g, respectively. In contrast, the Monte Carlo codes have 6.700746492 and 2.807056518% discrepancy with the online software. Besides, the value of MAC rises by increasing the Ta2O5 content. In the mentioned energy, for Ta0, Ta1, Ta2, Ta2.5, and Ta3 samples, the MAC values of the Phy-X/PSD program are 1.403, 1.482, 1.562, 1.601, and 1.641 cm2/g. Therefore, according to the results, the Ta3 sample was selected as the best shield against photons in comparison with the other samples.
