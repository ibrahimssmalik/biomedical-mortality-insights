Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with phenotypic variability. To gain insights into transcriptional regulation of cardiac phenotype, single-nucleus linked RNA-/ATAC-seq was performed in 5-week-old control mouse-hearts (WT) and two HCM-models (R92W-TnT, R403Q-MyHC) that exhibit differences in heart size/function and fibrosis; mutant data was compared to WT. Analysis of 23,304 nuclei from mutant hearts, and 17,669 nuclei from WT, revealed similar dysregulation of gene expression, activation of AP-1 TFs (FOS, JUN) and the SWI/SNF complex in both mutant ventricular-myocytes. In contrast, marked differences were observed between mutants, for gene expression/TF enrichment, in fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells. Cellchat predicted activation of pro-hypertrophic IGF-signaling in both mutant ventricular-myocytes, and profibrotic TGFβ-signaling only in mutant-TnT fibroblasts. In summary, our bioinformatics analyses suggest that activation of IGF-signaling, AP-1 TFs and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler complex promotes myocyte hypertrophy in early-stage HCM. Selective activation of TGFβ-signaling in mutant-TnT fibroblasts contributes to genotype-specific differences in cardiac fibrosis.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy1, and cause of sudden cardiac death in young individuals. A large proportion of HCM patients have ≥1 pathogenic variants in sarcomeric protein genes, that promote myocyte hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, coronary microvascular remodeling2, and lead to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), LV hypercontractility, diastolic dysfunction, microvascular ischemia3, left atrial enlargement4. Notably, the location and degree of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, as well as the age of onset of symptoms such as dyspnea, angina, heart failure, arrhythmias, is highly variable5. But the transcriptional regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity in HCM is poorly understood.

In order to understand molecular pathophysiology in HCM, several profiling studies (single nucleus RNA-seq6, 7, bulk RNA-seq8–10, proteomics, metabolomics11–13) have been performed in heart tissue from genotyped HCM patients at established disease stage, undergoing septal myectomy or heart transplant. These studies reveal marked changes in the transcriptome, metabolome and proteome, that are independent of HCM genotype. This is surprising because pathogenic variants in sarcomeric protein genes often have distinct biophysical effects14 that would be expected to lead to transcriptional differences. It is unknown whether the transcriptional landscape in HCM is similar at early and late disease stages for each pathogenic variant and clinical phenotype, or whether genotype-specific activation of transcriptional programs evolves into a common molecular phenotype, due to transcriptional convergence6, at established disease stage. Insights into transcriptional regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity are needed to assist with development of precision therapies for prevention of cardiac remodeling and complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

Single-nucleus (sn)-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq are powerful tools to study transcriptional changes and their regulation at a single cell level in all cell types in the heart, without cell sorting or dissociation (which can lead to biases associated with cardiomyocyte fragility). In this study, we employed the commercially available Multiome Kit to obtain linked gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from the same nuclei in two extensively characterized HCM mouse models9, 10, 15 that express pathogenic variants in thin (Tnnt2)16, 17 or thick filament (Myh6)18 genes, leading to phenotypes that span the spectrum of human disease (mild/no clinical LVH, sudden death at a young age19 in R92W-TnT+/-, and moderate LVH with heart failure requiring transplantation in middle age20, 21 in R403-βMyHC+/-). Both mutant proteins are incorporated into sarcomeres16, 22 and increase tension cost, but have markedly different biophysical effects14. Residue-92 is located in the α-tropomyosin-binding domain of cardiac troponin T, whereas residue-403 is located in the actin-binding motor domain of myosin heavy chain23. R92W-TnT+/- confers increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity of force development16, and is associated with LV hypercontractility, diastolic dysfunction, lower LV mass16, interstitial fibrosis, and induction of the fetal gene program16 in mice. Studies in R403Q-MyHC+/- show reduced myofibrillar contractility24, 25, greater myofiber isometric tension development at submaximal Ca2+ levels26, and slower LV relaxation27.

In this study, we performed linked sn-ATAC-seq and sn-RNA-seq in R92W-TnT, R403Q-MyHC and littermate control mouse hearts at 5 weeks of age, with the goal of obtaining insights into transcriptional regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity in early-stage HCM. Our studies were performed in mouse heart tissue rather than human heart tissue, because HCM patients at early disease stage generally do not have clinical indications for cardiac biopsies or heart surgery. We hypothesized that a combination of mutation-specific changes in cardiomyocytes, and crosstalk between ventricular cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, endothelial cells (ECs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), macrophages underlie phenotypic variability in HCM, because mutant sarcomeric proteins are only expressed in cardiomyocytes. Our studies revealed activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin remodeler complexes (SWI/SNF, ISWI) in both mutant ventricular-cardiomyocytes. The transcriptional landscapes of mutant TnT and MyHC ventricular-cardiomyocytes were generally similar, whereas fibroblasts, macrophages, ECs, VSMCs were markedly different. Greater chromatin remodeling was seen in all cardiac cell types from mutant-TnT when compared to mutant-MyHC. Interrogation of cellular crosstalk using Cellchat predicted enrichment of pro-fibrotic signaling only in mutant-TnT, and pro-hypertrophic growth factor signaling to ventricular-cardiomyocytes in both mutants. Taken together, our studies provide an integrated view of transcriptional regulation in individual cardiac cell types, that contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity in HCM.

RESULTS

Study design:

We performed deep cardiac phenotyping of mutant-TnT (R92W-TnT), MyHC (R403Q-MyHC) and littermate-control mice (CTR) at 5 weeks of age, which corresponds to early-disease stage. We examined cardiac morphology using echocardiography, histology, and isolated nuclei from the right and left ventricles (RV, LV), right and left atrial appendages (RAA, LAA) for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. We compared gene expression and chromatin accessibility data between mutant and control mice using ArchR, SCENIC, Gene Ontology (GO), Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), KEGG, WikiPathways, CellChat (Fig 1a–b), to gain insights into transcriptional regulation and cellular crosstalk in cardiomyocytes and non-myocyte cells at early stage HCM.

Phenotypic heterogeneity at early disease stage:

Mutant-TnT hearts demonstrated marked biatrial enlargement, whereas LA size was similar in MyHC-mutants, when compared to respective littermate controls (Fig 1c). Picrosirius staining revealed higher diffuse global fibrosis in TnT-mutants, but no difference in MyHC-mutants when compared to respective littermate-controls (Fig 1d). Echocardiography revealed lower left ventricular (LV) mass, mitral valve A velocity, and higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial (LA) size in mutant-TnT hearts compared to littermate-controls (Fig 1e). In contrast, MyHC-mutants had higher LV mass and LA diameter, similar LVEF, mitral A velocity size as littermate-controls (Fig 1e). Taken together histology and echocardiography reveal marked differences in cardiac phenotype at early disease stage, with interstitial fibrosis, LV diastolic dysfunction, LV hypercontractility without hypertrophy in TnT-mutants, and LVH with similar LV systolic/diastolic function in MyHC-mutants.

Single nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility analysis in mutant hearts compared to littermate controls:

To examine transcriptional regulation of phenotypic differences at early disease stage, we isolated nuclei from mutant and littermate-control hearts at 5 weeks of age, and performed linked sn-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. We compared 23,304 nuclei from mutant hearts with 17,669 nuclei from controls, to identify cell-type and allele-specific transcriptional programs activated in early-stage HCM.

The RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data was integrated using Harmony, to generate 25 clusters that represent all known cardiac cell types (Fig 1f–g). Cluster identity was determined using known marker gene expression for each cell type, along with cluster-defining differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility (Suppl. Fig 1a–c). We identified clusters comprised of leukocytes (C1-5), cardiomyocytes (C6-9), epicardial cells (C10-12), endothelial cells (C13-17), vascular smooth muscle cells (C18-20) and fibroblasts (C21-23); two clusters could not be assigned to any cell type (Fig 1g–h).

As expected, ventricular-cardiomyocytes showed the highest differential gene expression between mutants and controls (Fig 1i). In all other cardiac cell types, mutant-TnT cells had greater dysregulation of gene expression, when compared to mutant-MyHC (Fig 1i). Additionally, greater chromatin remodeling was observed across all cardiac cell types in mutant-TnT, when compared to mutant-MyHC (Fig 1j). Taken together, our data indicates that at early disease stage, these two pathogenic variants in sarcomeric protein genes Tnnt2 and Myh6 are associated with profound changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in all cardiac cell types, with greater allele-specific differences in fibroblasts, leukocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and epicardial cells when compared to cardiomyocytes.

AP-1 transcription factors and chromatin remodeler complexes are activated in mutant ventricular cardiomyocytes at early disease stage:

Unbiased clustering grouped cardiomyocytes into four clusters (C6-9), of which Cluster 9 (C9) was the largest (Fig 2a), and represented ventricular-cardiomyocytes, based on expression of genes such as Tnnt2, Myh6 (Suppl. Fig 1a–c). Ventricular-cardiomyocytes demonstrated 1877 commonly upregulated genes between the 2 mutants, and a smaller proportion of upregulated genes specific to each mutant (n=228 in TnT; n=581 in MyHC); very few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were downregulated (Fig 2b, Suppl. Fig 2a-d). A notable genotype-specific response was marked upregulation (log2FC >3) of the nucleus/golgi-localized zinc transporter Slc39a11, and the beta globin gene Hbb-bs in mutant TnT ventricular-cardiomyocytes (Suppl. Fig 2b). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed enrichment for processes such as DNA transcription, post-translational protein modifications/breakdown in both mutant ventricular-cardiomyocytes (Suppl. Fig 2g–h). Additionally, IPA revealed that ventricular-cardiomyocytes from both mutants had signatures of cardiac hypertrophy signaling (Fig 2c), as well as upregulation of hypertrophy-associated genes (e.g. Sorbs2, Pdlim5, Camk2d, Ryr2, Prkg1) and TFs (e.g. Mef2a/c, Gata4/6, Ep300) (Fig 2d).

Chromatin accessibility was increased for 42,880 and 39,791 features, and decreased for 57,396 and 52,175 features, in mutant TnT and MyHC ventricular-cardiomyocytes, respectively (Suppl. Fig 2e–f). Motif enrichment analysis using ArchR predicted similar differential motif enrichment in the 2 mutants, with a stronger response in mutant-TnT when compared to mutant-MyHC (Fig 2e). Enrichment of AP-1 (activator protein 1) motifs28 was predicted in both mutants (Fig 2e), with stronger enrichment in mutant-TnT, whereas PGR and NR3C1 were only enriched in mutant-MyHC (Fig 2e). Analysis of TF gene expression confirmed modest upregulation of several subunits (Smarcc1, Smarca2, Smarcc2, Smarca5, Smarcad1) of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler complexes, SWI/SNF29, ISWI30, as well as Gata4/6, Bach2, and several members of the Atf and Nfat families of TFs (Fig 2f).

Next, in order to examine the association between increased chromatin accessibility and TF gene expression with downstream gene expression, we used SCENIC to identify groups of co-expressed genes (regulons) driven by a specific TF, and surveyed for matches between TF activation predicted by SCENIC (RNA-seq data) and ArchR (ATAC-seq data) by computing a combined z-score (mean of the respective z-scores), with the goal of strengthening our predictions of activated TFs (Fig 2g). The greatest differences between mutants and controls were seen for Smarcc2, Smarca4, Jun, Bach1 regulons (using RNA-seq data), with controls showing no Smarca4 activity and very small Jun and Smarcc2 activity (Fig 2 g–i). Pseudo bulked TF-footprinting of the JUN and FOS motifs showed higher Tn5 biased normalized insertions reflecting higher TF occupancy in mutants compared to controls, with mutant-TnT ventricular-cardiomyocytes demonstrating greater occupation than mutant-MyHC (Fig 2j). Smarca4, Jun, Bach1, Atf6 regulon genes were enriched for biologic processes such as autophagy, protein processing in ER, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, lysosome, apoptosis (Fig 2k), and signaling pathways such as ERK/MAPK, IGF1, integrin, FAK, mTOR, beta adrenergic and cardiac hypertrophy signaling. (Fig 2l).

In summary, our analysis of linked RNA-seq and ATAC-seq at early disease stage suggest activation of cardiac hypertrophy signaling, AP-1 TFs and chromatin remodeler complexes in both mutant ventricular-cardiomyocytes. We hypothesize that these pathogenic variants in Tnnt2 and Myh6 lead to activation of signaling pathways and AP-1 TFs (Suppl. Fig 3a), which recruit chromatin remodeler complexes, SWI/SNF, ISWI (Suppl. Fig 3b). Chromatin remodeling enables activation of late response genes involved in autophagy, proteostasis, redox, mitochondrial metabolism, and facilitates CAMKII-induced DNA binding of Nfat/Mef2/Gata4 to promote myocyte hypertrophy31 at early disease stage (Suppl. Fig 3c). Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor which is only seen in mutant-MyHC cardiomyocytes could potentiate myocyte hypertrophy in MyHC-mutant hearts (Suppl. Fig 3d).

Profibrotic gene programs are selectively activated in mutant TnT fibroblasts at early disease stage:

Iterative clustering identified three cardiac fibroblast subpopulations (C21-23). Cluster C22 (Fig 3a) was the largest (7811 nuclei) and showed the highest expression of activated fibroblast marker genes (e.g. Col8a1, Postn, Col3a1, Col1a1, Thbs1), but only in mutant-TnT fibroblasts (Suppl. Fig 4a, b). Hence, we focused our analysis on this fibroblast cluster. Fibroblasts in the C22 cluster showed 531 commonly upregulated genes in both mutants; 1455 genes were only upregulated in mutant-TnT fibroblasts, and 25 genes were only upregulated in mutant-MyHC; very few genes were downregulated (Fig 3b, Suppl Fig 4c–f). Mutant-TnT fibroblasts had signatures of activated fibrosis signaling by IPA (Fig 3c), and upregulation of several genes (e.g. Col3a1, Col1a2, Tgfbr1-3, Smad 3–4, Tcf4) and TFs (e.g. Ep300, Foxp2, Crebbp, Tcf7l1/2), associated with pro-fibrotic TGFβ and Wnt signaling pathways (Fig 3d, e).

Analysis of C22 ATAC-seq data revealed increased chromatin accessibility for 40,567 and 21,287 features, and decreased accessibility for 58,030 and 21,287 features in mutant TnT and MyHC fibroblasts, respectively (Suppl Fig 4g–h). Motif enrichment analysis using ArchR predicted enrichment for several CEBP family members, PGR and NR3C1 in both mutants, with a stronger response in mutant-TnT (Fig 3f). The greatest differences between both mutants and controls (by SCENIC and ArchR analyses) were observed for Foxp2, Tcf7l1, Creb3l2, Srebf2 regulons (Fig 3g–i). These regulons are enriched for biologic processes such as focal adhesion, glycosaminoglycan synthesis, protein synthesis/ER processing/degradation (Fig 3j), and signaling pathways such as MAPK, PI3K-AKT, IGF1, Wnt-β catenin signaling, actin cytoskeletal signaling, FAK signaling, ER stress pathway (Fig 3k).

This data led us to hypothesize that activation of canonical TGFβ signaling via SMADs, and Wnt-β catenin signaling (Fig 3c–d) by P38-MAPK activation (Fig 3j–k) promotes mutant-TnT fibroblast activation. Upregulation of collagen gene expression leads to increase in collagen synthesis which activates ER-localized TFs32, SREBF2 and CREB3L2 (Fig 3h–i), leading to increased collagen secretion and interstitial fibrosis in mutant-TnT hearts (Fig 1e).

Mutant TnT endothelial cells have greater transcriptional dysregulation than mutant MyHC:

Unbiased clustering identified five endothelial cell (EC) clusters (C13-C17) with C14 being the largest EC cluster with 6770 nuclei (Fig 4a) and likely representing arterial ECs – hence we focused our analysis on C14. We observed 292 commonly upregulated genes in both mutants; 297 genes were only upregulated in mutant-TnT, and 51 genes were only upregulated in mutant-MyHC ECs; very few genes were downregulated (Fig 4b, Suppl Fig 5a–d). Both mutant-ECs had signatures of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and focal adhesion, whereas only mutant-TnT ECs showed strong activation of EGFR1 and MAPK signaling pathways (Fig 4c) and associated genes (Fig 4d).

Analysis of C14 ATAC-seq data revealed increased accessibility for 22,526 and 9,436 features, and decreased accessibility for 57,277 and 13,599 features for mutant TnT and MyHC ECs respectively (Suppl. Fig 5e–f). Analysis of differential motif enrichment using ArchR revealed marked differences between the mutant ECs, with an overall stronger response in TnT-mutants, and enrichment for KLF, SP and ZFP family of TFs only in mutant-TnT ECs (Fig 4e). Analysis of differentially-expressed TF genes (Fig 4f) revealed modest upregulation of Klf4, Foxo1 only in mutant-TnT ECs, and Tcf4 in both mutants. The greatest differences between the study groups, identified by SCENIC and ArchR analysis, were observed for Tcf4, Foxo1, Irf1, Klf2, Klf4, Bcl6b regulons (Fig 4g–i). These regulons are enriched for biologic processes such as cell adhesion, cell cycle (Fig 4j). and signaling pathways such as EGFR1, focal adhesion-PI3K-Akt-mTOR, Ras and MAPK (Fig 4k).

In summary, mutant-TnT ECs demonstrate greater dysregulation of gene expression and chromatin accessibility than mutant-MyHC ECs. Our analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data in ECs leads us to hypothesize that hyperdynamic LV function in TnT-mutants increases shear33 and circumferential34 stress in coronaries (Suppl. Fig 6a), which activates integrins35 and kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) – this leads to EGFR transactivation36 (Fig 4c–d), which induces Irf1 (via STAT)37 and Klf2/4 (via ERK, MEF2 phosphorylation)38 (Fig 4e–i, Suppl. Fig 6b). Klf2/4 stimulate NOS-3 (nitric oxide synthase-3) and nitric oxide (NO) generation and inhibit EC activation/proliferation. Furthermore, activation of Irf1 can inhibit angiogenesis39. Taken together, this data could explain our clinical perfusion PET-imaging results of high myocardial blood flow at rest in HCM patients3, and pathology studies suggesting mismatch between myocardial mass and coronary vasculature2 (which contributes to microvascular ischemia and angina3 in HCM).

Mutant TnT vascular smooth muscle cells have greater dysregulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling when compared to mutant MyHC:

Unbiased clustering identified three vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) clusters, C18-20. We analyzed the largest cluster, C20 (Fig 5a) with 2622 nuclei. Similar to other cell types, we observed greater dysregulation of gene expression in mutant-TnT, when compared to mutant-MyHC VSMCs (Fig 5b–c). The DEGs in mutant-TnT VSMCs were enriched for biologic processes such as focal adhesion, inositol mediated signaling, regulation of EC migration, whereas mutant-MyHC ECs showed enrichment for morphogenesis and filament sliding (Fig 5d). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) predicted activation of fibrosis signaling in both mutants, and NO signaling only in mutant-TnT VSMCs (Fig 5e). Modest upregulation of a few genes in the PDGF signaling pathway (GO) was seen, with greater changes in mutant-TnT when compared to mutant-MyHC VSMCs (Fig 5f).

Analysis of ATACs-seq data revealed that 28,862 and 14,646 features were more accessible, whereas 47,400 and 15,317 were less accessible in the mutant TnT and MyHC VSMCs respectively (Fig 5g). TF motif enrichment analysis predicted marked differences between the mutants with agreement only for PBX3, NFYA, CPHX, and PGR (Fig 5h). Since the C20-VSMC cluster is small, regulon analysis could not be carried out reliably. TF-footprinting revealed increased binding for CPHX, PBX3, NYFA motifs in both mutant VSMCs, and stronger binding for NR3C1, PGR motifs only in mutant-MyHC VSMCs (Fig 5i).

Cardiac macrophages in mutant TnT demonstrate greater transcriptional dysregulation than mutant MyHC:

Unbiased clustering identified 5 leukocyte clusters (C1-5), of which C2 was the largest (3657 nuclei) and represented macrophages (Fig 6a). We found 294 commonly upregulated genes in both mutants; 580 genes were only upregulated in mutant-TnT macrophages, and 18 genes were only upregulated in mutant-MyHC; very few genes were downregulated (Fig 6b, Suppl Fig 7a–d). Gene ontology analysis revealed that DEGs in both mutants were enriched for biologic processes related to the actin cytoskeleton, endocytic vesicle, intracellular membrane bound organelle (Fig 6c); upregulation of genes involved in phagosome formation/maturation and phagocytosis was more prominent in mutant-TnT macrophages, when compared to mutant-MyHC (Fig 6d).

Analysis of ATAC-seq data revealed increased accessibility of 39,146 and 24,852 features, and decreased accessibility of 92,653 and 37,637 features for TnT and MyHC mutants respectively (Suppl Fig. 7e–f). Analysis of differential motif enrichment using ArchR revealed marked differences between the 2 mutants, with modest enrichment for KLF, SP, STAT2, CEBP family of TFs only in TnT-mutant macrophages (Fig 6e). Analysis of TF gene expression revealed modest upregulation of Mitf, Irf2, Pbx3 in both mutants, with mutant-TnT macrophages demonstrating greater upregulation than mutant-MyHC. Regulons with the greatest differences between mutants and controls were observed for Irf 2/4/5/9, Nr3c1, Stat2 and Mitf (Fig 6g–j), which were enriched for biologic processes such as endocytosis, phagocytosis, cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, phagosome, and signaling pathways such as RIG/NOD-like receptor, NFkb, JAK-STAT, chemokine signaling pathways (Fig 6k).

In summary, analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data led us to hypothesize that resident macrophages in mutant hearts have a transcriptional profile that is closer to M1 polarization than M2, with mutant-TnT macrophages showing greater changes than mutant-MyHC (Suppl. Fig 8a). Based on our previous data showing mitochondrial dysfunction in TnT-mutants at early disease stage15, this data suggests that macrophages could play an important role in clearance of damaged mitochondria and other debris from ventricular cardiomyocytes40 (Suppl. Fig 8b). Damaged organelles (DAMPs) are recognized by macrophage pattern recognition receptors, leading to upregulation of NF-κB and IRF5 which are pro-inflammatory41. In this study, we did not observe significant upregulation of cytokine gene expression (Fig 6D), which we attribute to activation of the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1, which can block the pro-inflammatory effects42 of NFκB and IRF activation (Suppl. Fig 8c).

Cell-Cell communication Analysis:

Mutant sarcomeric proteins are only expressed in cardiac myocytes, but all cardiac cell types demonstrate chromatin remodeling and changes in gene expression at early disease stage, suggesting the role of paracrine signaling. We used CellChat to examine intercellular communications and predict autocrine/paracrine signaling in mutant and control hearts. Cellchat predicts intercellular communication and signaling pathways, based on the expression of ligand-receptor pairs. Our analysis of RNA-seq data using CellChat revealed an overall increase in intercellular communications in both mutant hearts when compared to controls, with mutant-TnT demonstrating the greatest changes (Fig 7a). These changes were due to stronger interactions between ventricular cardiomyocytes (C9), ECs (C14, C16) and fibroblasts (C21, C22) in mutant hearts, when compared to controls (Suppl Fig 10a). The mutant-TnT heart was highly enriched for ephrin B (which can influence diastolic function43), and pro-fibrotic periostin, TGFβ signaling, whereas mutant-MyHC showed marked enrichment for pro-hypertrophic44 neuregulin signaling (Fig 7b–c). PDGF and ANGPT signaling were predicted to be stronger in mutant-TnT, whereas VEGF signaling was similar in both mutants (Fig 7b).

Next, we assessed disease-specific intercellular communications that are only identified in one or both mutants and not present in controls (Suppl Fig 9b–e). Upregulation of several ligand-receptor pairs/signaling, including NPR1, VCAM, NOTCH, EGF, IGF were only present in mutant hearts. Furthermore, only mutant-TnT showed expression of galectin, and pro-fibrotic ligands/signaling, including FN1, EDA, Wnt, ITGB2, BMP10, EDN (Suppl Fig 9b–e).

Analysis of outgoing communication from cardiomyocytes was performed to assess genotype-specific cellular crosstalk: antihypertrophic45 natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (NPR1) and vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM) were specific to mutant myocytes and not seen in controls (Suppl Fig 10a–b), whereas cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (GAS) was specific to mutant-TnT myocytes (Suppl Fig 10c, Fig 7b), and Agrin (AGRN) was specific to mutant-MyHC myocytes (Suppl Fig 10d). Interestingly, endothelin (EDN) signaling was only predicted to be activated in mutant-TnT, with the fibroblast cluster C21 as the source, and cardiomyocytes (C6-9) as recipients (Suppl. Fig 10e).

Taken together, our analysis of cell-cell communication in mutant TnT and MyHC hearts at early disease stage, reveals similar dysregulation of signaling pathways in mutant myocytes, and selective activation of pro-fibrotic pathways in mutant-TnT.

DISCUSSION

We examined transcriptional regulation of cardiac phenotypic heterogeneity in early stage HCM by analysis of single nuclei isolated from 2 HCM mouse models with distinct cardiac phenotypes, using linked snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq. Since mutant sarcomeric proteins are only expressed in cardiomyocytes, we hypothesized that these pathogenic variants in Tnnt2 and Myh6 induce large, genotype-specific transcriptional changes in cardiomyocytes, as well as paracrine signaling from ventricular cardiomyocytes, that lead to differences in LV mass, cardiac mechanics and fibrosis at early disease stage. Our multiome analysis revealed similar transcriptional landscapes and activation of chromatin remodeler complexes (SWI/SNF, ISWI) in mutant ventricular cardiomyocytes and marked differences in gene expression and chromatin remodeling in cardiac fibroblasts, macrophages ECs, VSMCs, at early disease stage, suggesting an important role for non-myocyte cells in phenotypic heterogeneity in HCM. Contrary to our original hypothesis, ventricular cardiomyocytes were not predicted to drive dysregulated signaling pathways in fibroblasts, ECs or VSMCs.

Cardiac HCM phenotype:

The pathologic hallmarks of HCM are myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, microvascular remodeling. Clinically, HCM patients are classified into 3 hemodynamic groups, namely, obstructive, non-obstructive and labile obstructive, based on the presence/absence of LV obstruction at rest/provocation46. In each hemodynamic group, the location and extent of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, coronary microvascular dysfunction is very variable, even in individuals expressing the same pathogenic variant. But very little is known about the molecular mechanisms driving phenotypic variability in human HCM, because of lack of availability of human heart tissue at early disease stage.

Myocyte Ca2+ handling can influence cardiac HCM phenotype:

Abnormalities in myocyte Ca2+ handling are common in HCM, and can lead to changes in systolic/diastolic function, as well as activation of pro-hypertrophic calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CAMKII) signaling (Suppl Fig 3c). Our analysis of snRNA-seq data revealed upregulation of several genes implicated in Ca2+ signaling47 (Camk2d, Ryr2, Prkca) in both mutant ventricular cardiomyocytes, which could promote myocyte hypertrophy47 (Fig 2d). Prior studies in R403Q-MyHC mutant-myocytes demonstrate reduced SR-Ca2+ stores without changes in diastolic Ca2+ or Ca2+ transients at 4 weeks of age48, which could explain our echocardiography results of similar LV systolic and diastolic function at 5 weeks of age. In contrast, the R92W-TnT variant causes increased myofilament Ca2+sensitivity, which is predicted to increase myofilament Ca2+binding, resulting in greater cytosolic Ca2+buffering, lower peak systolic Ca2+, higher peak tension, slower myofilament Ca2+dissociation, higher diastolic calcium49, positive inotropy and negative lusitropy49. These computer modeling results are confirmed by prior Ca2+ transient measurements in isolated R92W-TnT myocytes50 and could explain our echocardiography results of higher LVEF and diastolic dysfunction, in mutant-TnT hearts. Interestingly, cardiac myocytes isolated from R92W-TnT hearts have been reported to exhibit shorter baseline sarcomere lengths than controls, and patients expressing this pathogenic variant have mild or no cardiac hypertrophy at early disease stage. At the cellular level, increase in cardiomyocyte size is thought to be the main contributor to increase in LV mass51, because adult cardiomyocytes comprise ~70–80% of heart mass and have little mitotic potential. Hence, smaller baseline mutant myocyte size in R92W-TnT, which has been attributed to higher basal Ca2+-associated activation, likely contributes to smaller heart size observed in TnT-mutant mice despite activation of hypertrophic signaling pathways and TFs.

Myocyte hypertrophy:

Since myocyte hypertrophy is a hallmark of HCM, we used our integrated snATAC-seq and snRNA-seq data from ventricular cardiomyocytes, to gain insights into the transcriptional regulation of LVH in early stage HCM. We identified large transcriptional changes in ventricular cardiomyocytes, and pathway analysis predicted activation of cardiac hypertrophy in both mutants (Fig 2c). Both mutant ventricular-cardiomyocytes demonstrated upregulation of genes encoding several pro-hypertrophic TFs (Fig 2f) and kinases such as Camk2d, Rock2, Prkca, Akap6. (Fig 2 d, f). Cellchat analysis of RNA-seq data predicted incoming pro-hypertrophic IGF signaling (from C1/C2) only in mutant ventricular-cardiomyocytes, which could activate MAPK signaling and induce transcription of early response genes Fos, Jun (Suppl Fig 3b). Induced Fos and Jun proteins (AP-1 TFs)52 have been demonstrated to function as pioneer TFs by binding nucleosomal DNA, and recruiting the chromatin remodeler complexes (SWI/SNF, ISWI)29, 51 to open chromatin and trigger transcription of late response genes that lead to the molecular cardiac phenotype (characterized by activation of the fetal gene program51, changes in mitochondrial function, metabolism, redox). Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes regulate genomic architecture by using energy from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt contact between DNA and histones, leading to nucleosome disassembly29. The mammalian SWI/SNF complex consists of 4 core subunits: one of 2 ATPase subunits, BRM (Smarca2) or BRG1 (Smarca4), BAF155 (Smarcc1), BAF170 (Smarcc2) and INI1/SNF5/BAF47 (Smarcb1)53. Our analysis of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq data, TF-footprinting, regulon analysis (Fig 2e–j) support activation of AP-1 TFs and chromatin remodeler complexes (Fig 2e–h) in early stage HCM. Prior studies in experimental models51, 54 reveal the importance of BRG1 (Smarca4) in pathologic cardiac hypertrophy54. BRG1 (Smarca4) is silenced in adult cardiac myocytes, but reactivated by cardiac stresses such as increased afterload resulting from TAC (transverse aortic constriction) or hypertension54, leading to the formation of SWI/SNF complexes that remodel chromatin, activate the fetal cardiac gene program54 and promote cardiac remodeling. An immunohistochemical study of BRG1 expression in human heart tissue revealed higher BRG1 expression in HCM than DCM, and other causes of LVH55. Our regulon analysis predicted Smarca4 regulon activation in mutant ventricular cardiomyocytes but not in control cardiomyoctes (Fig 2h). Smarca4 regulon genes were enriched for signaling pathways/biologic processes such as MAPK signaling, IGF1 signaling, mTOR signaling, FAK signaling, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, protein processing in ER, lysosome (Fig 2 k,l). Taken together, our data in 2 HCM mouse models, and human HCM heart data suggest that the SWI/SNF complex is a therapeutic target for preventing cardiac remodeling in early-stage HCM.

Fibrosis:

Interstitial fibrosis is common in HCM4, 56, 57 and increases risk for heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death58. Our histology results in R92W-TnT hearts, and a clinical study showing biomarkers of increased collagen synthesis in pathogenic variant carriers59 indicate that fibrosis can predate LVH. But the transcriptional mechanisms whereby expression of mutant sarcomeric proteins in cardiomyocytes leads to fibroblast activation and interstitial fibrosis are unclear.

Under normal physiologic conditions, fibroblasts comprise 15–24% of heart cells, and provide structural support by regulating the synthesis and degradation of ECM proteins57. Following TGFβ stimulation, fibroblasts proliferate and differentiate into myofibroblasts that express alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and increase expression of fibrillar collagens I/III, periostin and PDGFRa60. Prior studies in mouse hearts61 suggest activation of the TGFβ signaling pathway is important in generation of cardiac fibrosis in HCM. In our study, IPA predicted activation of fibrosis and FAK signaling only in mutant-TnT fibroblasts, which also demonstrated modest upregulation of several myofibroblast marker genes (Suppl. Fig 4a).

To expand our understanding of cardiac fibroblast activation and early onset of interstitial fibrosis in TnT-mutant hearts, we examined expression of genes and TFs involved in the pro-fibrotic TGFβ and Wnt signaling pathways in C22 fibroblasts which are likely to be the main effectors of interstitial fibrosis in mutant-TnT hearts, by virtue of being the largest fibroblast cluster. Mutant-TnT C22 fibroblasts demonstrated upregulation of incoming growth factor signaling (IGF, EGF, FGF, PDGF) and increased expression of several genes/TFs involved in the pro-fibrotic TGFβ and Wnt signaling pathways, but TGFβ gene (Tgfb1-3) expression was unchanged (Fig 3c, d, Suppl. Fig 9d). Our Cellchat analysis predicted strong activation of profibrotic periostin and TGFβ signaling only in mutant-TnT C22 fibroblasts; the source of TGFβ signaling was predicted to be C21-fibroblasts, C17-ECs, C8-cardiomyocytes, C10-epicardial cells and C1-leukocytes (Fig 7b, c). In contrast, in mutant-MyHC hearts, activation of TGFβ signaling was only predicted in C2-macrophages, with C11-epicardial cells as the source – this could explain lack of interstitial fibrosis in mutant-MyHC hearts at early-disease stage.

TGFβ is known to be secreted in its latent form and stored in ECM62. Stimulation of canonical TGFβ-SMAD signaling in fibroblasts requires activation of TGFβ prior to binding to dimeric TGFβ receptors. Prior studies suggest that, activate FAK, and canonical TGFβ-SMAD signaling which in turn can stimulate Wnt-β catenin signaling63 (Suppl. Fig 11). Abnormal cardiac mechanics (diastolic dysfunction, higher LVEF) in mutant-TnT but not mutant-MyHC at early disease stage could contribute to activation of pro-fibrotic signaling in mutant-TnT hearts, by stimulating release of active TGFβ ligand from ECM, which then binds TGFβ receptors in C22 fibroblasts, to promote collagen synthesis and interstitial fibrosis by activation of canonical TGFβ-signaling (via SMADs)64 and Wnt-βCatenin signaling65 (Suppl. Fig 11). Our data suggests that restoration of cardiac biomechanics (e,g, with cardiac myosin ATPase inhibitors66) could be antifibrotic in HCM patients with hyperdynamic LV systolic function, diastolic dysfunction and early activation of pro-fibrotic signaling pathways.

Conclusions

Bioinformatics analysis of linked single nucleus RNA-/ATAC-seq data in two HCM mouse models predicts that ventricular myocyte hypertrophy is driven by activation of AP1 transcription factors, chromatin remodeler complexes (SWI/SNF, ISWI) and growth factor signaling pathways. Genotype-specific effects of mutant sarcomeric proteins on myofilament Ca2+sensitivity and cardiac mechanics, as well as intercellular communications from non-myocyte cells underlies phenotypic heterogeneity in HCM.

MATERIALS and METHODS

All procedures involving the handling and care of mice were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of California San Francisco, and adhered to the National Institutes of Health Public Health Service guidelines.

Transgenic Mouse Models:

The R92W-TnT+/- male mouse breeders were kindly provided by Dr. Jill Tardiff (University of Arizona), and the R403Q-αMyHC+/- male mouse breeders were kindly provided by Dr. Leslie Leinwand (University of Colorado Boulder). The R92W-TnT mouse is an F1 cross between FVB/N and C57/Bl6 strains17, and the R403Q-αMyHC were generated in CBA/B16 (F1 cross) mice18. The R92W-TnT+/- and R403Q-MyHC+/- mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6N (Charles River) for >10 generations. Male mice were weaned and genotyped at the age of 4 weeks by PCR-amplified tail DNA as described previously15. All studies were conducted at 5 weeks of age.

Histology:

Hearts were harvested, extracardiac vessels were trimmed and incubated in 4% PFA for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by 30% sucrose solution overnight. Subsequently, hearts were embedded in OCT and frozen at −80°C. Frozen hearts were sliced using a cryotome to generate slices of 10 µm thickness, and mounted onto glass slides. Slides were kept at −20°C until staining. Picrosirius red staining was used for quantification of fibrosis (cardiac collagen). Sections were stained with solution I (0.01% fast green FCF (Sigma, F7252) in saturated picric acid) for 1 hour, followed by solution II (0.04% fast green FCF/0.1% Sirius red (Sigma, Direct Red 80: 365548) in saturated picric acid) for 1 hour. Subsequently, sections were washed with acidified water (0.5% acetic acid), dehydrated with 100% ethanol, cleared with xylene, and mounted with DPX permanent mounting media. Stained sections were imaged under bright-field microscopy using a Leica DM6 microscope at 10x magnification. Fibrosis was quantified using ImageJ 1.53t (https://imagej.net/ij/docs/examples/stained-sections/index.html).

Echocardiography:

Cardiac phenotyping was performed by echocardiography, using a Vevo 3100 platform and MX550D 40Mhz probe (VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada). Five-week-old R92W-TnT and R403Q-MyHC mice and littermate controls were anesthetized using inhaled isoflurane (3 v/v% for induction and 0.5–1% v/v% for maintenance). Parasternal long (PLSAX) images were recorded in B-mode and M-mode. To evaluate diastolic function, pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler of mitral valve (MV) inflow, tissue Doppler imaging and left atrial (LA) area were recorded using the apical 4-chamber view. Heart rate was maintained at >450 bpm during recording of systolic parameters, and >400 bpm during recording of parameters reflecting diastolic function. Data was analyzed using the Vevo Image Lab Software (Version 5.6.0, VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada). Echocardiographic measurements were averaged from at least 3 separate cardiac cycles. Statistical Analysis was carried out using the R (version 4.1.0) package tidyverse (2.0.0) gtsummary (version 1.4.1).

Single nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq

Nuclei isolation:

Five-week-old R92W-TnT and T403Q-MyHC mutant mice and littermate controls were imaged by echocardiography 2–4 days prior to nuclei isolation. Mutant and littermate control mice (n=4) were anaesthetized with isoflurane (3%), and euthanized by cervical dislocation. The chest cavity was opened and the heart was quickly excised along with connecting vessels, and washed in ice-cold PBS. The right and left atrial appendages, right and left ventricles were excised, cut into 1 mm3-sized pieces in ice-cold PBS, transferred to a 50ml conical tube containing ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged at 500g for 2 minutes at 4°C. Heart tissue pieces were resuspended in 2 ml of Lysis Buffer (Sucrose 1M, Tri-HCl pH=8 10mM, Magnesium Acetate 5mM, DTT 1mM, Triton-X 0.2%, Halt Protease Inhibitors Cocktail 1x, Rnase OUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor 200U/ml, Nuclease-free H2O) in a 7.5 ml Dounce homogenizer (on ice), and homogenized to release nuclei from heart tissue. The lysate was filtered and centrifuged at 1000G for 8 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 1ml Nucleic-Buffer (Sucrose 440mM, Tri-HCl pH=7.2 10mM, Potassium Chloride 70mM, Magnesium Chloride 5mM, Spermidine 1,5mM, Halt Protease Inhibitors Cocktail 1x, Rnase OUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor 200U/ml, Nuclease-free H2O), filtered and centrifuged at 1000G for 5 minutes at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 10XGenomics 1x Nuclear-Buffer for subsequent steps. A final count with a target concentration of 3000–8000 Nuclei/ml was obtained for library preparation, which was performed using the 10X Genomics Multiome Protocol (Fig 1B). Library preparation of all samples was performed in parallel. A total 50,179 nuclei passed quality control using the Cellranger Arc pipeline across all 4 experimental conditions. All four samples were sequenced together.

Sequencing and Postprocessing:

Sequencing of ATAC and RNA-seq libraries was performed on an S4 lane of a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer, using the 10X Genomics Multiome Protocol. Fastq files were processed using Cell Ranger ARC. Cell Ranger ARC count was run on a local cluster using an MM10 reference genome. Preliminary quality control, assessment of cell number, number of high-quality fragments and genes per cell was determined by Cell Ranger ARC. The filtered feature and ATAC fragment files were used for subsequent analysis (Fig 1B).

Data Analysis:

All Multiome datasets were loaded and integrated into one project using ArchR. ArchR Doublet scoring was run on the unfiltered dataset and determined doublets were removed. LSI-Dimensionality-Reduction was carried out for the ATAC and gene expression datasets separately. Subsequently ATAC and GENEX dimensions were integrated, Harmony was run on the combined dimension, and grouped by sample. UMAP projections were added for all dimensionality reductions with a minimal distance of 0.8. Clusters were determined using the Harmony dimensionality reduction, with a resolution of 1.2. Clusters were limited to 25 by Seurat-based ArchR Clustering. Pseudo bulking for subsequent analysis was performed using the AddCoverages method. Clustering and Embeddings were exported to Seurat for subsequent analysis.

Cluster Identity:

Established cell markers, gene expression and gene score (derived from chromatin-accessibility) were employed to identify cell populations in each cluster. The marker genes used are as follows: cardiomyocytes (Mhrt, Tnnt2, Myh6, ANP, BNP), fibroblasts (Col5a1, Tcf21, Pdgfra, Col3a1), endothelial cells (PECAM1), vascular smooth muscle cells (Mylk, Rgs5), epicardial cells (Msln, Upk3b, Gpm6a, Upk1b(7,8)), endocardial cells (Vwf, Igf2, H19), macrophages (Vsig4, C1qa), monocytes (CD14, CEBPB), B cells (Pax5, MS4A1), T cells (CD8A, CCL5, CD3D, Tbx21, IL7R). Next, we examined differential gene expression in each cluster. Gene expression analysis: All separate datasets were integrated using the Seurat (4.0.6) Merge function, normalized and scaled after merging. Differential gene expression was determined using FindMarkers with the DESeq algorithm comparing the mutant groups to WT. Differential gene expression of both mutant groups was compared using GOPlot (1.0.2) and Venn diagrams were generated. Cell lysis leads to release of mRNA that contaminate the nuclei preparation; these mRNA can be included in the gel-bead, barcoded and sequenced. To address mRNA contamination, raw gene expression reads were analyzed using the Soup-X package (1.5.2)67. A contamination fraction of rho = 0.2 was set across all samples to account for differences, and prevent introduction of bias. Subsequent analysis was done using a normalized count matrix filtered using Soup-X. Soup-X determines the contamination fraction based on clustering provided by the Cell Ranger ARC pipeline; genes that were identified in all clusters are considered contaminants – these reads are subtracted across all cells.

Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA):

Differential Gene expression data for both mutants and the relevant clusters was uploaded to the Qiagen IPA system (version 70750971 (Release Date: 2021-10-22), QIAGEN Inc., https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/IPA). The mouse genome was used as a reference. All cell types and data sources that were not related to the heart were excluded, and only genes with FDR p<0.05 were considered in the downstream analysis. Activated pathways were screened and bar plots showing the 10 most up- and down-regulated pathways are shown. For canonical pathway analysis, −logP >1.3 was used as the cutoff; a z-score > or < 2 was used as the cutoff for significant pathway activation or inhibition.

ATAC analysis:

Additional analysis of ATAC data was performed using ArchR (1.0.1)68 as described (10). Based on the calculated gene score, marker features were obtained and differential marker feature analysis was performed to determine differential accessibility between both mutants and littermate controls (WT). Gene tracks for multiple genes were obtained. Reproducible peaks were identified using MACS2, and a peak matrix was established. After establishing a robust peak set, we sought to predict which transcription factors (TF) drive changes in gene expression in each mutant. Motif annotations from the cisdb database were added to the peak set in ArchR, and differential testing between the mutants and WT was carried out using chromVAR to find enriched TF motifs in mutants. Only motifs with FDR p< 0.01 were considered for final analysis.

SCENIC analysis and cross-validation of identified transcription factor binding motifs:

To evaluate drivers of gene expression in a single cell dataset, the SCENIC pipeline69 was developed to identify Regulons (defined as genes co-expressed with a TF factor that drives their expression). The SCENIC pipeline consists of multiple steps, based on previously published tools69. SCENIC uses gene expression data of a single-cell dataset to infer gene regulatory networks. In a first step using Genie3, a machine-learning based approach, co-expression of TFs and their respective putative candidate targets is predicted. Based on this data, RcisTarget is used to identify whether the potential regulators’ TF DNA-binding motif is significantly over-represented 500bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of the genes of interest. Thus, regulons are built by integrating data from both steps (TF with predicted target genes). Using AUCell the gene set ‘activity’ in each cell is calculated through enrichment of the regulon as an area under the curve (AUC) across all genes in a cell based on their ranked expression value. Based on this the relative regulon activity is calculated for each cell group. Regulon activity per cell group is compared to the other cell groups (Suppl Fig 12). For each cluster both mutants and controls are compared, and differentially-activated regulons are determined. To validate putative driving TFs, enriched TF motifs from the ATAC data obtained in the ArchR workflow were cross-referenced with activated regulons (Fig 1B). Z-Score for both datasets were calculated, and a combined Z-Score (Mean of both z-scores) was generated to identify matching TFs - this cross-validation was used to identify TFs that drive cell phenotype.

CellChat Analysis:

While analyzing differences between groups for an individual cell type renders useful information, cell-cell-interactions are often much more difficult to study. Single nucleus datasets derived from a single heart permit investigation of interactions between several different cell populations, without cell dissociation. CellChat is an R package that uses predefined clustering of the single-cell/nuclei datasets to infer cell-cell-communication using ligand-receptor-pairing based on gene expression in all cells70. A database with ligand-receptor interaction and their heteromeric complexes has been established and can be leveraged to predict interaction strength, pathways and signaling connections. Using laws of mass action quantification of communication probability is estimated. We used the analysis pipeline that was described in a recent publication70. Individual analysis was followed by differential analysis between three groups (2 mutants and littermate controls). Interactions were weighted to the number of nuclei in the respective cluster.

Statistics

Welch’s t-test was used to compare the echocardiography and histological data of mutants with their respective littermate controls (WT); p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Single-cell analysis was performed using Seurat, EnrichR, SCENIC for the RNAseq data and ArchR for the ATACseq data. Comparisons were made between the respective mutants and pooled littermate controls. ArchR’s getMarkerFeatures68 was used with Wilcoxon test. A false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05 and a Log2FC ≥ 1 were deemed relevant for differential peak accessibility, and FDR ≤ 0.01 and a MeanDiff ≥ 0.1 were deemed relevant for motif accessibility. Differential gene expression was determined in Seurat using the FindMarkers function with the DESeq2 algorithm. Genes with an adjusted p< 0.05 based on Bonferroni correction were deemed significantly dysregulated.

Using the differentially-expressed genes in the 2 mutants, we performed Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), or Wikipathways, or Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis to identify molecular processes that are perturbed/activated, in each cell type. For IPA canonical pathway analysis, a −log (P value) >1.3 was taken as the cutoff. A z-score >2 was defined as the cutoff for significant activation, and z-score < −2 was defined as the cutoff for significant downregulation. For pathway enrichment analysis, only DEGs with adjusted p < 0.01 were used in the analysis. Pathways with adjusted p<0.25 using the Benjamini-Hochberg method were considered for analysis. For the integrated analysis of regulon activity and motif accessibility, a combined z score was calculated from the z scores of the individual assays. For the regulon-gene pathway analysis, only matches with at least 2 overlapping genes in the respective regulon and pathways were considered. Matches were deemed significant if p < 0.01, using Fisher’s exact test.

RNA-seq: Top 10 pathways predicted to be enriched by GO Cellular Component pathway analysis using all DEGs. Activation of endocytosis and phagocytosis was predicted in both mutants, with more genes matching in the TnT mutant. d. RNA-seq: Heatmap for DEGs for phagosome formation, maturation, endocytosis, FC receptor-mediated phagocytosis show greater upregulation in mutant TnT. Cytokine gene expression analysis showed a small statistically significant upregulation of IL-15 gene expression in mutant TnT macrophages. (Red dots represent DEGs with adj p<0.01); all DEGs in GO genesets for phagosome formation, maturation, endocytosis, Fc phagocytosis, cytokine genes are presented in the heat maps. e. ATAC-seq: Top 30 differentially-accessible TF motifs (FDR ≤ 0.05) in mutants compared to WT. Marked differences are seen between mutants; 6/30 TF motifs, including PBX3, NFYA, CPHX showed higher accessibility in both mutants, with greater changes in mutant TnT when compared to mutant MyHC. f. RNA-seq: Heatmap of differentially-expressed TF genes (adj p<0.05) identified by chromatin accessibility analysis, regulon analysis shows greater activation in mutant TnT when compared to mutant MyHC. g. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq: Integration of motif accessibility and regulon activity showing the combined (average) z-score shows z >1.2 for Pbx3 in both mutants; Stat2 and several Irf family members were only seen in mutant TnT. h. RNA-seq: Regulon activity analysis shows activation of several Irf family members (Irf2, 4, 5, 9), Stat2, Rel, Nr3c1, Mitf in both mutants with higher z-score in mutant TnT. i, j. RNA-seq: Scatter-plot and heatmaps of regulon genes in both mutants show greater upregulation in mutant TnT. (Red dots represent differentially-expressed regulon genes with adj p<0.01). Top 30 differentially expressed regulon genes are presented in the heat maps. k. RNA-seq: Regulon-Geneset comparison using KEGG with strength of interaction shown by number of matched genes shows that Irf5 is most influential for endocytosis and FC gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis.

Figure 7. Prediction of cellular crosstalk by CellChat.

Cell Chat uses RNA-seq data to infer ligand-receptor-pairings between different clusters which reflects paracrine and autocrine signaling. a. Higher numbers of interactions are predicted in cells from mutant TnT (12070) and mutant MyHC (6503), when compared to controls (4691). b. Pathway distance plot (grey bars) shows the difference in pathway activity between mutants and controls. Bar length reflects the degree of difference in the pathway activity between the two, with longer bars reflecting greater difference in pathway activity. The adjacent plot shows direct comparison of the information flow in each mutant, compared to controls. c. Cell-Cell-Signaling for selected pathways. Darker green indicates greater importance. Sender expresses the ligand and receivers express the receptor. Mediators and receivers influence the signaling but are not directly involved in signaling.
