10.1186/s12935-020-01693-y.

The Editor in Chief has retracted this article. Following publication concerns were raised regarding a number of figures, including but not limited to:

The TMZ 0hr panel in Fig. 2a appears similar to the FDPs 0h panel in Fig. 3 in [1] and the BRD4-KO#1 0h panel in Fig. 2C in [2].

The Vector and CtBP1 bands in Fig. 3B appear similar to U251 Vector and b-catenin bands in Fig. 6G in [3] and p62 and b-actin blots in Fig. 3B in [4].

The p-62 u87/TMZ-R in Fig. 3E appears similar to the Mcl-1 CHX blot in Fig. 4C in [5] and the p-PI3K GIST430 in [2].

The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions of this article. The authors did not state explicitly whether they agree to this retraction.
