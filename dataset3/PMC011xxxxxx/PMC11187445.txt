This review emphasizes the significance of unraveling the molecular landscape of MPXV for advancing diagnostic accuracy.

Mechanisms of Viral Entry, Replication, and Spread Within the Host

This review investigates the intricate mechanisms underlying the viral entry, replication, and dissemination of MPXV within the host organism. Upon initial host cell attachment, the virus employs specific molecular interactions, facilitated by viral surface proteins, to gain entry into the host cell. Following entry, the virus undergoes uncoating, liberating its genetic material into the cellular milieu. The subsequent stages involve viral transcription and translation processes, leading to the synthesis of viral structural and non-structural proteins. Viral replication occurs within discrete cellular compartments, contributing to the assembly of mature virions. The dissemination of progeny virions involves intricate interactions with host cell machinery, facilitating their release and subsequent infection of neighboring cells. Understanding these molecular intricacies is paramount for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions to impede viral replication and enhance host immune responses. This review synthesizes current knowledge on these mechanisms, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets and advancing strategies for enhanced Mpox care.
