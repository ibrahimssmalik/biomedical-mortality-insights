Abstract

A Gram-stain-negative, facultative aerobic, catalase- and oxidase-positive, non-motile, non-flagellated, and coccus-shaped bacterium, strain J2-16T, isolated from a marine green alga, was characterized taxonomically. Strain J2-16T grew at 20–40 °C (optimum, 30 °C), pH 6.0–10.0 (optimum, pH 7.0), and 1.0–4.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 3.0 %). Menaquinone-7 was identified as the sole respiratory quinone, and major fatty acids (>5 %) were C18 : 1 ω9c, iso-C14 : 0, C14 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0, C18 : 0, C16 : 0, and C17 : 1 ω8c. The polar lipids of strain J2-16T consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified phospholipids, and three unidentified lipids. The genome size of strain J2-16T was 5384 kb with a G+C content of 52.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene and 120 protein marker sequences revealed that strain J2-16T formed a distinct phyletic lineage within the genus Coraliomargarita, closely related to Coraliomargarita sinensis WN38T and Coraliomargarita akajimensis DSM 45221T with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 95.7 and 94.4 %, respectively. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values between strain J2-16T and Coraliomargarita species were lower than 71.2 and 20.0 %, respectively. The phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and molecular features support that strain J2-16T represents a novel species of the genus Coraliomargarita, for which the name Coraliomargarita algicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is J2-16T (=KACC 22590T=JCM 35407T).

pmcIntroduction

The genus Coraliomargarita was originally classified within the family Puniceicoccaceae of the phylum 'Verrucomicrobia' with Coraliomargarita akajimensis designated as the type species in 2007 [1]. However, recent taxonomic revisions have led to the reclassification of Coraliomargarita members into the new family Coraliomargaritaceae [2]. As of March 2024, the genus comprises only three validly published species: Coraliomargarita sinensis, Coraliomargarita akajimensis, and Coraliomargarita parva (https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/coraliomargarita). Coraliomargarita species have been isolated from marine environments, including seawater [1], mangrove sediment [2], and marine solar saltern [3]. These bacteria are Gram-negative, non-flagellated cocci, containing menaquinone-7 (MK-7) as the major respiratory quinone, C18 : 1 ω9c, iso-C14 : 0, and C14 : 0 as the major fatty acids, genomic DNA G+C contents ranging from 53.6 to 56.0 mol%, and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as major polar lipids [14]. In our investigation of interactions between marine algae and bacteria, we have isolated numerous novel bacteria from the phycosphere of marine algae [510]. In this particular study, we isolated a strain designated as J2-16T, belonging to the genus Coraliomargarita, from a marine green alga. We then analysed its taxonomic characteristics using a polyphasic approach.

Strain isolation

Strain J2-16T was isolated from the phycosphere of a marine green alga, Ulva lactuca, collected from Jajakdo beach (38° 18′ 30″ N 128° 32′ 34″ E) in Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea, as described previously [8]. Initially, the collected green alga was washed using artificial seawater (ASW; 20.0 g NaCl, 2.9 g MgSO4, 4.5 g MgCl2·6H2O, 0.6 g KCl, 1.8 g CaCl2·2H2O per litre) via vortexing. Subsequently, the washed alga was mechanically homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (IKA) for 10 s, followed by serial dilution in ASW. Aliquots of 100 µl from each serial dilution were plated on marine agar (MA; MBcell) and incubated aerobically at 25 °C for 7 days. Colonies grown on MA were subjected to PCR amplification of their 16S rRNA gene using universal primers F1 (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and R13 (5′-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) [8]. The resulting PCR amplicons were double-digested with restriction enzymes HaeIII and HhaI, and their restriction fragment patterns were analysed on a 2 % agarose gel. Representative amplicons with distinct fragment patterns were sequenced using the universal 340F (5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) primer [8] at Macrogen (Seoul, Republic of Korea). The obtained 16S rRNA gene sequences were compared with the sequences of all validly published type species available in the EzBioCloud server (www.ezbiocloud.net/identify) [11]. Based on the results, strain J2-16T was selected for further taxonomic characterizations as a putative novel species of the genus Coraliomargarita. Strain J2-16T was routinely cultivated aerobically on MA at 30 °C for 3 days and stored at −80 °C in marine broth (MB; MBcell) containing 15 % (v/v) glycerol. For comparison of phenotypic properties and fatty acid compositions, the type strains C. sinensis KCTC 62602T and C. akajimensis KCTC 12865T were obtained from their culture collection centres and used as reference strains.

16S rRNA gene phylogeny

The 16S rRNA gene amplicon of strain J2-16T, generated by F1 and R13 primers, was subsequently sequenced using universal 16S rRNA gene primers 518R (5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′) and 805F (5′-GATTAGATACCCTGGTAGTC-3′) [7]. Through assembly of sequences obtained from 340F, 518R, and 805F primer-based sequencing, a nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain J2-16T (1478 nucleotides) was obtained. Alignment of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain J2-16T and closely related valid type strains was conducted using the fast secondary-structure-aware infernal aligner [12]. Phylogenetic trees, incorporating bootstrap values (1000 replications), were reconstructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ), maximum-likelihood (ML), and maximum-parsimony (MP) algorithms with the Kimura two-parameter model, the nearest-neighbour-interchange heuristic search method, and pairwise deletion options, respectively, implemented in the mega11 software [13].

The comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain J2-16T exhibited the closest relationships with C. sinensis WN38T and C. akajimensis DSM 45221T, with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 95.7 and 94.4 %, respectively. These values fell below the species differentiation threshold of 98.7 % [14], indicating that strain J2-16T likely represents a novel species. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences using the NJ algorithm demonstrated that strain J2-16T formed a distinct phyletic lineage with members of the genus Coraliomargarita, supported by a bootstrap value of 100 % (Fig. 1). Phylogenetic trees reconstructed using the ML and MP algorithms also supported the placement of strain J2-16T within the genus Coraliomargarita (Fig. S1, available in the online version of this article). These combined comparative and phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences suggest that strain J2-16T may be classified as a novel species within the genus Coraliomargarita.

Genome features

The genomic DNA of strain J2-16T was extracted from cells cultured in MB using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and sequenced using an Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer (ONT). The resulting sequencing reads of strain J2-16T were de novo-assembled using Unicycler (version 0.4.7) [15]. The quality of the assembled genome was assessed for completeness and contamination rates using CheckM2 software (version 1.0.2) [16]. The complete genome sequence of strain J2-16T was deposited in GenBank under the accession number CP138858 and annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline [17]. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the genomes of strain J2-16T and closely related type strains. The amino acid sequences of 120 bacterial marker proteins were extracted from these genomes, concatenated, and aligned using the Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit (GTDB-Tk) [18]. A phylogenomic tree, incorporating bootstrap values (1000 replications), was reconstructed based on the ML algorithm using mega11 software. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values among the genomes of strain J2-16T, C. sinensis WN38T, and C. akajimensis DSM 45221T were calculated using the Orthologous Average Nucleotide Identity Tool (OAT) software available on the EzBioCloud web server (www.ezbiocloud.net/sw/oat) [19] and the web-based Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator version 3.0 (https://ggdc.dsmz.de/ggdc.php) [20], respectively.

The assembly of genome sequencing reads from strain J2-16T resulted in a complete single genome approximately 5384 kb in size (with an average genome coverage of 142.0×) without any plasmids. The 16S rRNA gene sequence identified in the genome of strain J2-16T was consistent with that obtained via PCR-based sequencing. Assessment using CheckM2 indicated genome completeness and contamination rates of 94.1 and 0.1 %, respectively, meeting the criteria (≥90 % completeness and ≤10 % contamination) for high-quality genomes [16]. The genome of strain J2-16T harboured a total of 4387 genes, comprising 4306 protein-coding genes, 25 pseudogenes, two rRNA operons containing two copies each of 16S, 5S, and 23S rRNA genes, and 46 tRNA genes. General genomic features of strain J2-16T are summarized and compared with closely related type strains of the genus Coraliomargarita in Table 1. The DNA G+C content of strain J2-16T, calculated from the whole genome, was 52.0 mol%, slightly lower than that of other Coraliomargarita species. These characteristics, including genome size, DNA G+C content, and gene contents, distinctly set strain J2-16T apart from other closely related Coraliomargarita species.

†‡The carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZy) genes were identified using the dbCAN3 meta server (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/blast.php) [22].

The phylogenetic analysis, based on the concatenated protein sequences of 120 ubiquitous single-copy marker genes (bac120 marker set), also indicated that strain J2-16T formed a phyletic lineage with members of the genus Coraliomargarita (Fig. 2), consistent with the findings from the 16S rRNA gene sequence-based analyses. The ANI and dDDH values between strain J2-16T and closely related type strains, C. akajimensis DSM 45221T and C. sinensis WN38T, were 71.2 and 20.0 %, and 70.4 and 19.9 %, respectively (Table S1), significantly below the thresholds for prokaryotic species delineation (ANI, ~95 %; dDDH, 70 %) [14]. These results suggest that strain J2-16T represents a distinct species within the genus Coraliomargarita. In conclusion, the genome relatedness and phylogenomic analyses of strain J2-16T with closely related Coraliomargarita type strains strongly support its classification as a novel species within the genus Coraliomargarita.

Algal symbiosis-associated genes

Bacteria inhabiting marine ecosystems are recognized for their ability to degrade algal polysaccharides and utilize algal cell wall constituents to support their growth [21]. Consequently, we identified carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) genes in strain J2-16T and closely related Coraliomargarita species using the dbCAN3 meta server (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/blast.php) [22]. Our analysis revealed that the genome of strain J2-16T was predicted to contain a total of 306 genes encoding various CAZy enzymes, representing a higher abundance compared to closely related strains, C. sinensis WN38T and C. akajimensis DSM 45221T, which possess 127 and 194 CAZy genes, respectively (Table 1). The CAZy genes of strain J2-16T were classified into five distinct classes: 214 glycoside hydrolase (GH), 43 glycosyltransferase (GT), 26 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), and 17 carbohydrate esterase (CE), with the absence of the auxiliary activities (AA) class. The higher abundance of these CAZy category genes compared to other reference Coraliomargarita strains (Table 1) indicates that strain J2-16T, isolated from the phycosphere of a marine green alga, likely possesses a more versatile capability to metabolize cell-wall components of algae compared to other Coraliomargarita species.

Morphology and physiology

Growth of strain J2-16T was evaluated at 30 °C for 3 days on various bacteriological agar media, including MA, Reasoner's 2A (R2A) agar (MBcell), Luria–Bertani (LB) agar (MBcell), tryptic soy agar (MBcell), and nutrient agar (MBcell), supplemented with NaCl to achieve final concentrations of approximately 2 % (w/v). Additionally, the growth of strain J2-16T was examined at different temperatures (ranging from 5 to 45 °C in 5 °C intervals) on MA for 3 days. Evaluation of growth at various pH values (ranging from pH 4.0 to 11.0 in 1.0 pH unit intervals) was conducted in MB at 30 °C for 3 days. MB media with desired pH levels were prepared using sodium citrate (pH 4.0–5.0), sodium phosphate (pH 6.0–8.0), and sodium carbonate–bicarbonate (pH 9.0–11.0) buffers [23], with pH adjustment after sterilization (121 °C for 15 min). Growth in different NaCl concentrations (ranging from 0 to 10 % in 1.0 % intervals) was assessed using MB medium prepared in the laboratory according to its composition. Anaerobic growth of strain J2-16T was evaluated by streaking it on MA and monitoring growth after 21 days of incubation at 30 °C under anaerobic conditions facilitated by the GasPak Plus system (BBL).

Cell morphology and the presence of flagella were examined using a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1010, jeol) and a phase-contrast microscope (Carl Zeiss Axio Scope.A1), respectively, with cells grown on MA at 30 °C for 3 days. Gram staining was performed using a Gram stain kit (bioMérieux) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Catalase and oxidase activities of strain J2-16T were determined by observing the production of oxygen bubbles in a 3 % (v/v) aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution and the oxidation of 1 % (w/v) tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (Merck), respectively [2425]. The following properties of strain J2-16T and two Coraliomargarita reference strains were concurrently assessed under the same conditions at 30 °C. Hydrolysis of Tween 20, Tween 80, casein, starch, aesculin, and tyrosine was evaluated on MA according to previously described methods [2425]. Further biochemical features were examined using the API 20NE kit from bioMérieux, following the manufacturer’s instructions, except that cells resuspended in ASW were used as an inoculum.

Strain J2-16T demonstrated robust growth on MA, with relatively favourable growth observed on R2A agar containing 2.0 % NaCl; however, it did not grow on nutrient agar, LB agar, or tryptic soy agar containing 2.0 % NaCl. Cells of strain J2-16T were Gram-stain-negative and non-motile cocci, measuring approximately 0.7–0.8 µm in diameter (Fig. S2). Anaerobic growth was observed after 21 days of incubation on MA at 30 °C, unlike other Coraliomargarita reference strains. Phenotypic properties of strain J2-16T, including flagellar motility, nitrate reduction, hydrolysis of tyrosine, gelatin, Tween 20, Tween 80, and casein, activity of arginine dihydrolase and urease, assimilation of d-glucose, l-arabinose, d-mannose, potassium gluconate, capric acid, trisodium citrate, and phenylacetic acid, and indole production, were common with other reference strains. However, other phenotypic properties, such as anaerobic growth, hydrolysis of starch and aesculin, activity of catalase, oxidase, and β-glucosidase, and assimilation of d-mannitol, maltose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, adipic acid, and malic acid, differentiated strain J2-16T from closely related type strains of the genus Coraliomargarita (Table 2).

Chemotaxonomic characteristics

Isoprenoid quinones of strain J2-16T were extracted from cells cultured in MB at 30 °C until reaching the exponential growth phase, following the procedure outlined by Minnikin et al. [26]. The quinones were analysed using an HPLC system (LC-20A; Shimadzu) equipped with a reversed-phase Kromasil column (250×4.6 mm; Akzo Nobel Center) and an SPD-M20A diode array detector (Shimadzu). Methanol–isopropanol (2 : 1, v/v) served as the eluent, and the flow rate was set at 1 ml min−1. Strain J2-16T and two Coraliomargarita type strains were cultivated in MB at 30 °C and harvested at the same growth phase (exponential growth phase, optical density, OD600=0.8) for cellular fatty acid analysis. Cellular fatty acids were saponified, methylated, and extracted according to the standard midi protocol. Fatty acid methyl esters were analysed using gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 6890) and identified using the RTSBA6 database of the Microbial Identification System (Sherlock version 6.0B) [27]. Polar lipids of strain J2-16T were extracted from cells harvested during their exponential growth phase and analysed by two-dimensional TLC, following the procedure described by Minnikin et al. [28]. Different reagents were used to detect various polar lipids: 10 % ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid reagent (for total polar lipids), ninhydrin (for aminolipids), Dittmer–Lester reagent (for phospholipids), and α-naphthol–sulphuric acid (for glycolipids). PG and PE identified from the polar lipid analysis were confirmed using standard polar lipid compounds purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

MK-7 was identified as the sole respiratory quinone in strain J2-16T, consistent with findings in all other members of the genus Coraliomargarita [14]. The major cellular fatty acids (>5 % of the total fatty acids) included C18 : 1 ω9c, iso-C14 : 0, C14 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0, C18 : 0 C16 : 0, and C17 : 1 ω8c. While the overall fatty acid profiles of strain J2-16T were similar to those of other reference Coraliomargarita species, there were some differences in the respective proportions of certain fatty acids, such as C16 : 0, C17 : 1 ω8c, anteiso-C17 : 0, and C16 : 0 3-OH (Table S2). Major polar lipids detected in strain J2-16T included PG, PE, two unidentified phospholipids, and three unidentified lipids (Fig. S3), with a profile resembling those of other closely related Coraliomargarita species [4].

Taxonomic conclusion

In conclusion, the phylogenetic, genomic relatedness, phenotypic, physiological, biochemical, and chemotaxonomic properties support the identification of strain J2-16T as representing a novel species of the genus Coraliomargarita, for which the name Coraliomargarita algicola sp. nov. is proposed.
