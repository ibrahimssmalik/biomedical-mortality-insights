==== Body
pmcMissing Citation

In the original publication [1], Ref. [31] was not cited. The citation has now been inserted in Related Works, Paragraph 1 and should read:

Figure 1. Diagram of the three types of collaboration strategies [31]. (a) Precoordinated vehicle feature fusion process. (b) Midphase feature fusion process of the cooperative vehicle. (c) Late feature fusion process of the cooperative vehicle.

In the original publication, Ref. [40] was not cited. The citation has now been inserted in HP3D-V2V Algorithm, Point Cloud Denoising, Paragraph 1 and should read:

Given the complexity of the environment in vehicle perception tasks, LiDAR point cloud data (PCD) usually has a large amount of nonvehicle noise, such as ground noise, wall point noise, and sensor noise [40].

The order of other references in the original manuscript has been adjusted accordingly. The newly added references appear below:

31. Li, Y.; Ren, S.; Wu, P.; Chen, S.; Feng, C.; Zhang, W. Learning distilled collaboration graph for multi-agent perception. Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst. 2021, 34, 29541–29552.

The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated.
