Following publication of the original article it was reported that due to a typesetting error there was an error in the city listed in Affiliation 3. The city was incorrectly given as Damietta but should be Cairo. Furthermore, the department was incorrectly given as ‘Internal Medicine Department’ instead of ‘Department of Internal Medicine’.

The correct affiliations are given in this Correction article and the original article has been updated.

The online version of the original article can be found at 10.1186/s12876-024-03262-3.
