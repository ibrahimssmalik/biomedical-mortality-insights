Next-level subcategories discuss typical tasks and applications of rotary UAVs and UAV complexes.

Topics that are not discussed within this section are presented in white rectangles with grey-colored text and borders.

2.1. Classifications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

An unmanned aerial vehicle is an aircraft designed to fly without a pilot on board, the flight control and steering of which being carried out by an appropriate program or with the help of a special control station located behind the aircraft [1,15].

An unmanned aircraft complex (unmanned aircraft system) includes an unmanned aircraft, remote piloting points (ground control stations), necessary control and control lines, and other elements specified in the approved design of the type of this complex [16]. This complex may include several unmanned aerial vehicles. In other words, a UAV is an aircraft controlled by one or more pilots using communication channels.

UAVs can be classified by [1,14,15,16,17,18]:Scope of tasks (purpose);

Power system (drive type);

Aircraft type (design);

Flight duration;

Control system type;

Mass;

Wing type;

Flight height;

Base type;

Type of fuel tank;

Radius of action;

Maximum flight speed;

The number of engines;

Take-off/landing type;

The time of receiving the collected information.

Selected classifications are provided below.

According to the purpose, the following are distinguished [1,16]:Commercial UAVs used for profit, in particular, in agriculture, video recording, geological research, etc.;

Military UAVs designed for military operations, reconnaissance, support, communication tasks, etc.;

Civilian UAVs used for civilian purposes, such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, scientific research, etc.

UAVs can also be classified by drive type [15,16]:Electric UAVs—need an electric power source for flight;

Hybrid UAVs—use both electric and fuel as the power system;

Fuel UAVs—driven by an internal combustion engine.

This classification is used to determine the types and characteristics of UAVs depending on the fields of their use and functional capabilities.

According to the design, UAVs are divided into five main categories [1,15,16,17].

(1) Aircraft (fixed-wing), including the following:Monoplanes—one-wing construction;

Biplanes—use two wings—upper and lower;

Triplanes—use three wings located one above the other;

Wings—delta-shaped construction.

(2) Multirotor UAVs, which include the following:Quadcopters, four rotors;

Hexacopters, six rotors;

Gyrocopters (octocopters), eight rotors.

(3) Tailsitters—a combination of fixed wings and multirotors that uses the advantages of both designs.

(4) VTOL (vertical take-off and landing)—includes UAVs that can perform vertical take-off and landing and then operate in horizontal flight mode.

(5) Balloons and airships—ultralight vehicles that operate using forces of air and can have a gas cylinder for lifting.

According to the range and duration of the flight, UAVs are characterized as follows [15,17]:Short-endurance—with a flight range and duration of up to an hour;

Medium-endurance—from one to several hours;

Long-endurance UAVs—the range and flight duration of which are more than several hours (up to several dozen hours).

The classification of the International Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems, UVSI, distinguishes UAVs according to the following [19,20,21]:Flight mass;

Flight duration;

Flight endurance;

Flight altitude;

Areas of use.

This classification is summarized in Table 1.

Each of these structures has its own advantages and limitations but, in this research, we are focused mostly on multirotor UAVs as one of the most popular and easy-to-use vehicles for personal and civilian purposes.

2.2. Multicopters

This paper is focused on the most popular UAVs for civil use, namely, multicopters or multirotors. These include UAVs with more than two propellers. Reactive moments are balanced due to the rotation of the support propellers in pairs in different directions or the inclination of the thrust vector of each propeller in a certain direction. Unmanned multicopters are usually mini and micro UAVs. The most common design of multicopters is a quadcopter. The presence of four rigidly fixed rotors makes it quite easy to lift this UAV into the air. In total, nine symmetrical designs of multicopters are known [22,23], which differ in the location of the frame and the number of support propellers [24,25] (Figure 2). The frame consists of a platform for power and control units and shoulders formed by beams.

Conventional designation of the scheme is formed using an alphabet character indicating the frame shape and a numerical character indicating the number of motors. The upright frame shape is designated by the characters “I” and “+” (plus) and the cross-shaped frame is designated by the characters “V”, “X”, and “Y”. For example, the IY6 is an upright frame hexacopter with three beams. If one of the beams coincides with the longitudinal axis of the multicopter, then the frame shape is considered to be upright. If the longitudinal axis divides the angle between two adjacent beams in half, then the frame shape is considered to be cross-shaped. The number of support propellers depends on the total thrust required for flight. To compensate for the reactive torque, they are placed opposite each other or in a coaxial scheme. The Y4 quadcopter provides a more stable operation compared to the tricopter. The motor efficiency increases by one-third. The X4 [26] and I4 [27] quadcopters are equipped with four support propellers located at the ends of the frame beams. This is the simplest design of a four-propeller multirotor. There is no separate yaw control mechanism, which makes the flight less stable. At the same time, with such a design, the motors work most efficiently. Another advantage of the X4 and I4 quadcopter is the ability to programmatically select the frame shape. The design of the VTail quadcopter is similar to both a tricopter and a Y4 quadcopter: typically, two propellers are located at the ends of the beams in front [28]. The other two, which are used to control the yaw, are next to each other in the tail section at a certain angle to the frame. Compared to an X4 or I4 quadcopter, VTail motors require more power, but the yaw control is more predictable. The design of Y6 and IY6 hexacopters is similar to the design of tricopters [29]. However, instead of a servo for yaw control, a coaxial arrangement of support propellers is used. The advantage of such multicopters over I6 and X6 hexacopters is its compactness on the one hand. On the other hand, the coaxial arrangement of the support propellers leads to a decrease in the motor’s efficiency [30]. The design of the Y6 and IY6 hexacopters also allows for software selection of the frame orientation.

A pentacopter is an asymmetric multicopter scheme [31]. The frame of such an aircraft has five beams: the front two at an angle of 120° between them and the other three at an angle of 60° between them. This design is similar to the I6 hexacopter without the front beam. The obvious advantage of the pentacopter is a large angle between the front beams, which eliminates the problem of parts of the multicopter structure falling into the frame on one shoulder. The V8 octocopter performs controlled flight when four motors on two adjacent arms fail [32]. Due to this, the safety and stability of the flight is better than those of hexa-, quad-, and tricopters. However, I8 and V8 octocopters require significant energy consumption. The X8 octocopter has eight propellers arranged in a coaxial pattern [33]. The design of such a multirotor is similar to the design of a quadcopter. The X8 octocopter has better controllability thanks to the ability to perform yaw control. However, due to the coaxial design, the motors are used less efficiently than in I8 and V8 octocopters.

Also, it should be mentioned that the main features of a copter design could be found in a fixed-wing UAV with a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) system [34,35]. These UAVs have four or more propellers for take-off and landing and fixed wings for long-range flight.

Peculiarities of the most widely used copter designs are discussed in Section 3.

2.3. UAV Complex

The UAV complex contains three key components that work together to effectively perform tasks [36,37,38]:

1. The UAV itself. It is an aircraft or drone that carries out missions in the air. It is equipped with various sensors, cameras, and other devices for collecting information.

2. The ground station or ground base, which is the place where the drone is launched and lands, as well as where the equipment for communication and control over it is installed. A ground station can be mobile (such as a vehicle or ship) or stationary (such as a land base). The ground station contains additional equipment necessary for the operation of the UAV, the antenna system, and the catapult.

3. The operator, who is a person or a team of people who are responsible for operating and controlling the UAV during the flight [39,40,41,42]. The operator interacts with the drone through a ground station using a remote control or a computer used to send commands and receive information from the drone’s sensors and cameras.

Among the main functions of the operator, there are the following:Mission planning;

Setting flight parameters;

Data monitoring from sensors and cameras;

Decision making in accordance with the received data.

The UAV operator is responsible for planning missions, including determining flight paths, waypoints, and operational parameters [43]. Mission planning involves considering factors such as weather conditions, airspace regulations, and mission objectives.

Also, the operator controls the UAV’s navigation and flight parameters, including steering, altitude control, and speed adjustments [40,43]. Depending on the mission requirements, the operator may manually pilot the UAV or utilize autonomous flight modes for waypoint navigation and autonomous operations.

In the event of emergencies or unexpected situations, the operator takes appropriate actions to mitigate risks and ensure the safety of the UAV and surrounding environment [40,43]. This may involve initiating emergency procedures, executing a safe landing, or implementing contingency plans as needed.

3. Types of Multirotor Drones

This section discusses peculiarities and main applications of the most widely spread multirotor drone types, namely, quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, and VTOL drones. The section structure is outlined in Figure 3.

3.1. Quadcopters

A quadcopter, also known as a quadrotor, is a type of copter drone that features four rotors. Each rotor is mounted at the end of a horizontal arm, and the propellers generate lift by spinning in opposite directions. Quadcopters are widely popular due to their simple design, stability, and ease of control. The main features of quadcopters and their applications are listed below [44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52].

Their capabilities contribute to improved situational awareness, enhanced response times, and the overall effectiveness of security operations.

4.3. Agriculture

Drones have emerged as powerful tools in precision agriculture, revolutionizing the way that farmers monitor, manage, and optimize their crops. The integration of drone technology in agriculture provides farmers with valuable data for more informed decision making, resource optimization, and increased crop yields. What follows is an exploration of the applications of drones in precision agriculture [99,100,101,102,103,104].

This information assists farmers in optimizing irrigation schedules and identifying areas with overwatering or insufficient moisture. Improved irrigation management leads to water conservation and increased crop productivity.

Crop Scouting and Surveillance. Drones provide a quick and efficient means of crop scouting [102]. Farmers can regularly survey large areas, identifying potential issues and making timely decisions. Surveillance capabilities also aid in monitoring the growth stages of crops, allowing for precise management practices.

Livestock Monitoring. Drones are used to monitor and manage livestock, providing insights into herd movements, health, and behavior [110]. These data aid in optimizing grazing patterns, assessing the condition of animals, and improving overall livestock management.

Yield Prediction. Drones equipped with multispectral sensors capture data related to plant health and biomass [111]. By analyzing these data, farmers can make accurate predictions about crop yields. Yield prediction supports better planning for the harvesting, storage, and marketing of agricultural produce.

Disease and Pest Control. Drones equipped with sensors and cameras can detect signs of diseases and pest infestations early on [112,113]. This enables farmers to implement targeted and timely interventions, reducing the need for broad-spectrum chemical applications and minimizing the impact on beneficial organisms.

In summary, drones play a crucial role in precision agriculture by providing farmers with accurate and timely information to enhance decision-making processes. From crop monitoring to variable rate application, drones contribute to increased efficiency, resource optimization, and sustainable agricultural practices.

4.4. Search and Rescue

Drones have become invaluable tools in search and rescue (SAR) operations, providing rapid and efficient assistance in locating missing persons, assessing disaster-stricken areas, and improving overall response capabilities. Below, a discussion on how drones are employed in search and rescue operations is presented [116,117,118,119].

Rapid Deployment. Drones offer quick and easy deployment, enabling search and rescue teams to cover large areas in a short amount of time [90,91,94]. Their ability to launch rapidly provides a crucial advantage in the early stages of a search operation.

Aerial Surveillance. Equipped with high-resolution cameras and thermal imaging sensors, drones provide a bird’s-eye view of the search area [120,121]. Aerial surveillance enhances the visibility of the terrain, making it easier to spot individuals or objects, especially in challenging or remote locations.

Night Vision Capabilities. Drones equipped with infrared or thermal cameras offer night vision capabilities [122,123]. This is particularly useful in search and rescue missions conducted during low-light conditions, allowing teams to locate individuals or detect heat signatures in darkness.

Terrain Mapping. Drones can create detailed maps of the search area, including topography and vegetation [124,125]. This information assists search and rescue teams in planning their approach, identifying potential obstacles, and optimizing routes to reach target locations more efficiently.

Communication Support. Drones equipped with communication equipment can serve as mobile communication hubs, helping to establish or strengthen communication links in areas with limited or disrupted communication infrastructure [126]. This is crucial for coordinating rescue efforts and relaying information to command centers.

Swift Survey of Disaster Zones. In the aftermath of natural disasters or emergencies, drones can swiftly survey disaster zones, assessing the extent of damage and identifying areas where rescue efforts are needed most urgently [127,128,129]. This information guides rescue teams in prioritizing their response.

Monitoring Hazardous Environments. Drones are capable of entering hazardous environments, such as collapsed buildings, unstable terrains, or areas with potential chemical hazards, without risking human lives [130,131]. They provide real-time visual information to assess the situation and plan safe and effective rescue operations.

Search Efficiency. Drones equipped with intelligent software and algorithms can autonomously search designated areas based on predefined patterns [132,133]. This automation enhances search efficiency, covering more ground in less time and improving the chances of locating missing persons or survivors.

Payload Delivery. Drones can be equipped with payload delivery systems to drop essential supplies, medical kits, or communication devices to individuals in distress [132,134]. This capability is particularly beneficial in situations where direct access by rescue teams is challenging.

Collaborative Swarms. Collaborative drone swarms, including both aerial and terrestrial unmanned vehicles, can be deployed to search large areas simultaneously [135,136,137,138,139]. These coordinated efforts increase the likelihood of finding missing persons or detecting signs of life in expansive search zones.

Post-Event Documentation. Drones assist in documenting the post-event scenario, capturing images and videos that aid in post-mission analysis, debriefing, and improving future search and rescue strategies [140,141].

In summary, drones play a vital role in search and rescue operations by providing a versatile, efficient, and technologically advanced means of surveying, locating, and assisting individuals in distress. Their capabilities contribute to faster response times, enhanced situational awareness, and improved overall effectiveness in search and rescue missions.

5. Drone Control Methods and Systems

This section starts with an overview of typical electronic components used in drones, which is followed by a discussion on the most popular methods used to control drones, starting with the simplest traditional methods and closing with more advanced and sophisticated methods used to control drone swarms. Reviewed control methods are presented in Figure 7.

5.1. Typical Set of UAV Electronic Components

The electronic component of the UAV includes at least the following [142,143,144,145]:Flight controller;

Accumulator;

Brushless motor and ESC;

Radio transmitters;

Location and navigation sensors: GPS, air speed, and others;

Video system (analog or digital): transmitter, receiver, camera, antenna.

The main part of the drone control system is a flight controller—an electronic device that controls the flight of an aircraft. The term is used for unmanned aerial vehicles, including aircraft models and drones. Usually, the flight controller receives commands from the radio control system, but it can work completely autonomously according to a predetermined flight plan or in the object tracing mode. Moreover, the autonomous flight mode is found both in personal “selfie-copters” and in advanced military devices.

The functions of the flight controller include the following [142,143]:Stabilization of the device in the air using sensors such as a gyroscope, accelerometer, compass (they are usually located on the flight controller board);

Altitude maintenance using a barometric altimeter (the barometer is usually built into the flight controller) or using a GPS sensor;

Heading speed measurement using a differential flight speed sensor (Pitot tube) or using a GPS sensor;

Automatic flight to predetermined points (mission planner);

Transmission of current flight parameters to the control panel;

Ensuring flight safety (return to the take-off point in case of signal loss, automatic landing, automatic take-off);

Stopping in front of an obstacle (for multicopters) or flying around obstacles (for airplanes) if sensors are available;

Connection of additional peripherals: OSD (on-screen display), servo drives, LED indication, relay, and others.

The connection of third-party devices, such as a GPS, video transmitter, camera, differential speed sensor, etc., occurs through their ports, which are marked on the flight controller board and typically include the following [142,143]:UART (RX/TX)—universal asynchronous receiver–transmitter;

USART (RX/TX)—universal synchronous–asynchronous receiver–transmitter;

I2C (DA/CL or SDA/SCL)—inter-integrated circuit;

SBUS—SPARC bus;

CANBUS (RX/TX)—controller area network bus;

VTX—video transmitter.

Flight controllers may implement different control principles, and the most popular, such as PID controllers, model predictive controllers, and neural-network-based controllers, are described in more detail in the following sub-sections.

5.2. PID Controllers

Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers are widely used in the field of drone flight control systems to achieve stable and responsive performance. These controllers utilize three components—proportional (P), integral (I), and derivative (D)—to adjust the drone’s behavior and maintain a desired state [146,147].

The proportional component is responsible for correcting the current error in the system. Error, in the context of a PID controller, is the difference between the desired state (setpoint) and the actual state (output). The proportional term contributes to the correction by applying a force proportional to the current error. In drone flight control, the proportional term adjusts the drone’s response based on how far it is from its intended position. For example, if the drone is deviating from its desired altitude, the proportional term applies a force to bring it back to the setpoint [146,147,148,149,150].

The integral component addresses accumulated error over time. It adds up the errors that have occurred over time and adjusts the control signal to eliminate any persistent deviation from the setpoint. In drone flight control, the integral term helps to correct for steady-state errors that might arise due to external disturbances, wind, or imperfections in the drone’s dynamics. It contributes to ensuring that the drone reaches and maintains the desired state over the long term.

The derivative component anticipates future errors by considering the rate of change in the error. It dampens the system’s response by applying a force proportional to the rate at which the error is changing. In drone flight control, the derivative term helps to prevent overshooting and oscillations. If the drone is approaching the setpoint too quickly, the derivative term acts to slow down the rate of change, providing smoother and more controlled movements.

The PID controller combines the proportional, integral, and derivative components to calculate the control signal that adjusts the drone’s actuators (motors, propellers, etc.). The combined action aims to provide a balance between a fast response, minimal steady-state error, and reduced overshooting or oscillations. The general PID controller operation principle is shown in Figure 8.

The performance of a PID controller is highly dependent on tuning its parameters—proportional gain (Kp), integral gain (Ki), and derivative gain (Kd). Proper tuning is essential for achieving optimal stability, responsiveness, and robustness in the control system.

In conclusion, PID controllers in drone flight use the principles of proportional, integral, and derivative components to achieve stable and precise control. By adjusting these components and their associated gains, the controller can be tuned to meet the specific requirements of different drone models and environmental conditions, ensuring effective and reliable flight control.

5.3. Model Predictive Control (MPC)

Model predictive control (MPC) is an advanced control strategy that has gained popularity in drone flight control systems for its ability to handle complex dynamics, constraints, and uncertainties. MPC differs from traditional control methods by considering predictions of the system’s future behavior over a finite time horizon, optimizing control inputs to achieve specific objectives [151,152,153,154,155,156]. What follows is an exploration of the use of MPC for more advanced drone flight control strategies.

MPC requires an accurate dynamic model of the drone system, including its kinematics and dynamics. This model incorporates information about the drone’s structure, propulsion system, sensors, and environmental factors. Dynamic modeling is crucial for predicting the drone’s future states and responses.

This control type considers a prediction horizon, which defines the time span over which the system’s future states are predicted. Additionally, it employs a control horizon, which determines the time span over which control inputs are optimized [152]. Adjusting these horizons allows for a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

MPC is well suited for handling constraints in the system, such as physical limitations of the drone, safety constraints, and environmental restrictions [152,153,154]. The controller optimizes the control inputs while ensuring that the predicted future states satisfy these constraints, leading to safe and efficient operations.

Model predictive control is adaptable to changes in the operating conditions, disturbances, and uncertainties. It continuously updates predictions based on real-time sensor feedback, enabling the controller to respond to dynamic environmental conditions or unexpected events during flight [154,155].

This method can be used for trajectory tracking and path planning [155,156]. By optimizing the control inputs over a predictive horizon, MPC allows the drone to follow complex trajectories and paths accurately. This is particularly useful in applications like inspection, surveillance, and mapping, where precise movement is required.

MPC calculates the optimal control inputs by solving an optimization problem iteratively over the prediction horizon [151,155]. This allows the controller to adaptively adjust the control inputs based on the evolving system states, ensuring optimal performance. The simplified MPC principle is shown in Figure 9.

Also, MPC can be employed for obstacle avoidance by integrating obstacle information into the predictive model. The controller adjusts the drone’s trajectory to navigate around obstacles while respecting constraints and optimizing the overall flight path.

The use of MPC can contribute to energy-efficient drone flight. By considering the energy consumption model in the optimization process, the controller can minimize energy usage while meeting the mission objectives.

MPC allows for the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives, such as reaching a destination quickly while minimizing energy consumption. This flexibility makes it suitable for applications where various criteria need to be considered simultaneously.

Finally, MPC provides a platform for researchers and engineers to experiment with and develop advanced control strategies. Its flexibility and adaptability make it a valuable tool for exploring innovative drone control approaches and addressing new challenges in the field.

Thus, MPC offers a powerful and flexible framework for implementing advanced drone flight control strategies. By considering predictive models, handling constraints, and optimizing control inputs over time, MPC enhances the capabilities of drones in terms of precision, adaptability, and efficiency in various applications.

5.4. Neural-Network-Based Control

Neural-network-based flight control has gained attention in recent years as a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of copter drones. Neural networks, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), offer the ability to learn complex relationships and patterns from data, allowing for adaptive and dynamic control strategies [157,158,159,160,161,162]. What follows is a discussion on the application of neural networks in enhancing flight control for copter drones.

Adaptive Control. Neural networks are capable of learning from data and adapting their behavior to varying flight conditions [163,164]. This adaptability is particularly valuable in dynamic environments where traditional control methods may struggle to provide optimal performance.

This autonomy is valuable in applications such as search and rescue, surveillance, and exploration, where drones need to operate in challenging and dynamic environments.

Fault Tolerance. Neural-network-based flight control systems can exhibit a degree of fault tolerance [159]. By learning from diverse scenarios during training, the network may be more resilient to unexpected disturbances, sensor failures, or other issues that could arise during flight.

Trajectory Optimization. Neural networks can optimize trajectories for copter drones by learning patterns from historical flight data [169]. This is useful in applications like aerial photography or surveillance, where specific trajectories need to be followed for optimal data collection.

Real-time Adaptation. Neural networks can adapt in real time to changes in the environment or system dynamics [170]. This real-time adaptation is crucial for drones operating in unpredictable conditions, enabling them to maintain stability and responsiveness.

Improved Maneuverability. Neural-network-based controllers can enhance the maneuverability of copter drones, allowing for more agile and precise movements [171]. This is beneficial in applications such as drone racing or dynamic inspections where responsiveness is critical.

Avoidance of Obstacles. Neural networks can be trained to recognize and avoid obstacles during flight [172]. This obstacle avoidance capability enhances the safety of copter drones, especially in environments with complex structures or moving objects.

In summary, the application of neural networks in copter flight control holds great potential for enhancing adaptability, autonomy, and overall performance. From learning control policies to optimizing trajectories and improving fault tolerance, neural-network-based approaches contribute to advancing the capabilities of copter drones across a variety of applications.

5.5. Collaborative Swarm Control Strategies

These control types involve coordinating the actions of multiple drones to achieve collective goals efficiently and effectively. These strategies leverage principles from swarm intelligence, distributed control, and cooperation among agents. Novel algorithms, such as those described in [173,174], could be applied for this task. Typical collaborative swarm control strategies for drone systems include the following:Decentralized control, assuming distributed decision-making authority among individual drones, allowing them to make local decisions based on local information while coordinating with neighboring drones [175]. Each drone operates autonomously, reacting to its environment and communicating with nearby drones to achieve collective objectives without central coordination;

Flocking and formation control, aiming to maintain desired spatial arrangements among drones, such as maintaining a formation shape or flying in a coordinated flock [176]. Drones adjust their positions and velocities based on local interactions with neighboring drones, following simple rules inspired by natural flocking behaviors observed in birds and insects;

Swarm intelligence algorithms, such as ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony optimization, can be adapted for drone swarm control [177]. These algorithms enable drones to collectively explore, search, or optimize objectives in a distributed manner by sharing information and iteratively updating their behaviors;

Task allocation and division of labor, which assign specific tasks or roles to individual drones based on their capabilities, resources, and proximity to the task [178]. Drones collaborate to divide complex tasks into smaller subtasks and allocate them among the swarm members, optimizing resource utilization and task efficiency;

Leader–follower hierarchies, which establish hierarchical relationships among drones, with designated leaders guiding the behavior of follower drones [179]. Leaders may provide high-level commands or waypoints for followers to follow, while followers adjust their positions and velocities to maintain the formation relative to the leader;

Collaborative learning and adaptation mechanisms, which enable drone swarms to learn from collective experiences, share knowledge, and adapt their behaviors over time [180]. Drones may employ machine learning algorithms, reinforcement learning, or evolutionary algorithms to improve performance, optimize strategies, and adapt to evolving mission scenarios.

By employing these collaborative swarm control strategies, drone systems can achieve enhanced coordination, efficiency, scalability, and robustness in various applications, including surveillance, search and rescue, environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspection, and delivery services.

6. Sensors and Perception

This section briefly discusses a typical set of sensors used in drones to ensure their operability, stability, and reliability during the flight.

6.1. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)

An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a crucial component in a drone’s sensor suite, providing essential information about the drone’s orientation and acceleration. Comprising a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes, an IMU works together to measure and report the drone’s motion in three-dimensional space. It includes the following components and features [181,182,183,184,185,186,187].

Accelerometers. Accelerometers within the IMU measure linear acceleration along the three axes (X, Y, and Z) in the drone’s body frame [185,187]. They detect changes in velocity and provide information about the drone’s linear motion. The accelerometers respond to both the drone’s acceleration due to external forces (such as wind or thrust changes) and the gravitational acceleration.

Gyroscopes. Gyroscopes in the IMU measure the drone’s angular rate of rotation around each axis [185,187]. They provide information about the drone’s rate of change in orientation, allowing for the calculation of the drone’s angular velocity. Gyroscopes are crucial for determining the drone’s rotational movements and changes in heading.

Integration for Orientation. By integrating the data from accelerometers over time, the IMU can determine the drone’s velocity [181,182,183]. Further integration of velocity provides information about the drone’s displacement or position. However, due to integration errors accumulating over time, the IMU alone is not sufficient for precise position estimation. Additional sensor data, such as those from a GPS or visual odometry, are often used to mitigate these errors.

Quaternion Representation. IMUs commonly provide orientation information in the form of quaternions [188]. Quaternions are a mathematical representation of orientation that avoids the issues associated with traditional Euler angles (yaw, pitch, and roll), such as gimbal lock. The quaternion representation ensures the accurate and continuous tracking of the drone’s orientation.

Attitude Stabilization. The IMU’s data on angular rates and accelerations are crucial for the drone’s flight controller to stabilize and control its attitude (orientation) [189]. By measuring deviations from the desired orientation, the flight controller adjusts the drone’s motor speeds to maintain stable flight.

Filtering Techniques. IMU data are susceptible to noise and drift over time [190]. Filtering techniques, such as the complementary filter or the Kalman filter, are commonly employed to improve the accuracy and reliability of the orientation estimates by combining IMU data with other sensor inputs.

Inertial measurement units are integral components of inertial navigation systems (INSs). In combination with other sensors like GPS, magnetometers, and barometers, IMUs contribute to precise navigation by continuously updating the drone’s position, velocity, and orientation.

Control Feedback Loop. IMU data are used in a closed-loop feedback system, providing real-time information to the flight controller [186]. The flight controller processes these data to make rapid adjustments to the drone’s motor outputs, ensuring stable flight and responsive control.

Low-Level Stabilization. IMUs are responsible for low-level stabilization tasks, including maintaining the drone’s level orientation, compensating for external disturbances, and enabling smooth transitions between different flight modes [191].

Calibration and Alignment. Proper calibration and alignment of the IMU are crucial for ensuring accurate sensor measurements [192]. Calibration procedures account for sensor biases, offsets, and misalignments, improving the overall reliability of the IMU data.

In summary, the inertial measurement unit plays a central role in providing critical information about a drone’s orientation and acceleration. These data are fundamental for flight control, stabilization, navigation, and overall performance in various operational scenarios. The integration of IMU data with other sensor inputs enhances the drone’s ability to navigate and operate effectively in diverse environments.

6.2. Global Positioning System and Global Navigation Satellite System (GPS and GNSS)

The Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are satellite-based navigation systems that play a crucial role in drone navigation, providing accurate position, velocity, and timing information [193,194]. The main GNSSs used in multirotor drones are the following [195]:GPS (Global Positioning System), which is the most common and best known GNSS. It consists of a satellite constellation that provides signals to determine the exact geographical position;

GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System), which is the Russian alternative to the American GPS. It consists of a constellation of Russian satellites that provide navigation signals;

Galileo, which is the European Union’s navigation system. It provides independent signals for navigation and positioning;

BeiDou, which is the Chinese navigation system. It provides signals for navigation in China and neighboring regions;

NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), which is the Indian navigation system developed by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).

Most modern multicopters are equipped with GNSS receivers that can work with different systems at the same time (e.g., GPS and GLONASS) to provide more accurate navigation. The GNSS is important for many aspects of multicopter flight, including stabilization, homing, pinpointing, and other functions.

The GPS and GNSS are used for drone navigation, such as for the following purposes [195].

Position Determination. The primary function of the GPS/GNSS for drones is to determine their precise location in three-dimensional space. By receiving signals from multiple satellites, the drone’s GPS/GNSS receiver calculates its position using trilateration, allowing for accurate latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates.

Velocity Estimation. The GPS/GNSS enables drones to determine their speed and direction by analyzing changes in position over time. This velocity information is crucial for planning and executing flight maneuvers, adjusting the drone’s trajectory, and ensuring precise navigation.

Navigation and Waypoint Following. The GPS/GNSS is integral to drone navigation, especially in waypoint-based flight modes. Operators can define waypoints on a map, and the drone autonomously follows these waypoints using GPS coordinates. This feature is valuable for various applications, including aerial surveying, mapping, and surveillance.

Autonomous Flight. Drones leverage the GPS/GNSS for autonomous flight operations, enabling them to operate without continuous human intervention [196]. Autonomously controlled drones use GPS data to navigate, follow predetermined routes, and execute specific tasks, such as surveying large areas or inspecting infrastructure.

Return-to-Home (RTH) Functionality. The GPS/GNSS plays a critical role in the return-to-home feature, which allows drones to return to their take-off point automatically [197]. This feature is activated in scenarios such as low battery levels or loss of communication with the remote controller, ensuring that the drone returns safely.

Geofencing. The GPS/GNSS enables the implementation of geofencing, defining virtual boundaries within which the drone is allowed to operate [198]. This is crucial for compliance with regulations and preventing the drone from entering restricted or unsafe areas.

Precision Agriculture. In agriculture, drones equipped with a GPS/GNSS are used for precision farming [199]. Drones can follow precise routes for crop monitoring, imaging, and application of fertilizers or pesticides, optimizing resource usage and improving crop yields.

Mapping and Surveying. The GPS/GNSS enhances the accuracy of mapping and surveying tasks performed by drones [200]. The precise positioning information allows for the creation of detailed and georeferenced maps, topographic surveys, and 3D models.

Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS. The RTK GPS is an advanced GPS/GNSS technique that uses correction data from a ground station to achieve centimeter-level accuracy [201]. Drones equipped with an RTK GPS are employed in applications requiring extremely high precision, such as land surveying and construction site monitoring.

Emergency Response and Search and Rescue. The GPS/GNSS is crucial for drones involved in emergency response and search and rescue operations [132]. Accurate positioning information aids in locating individuals or incidents, optimizing the deployment of resources, and improving overall operational efficiency.

Timing Synchronization. The GPS/GNSS provides accurate timing synchronization for drones [202]. This is essential for coordinating the actions of multiple drones in a swarm, facilitating collaborative tasks and ensuring precise timing in various applications.

Integration with Other Sensors. GPS/GNSS data are often integrated with information from other sensors, such as IMUs, barometers, and magnetometers, to enhance overall navigation accuracy, especially in scenarios where GPS signals may be temporarily obstructed or degraded [203].

So, the GPS and GNSS are fundamental to drone navigation, enabling accurate positioning, velocity estimation, and autonomous flight capabilities. Drones leverage these satellite-based systems across various industries, enhancing their operational capabilities and contributing to the development of innovative applications.

6.3. Computer Vision

The integration of computer vision for object detection and recognition in drone-based applications has become increasingly prevalent, opening up new possibilities and enhancing the capabilities of UAVs. Computer vision allows drones to autonomously process visual information, identify objects, and make informed decisions based on their surroundings [204,205,206,207,208,209]. This provides the following possibilities and features.

Object Detection. Computer vision enables drones to identify and locate objects within their field of view [204,206,207,208,209]. Object detection algorithms, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) [210] or SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) [211], are commonly employed to detect and draw bounding boxes around objects in real time. This is useful in applications such as surveillance, search and rescue, and monitoring large areas.

Object Tracking. Object tracking algorithms in computer vision allow drones to follow and monitor the movement of identified objects over time [212]. This is beneficial for tracking moving targets, such as vehicles, individuals, or wildlife, and is applicable in scenarios like aerial cinematography, security surveillance, and wildlife monitoring.

Automated Inspection. Drones equipped with computer vision systems can autonomously inspect and identify structural defects, damages, or anomalies in infrastructure. This is valuable for applications in industries such as construction, energy, and telecommunications, where routine inspections are essential.

Precision Agriculture. In agriculture, computer vision on drones can identify and analyze crops, monitor plant health, and detect issues such as diseases or nutrient deficiencies [203,205,206,207,208,209]. This information aids farmers in making data-driven decisions for precision agriculture, optimizing crop management, and improving yields.

Environmental Monitoring. Drones with computer vision capabilities contribute to environmental monitoring by detecting and analyzing changes in ecosystems, wildlife habitats, and natural resources [213]. This is crucial for applications like biodiversity assessment, deforestation monitoring, and climate research.

Mapping and 3D Reconstruction. Computer vision facilitates the creation of high-resolution maps and 3D reconstructions by processing visual data captured by drones [214]. This is valuable in urban planning, construction site monitoring, and archaeological surveys, providing detailed and accurate representations of the terrain.

Object Recognition and Classification. Beyond detection, computer vision enables drones to recognize and classify objects based on their visual characteristics [215]. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are employed for tasks like identifying specific objects, animals, or structures. This is applicable in diverse fields, including wildlife conservation, public safety, and infrastructure inspection.

Augmented Reality (AR) Applications. Computer vision contributes to augmented reality experiences in drone applications [216]. By recognizing and overlaying digital information on real-world objects, drones can provide enhanced situational awareness or deliver interactive experiences for users in fields like tourism, education, or entertainment.

Event Security and Crowd Monitoring. Drones equipped with computer vision systems contribute to event security by monitoring crowds, detecting anomalies, and identifying potential security threats [95,96]. This enhances situational awareness during large gatherings, concerts, or public events.

Search and Rescue Operations. Computer vision aids in search and rescue missions by helping drones to identify and locate missing persons or objects in challenging environments [118,119,120,121]. It enhances the efficiency of search operations, especially in scenarios with dense vegetation, rough terrain, or low visibility.

Collision Avoidance. Computer vision systems contribute to collision avoidance by enabling drones to detect and react to obstacles in their flight path [217]. This is crucial for safe and autonomous navigation, preventing collisions with buildings, trees, or other drones.

Thus, the integration of computer vision for object detection and recognition significantly expands the capabilities of drones across various applications. By processing visual information in real time, drones equipped with computer vision systems can autonomously interpret their environment, make informed decisions, and execute tasks with a high degree of precision and efficiency.

6.4. Environmental Information (SLAM)

SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is a technology that allows an unmanned aerial vehicle to simultaneously determine its position in space and create a map of the environment [218,219,220,221,222,223].

The main components of SLAM for drones include the following:

Cameras used to obtain visual data environment;

Laser rangefinders (LiDARs), which can be used to measure distances and create accurate three-dimensional maps of the environment;

Depth cameras that measure distances to objects and allow one to estimate the depth of objects in the image;

Inertial sensors providing information on the acceleration and rotation of the drone;

Data processing systems and SLAM algorithms that analyze input data and use them to determine the position and create a map.

SLAM is used to provide the following:Autonomous flight. SLAM allows the drone to navigate in an unknown environment, simultaneously creating a map and determining its position;

Avoiding obstacles. This technology helps in avoiding collisions with obstacles, as the drone can detect objects and avoid them;

Stabilization and accurate position maintenance. SLAM helps to keep the drone stable in the air even when there is no access to the GNSS signal;

Environmental mapping. The system creates accurate three-dimensional maps of the environment that can be used for further analysis or navigation;

Recognition and tracking of objects. The technology allows the drone to recognize and track the movement of objects around it.

SLAM is a very useful technology for drones, especially in environments where it is difficult or impossible to use a GNSS (for example, indoors or in areas with complex magnetic fields).

6.5. Short-Range Radio Navigation Systems (VOR, DME)

Short-range radio navigation systems (VOR—VHF omnidirectional range, DME—distance-measuring equipment) are used in aviation to navigate and determine distances between aircraft and ground points [224,225].

However, for multirotor drones, these systems are generally not standard equipment. Instead, drones usually specialize in using global navigation satellite systems such as a GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, etc.

The main reasons for why multirotor drones do not use VOR and DME are as follows:The equipment size and weight of VOR and DME require large and heavy antennas and equipment that is difficult and inconvenient to install on a drone;

Frequency bands. VOR and DME operate in the high-frequency radio range, requiring large antennas and powerful transmitters;

Licensing and regulation. The use of VOR and DME requires special permits and licenses from regulatory authorities;

Intentional range limitations. VOR and DME are for aviation use and have a limited range that varies from airport to airport;

Low compatibility with drones. The use of VOR and DME in multirotor drones may cause electromagnetic interference and affect the normal operation of other electronic components.

So, while VOR and DME are useful in aviation, they are not standard components for multirotor drones.

6.6. Object Detection and Tracking

Object detection and tracking are important functions for multirotor drones, as they allow one to automatically detect and track the movement of objects in the environment. For these tasks, various technologies and algorithms are used [226,227,228,229,230,231,232].

The main components of object recognition and tracking systems in multirotor drones include the following:Cameras and visual systems. Cameras, especially those with high resolution and high frame rates, are the primary source of visual input. They allow the drone to see its surroundings;
