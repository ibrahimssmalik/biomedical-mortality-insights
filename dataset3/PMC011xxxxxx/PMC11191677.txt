For the excitation to a repulsive state of a diatomic molecule, one expects a single broad peak in the photodissociation spectrum. For Zn2+, however, two peaks for the spin- and symmetry-allowed A2Σg+ ← X2Σu+ transition are observed. A detailed quantum-chemical analysis reveals pronounced multiconfigurational character of the A2Σg+ state. The σg(4s)2σg(4p) configuration with bond order 1.5 dominates at short distances, while the repulsive σg(4s)σu*(4s)2 configuration with bond order −0.5 wins over with increasing bond length. The two excited-state configurations contribute with opposite signs to the transition dipole moment, which reaches zero near the equilibrium distance. This local minimum of the oscillator strength is responsible for the pronounced dip in the photodissociation spectrum, which is thus the spectroscopic signature of the multiconfigurational character of the A2Σg+ state.

pmcMetal dimers have been studied extensively as model systems for chemical bonding.1 They exhibit a wide range of bonding patterns, from the weak van der Waals bond found in Zn2 with a formal bond order of zero2,3 to strong covalent bonding in Cr2 with a formal bond order of 6.4−7 Despite the small polarizability of beryllium atoms, Be2 is significantly more strongly bound than Zn2, with spectroscopic constants De(Be2) = 930 ± 2 cm–1 versus De(Zn2) = 215 ± 1 cm–1.3,8 This somewhat surprising experimental result is due to the multiconfigurational character of the electronic wave function in both molecules and subtle stabilizing and destabilizing effects, which have been analyzed and documented in numerous publications, mostly on Be2.8,9 Despite its success in describing relative energies of electronic states and predicting bond lengths, the concept of multiconfigurational wave functions10,11 remains elusive, since their existence is mainly deduced from quantum-chemical calculations. Electronic absorption spectra by themselves do not reveal directly whether a multiconfigurational wave function is involved.

Upon removal of an electron, the resulting Be2+ has a formal bond order of 0.5 and a 2Σu+ ground state.12,13 No experimental spectroscopic data are available for Zn2+. Gutsev and Bauschlicher showed with density functional theory (DFT) calculations that the dimer has a filled σg(4s) orbital and a half-filled σu*(4s) orbital,14 resulting in a bond order of 0.5 for the 2Σu+ ground state, as illustrated in Scheme 1. Two excited-state configurations with 2Σg+ symmetry can be reached by exciting either an α or β electron. In the β-electron-excited configuration σg(4s)σu*(4s)2, the formal bond order is reduced to −0.5, while the α-electron-excited configuration σg(4s)2σg(4p) results in a formal bond order of 1.5.

Scheme 1 Molecular Orbital Diagram of Zn2+

Electrons in the 2Σu+ ground-state configuration are shown with black arrows. Excitation of an α (red) or β (blue) electron results in a 2Σg+ excited state.

We recently performed infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy of hydrated Zn2+(H2O)n in the gas phase,15 showing that the zinc dimer resides on the surface of the water clusters, similar to Zn+(H2O)n.16,17 Here we examine the stability and electronic structure of the unsolvated Zn2+ dimer by photodissociation spectroscopy. The simple molecular orbital (MO) picture in Scheme 1 suggests that excitation to the repulsive σg(4s)σu*(4s)2 configuration would result in one broad peak in the photodissociation spectrum, characteristic of excitation to a dissociative state in diatomic molecules. However, we observe a pronounced dip in the broad peak, which is caused by the multiconfigurational character of the repulsive A2Σg+ state.

Photodissociation spectroscopy was performed on a 4.7 T FT-ICR mass spectrometer,18,19 with Zn2+ ions obtained by laser vaporization,20−22 using a tunable pulsed OPO laser system for irradiation. Over the studied photon energy range of 1.9 to 5.5 eV, the photodissociation signal was observed mainly between 2.3 and 3.1 eV, with a prominent peak centered at 2.92 eV and a weaker one at 2.57 eV (see Figure 1). Weak features near the detection limit can also be found for energies above 4.5 eV, indicating a contribution of higher-lying excited states. The split peak cannot be caused by spin–orbit splitting, since Σ states do not split. Another common explanation would be the vibrational excitation of a fraction of the Zn2+ ions in the electronic ground state. However, the calculated vibrational excitation energy of Zn2+ is 20 meV, while the peak separation is 350 meV, a total mismatch.

Figure 1 Experimental photodissociation spectrum of Zn2+.

To understand the reason for the split peak, we calculated the excited-state potential curves of Zn2+ at various levels of theory, as shown in Figure 2a. Coupled cluster singles, doubles, and noniteratively included triples (CCSD, CCSD(T)), equation of motion CCSD (EOM-CCSD), and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were performed with Gaussian 16,23 and multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations were carried out with MOLPRO.24 As expected from the MO picture in Scheme 1, a low-lying repulsive A2Σg+ state is present. The lowest-lying bound excited state B2Πu results from the parity-forbidden πu(4p) ← σu*(4s) transition. Three higher-lying states are available in the studied energy range, but they only produce a weak photodissociation signal since excitation from the ground state is only allowed into the bound C2Σg+ and D2Πg states (see Table S3). Since the potential curves do not provide a pathway for dissociation in these states, the absorption of a second photon within the same laser pulse is the most plausible explanation for the observed weak photodissociation signal at higher energies. A contribution of the B2Πu or E2Σu+ state to the photodissociation signal can be ruled out, as the transition from the ground state is parity-forbidden and switching between the B2Πu and A2Σg+ potential curves is prohibited by their symmetry mismatch.

Figure 2 (a) Potential curves of the ground and first five excited states of Zn2+ at various levels of theory (MRCI/aug-cc-pVQZ, EOM-CCSD(full)/aug-cc-pVQZ, TD-CAMB3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ, CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ). (b) Oscillator strength of the A2Σg+ ← X2Σu+ transition as a function of bond length R along with the empirically shifted EOM-CCSD curve. (c) Experimental spectrum and the simulated spectrum with the empirically shifted oscillator strength, the thermalized ground-state density, and the zero-point-corrected excitation energy. (d) Contributions of the α and β electron excitations and resulting transition dipole moment as calculated at the TD-CAMB3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory.

To simulate the peak shape with the reflection principle,25−27 we calculated the transition dipole moment for the transition from the X2Σu+ ground state to the A2Σg+ excited state as a function of the Zn–Zn distance R, as shown in Figure 2d. On all levels of theory, the transition dipole moment consistently reaches zero near the equilibrium bond length of Zn2+ and rises toward the classical turning points of the zero-point vibration, with a steeper increase for the compressed molecule.

Using these results, we simulated the photodissociation spectrum, as shown in Figure 2c. The reflection principle requires a realistic ground-state vibrational density, which we modeled by solving the Schrödinger equation and accounting for the thermal population of the vibrational mode (see the Supporting Information (SI) for details). With the calculated transition dipole moments and excitation energies as a function of R, we indeed obtain the observed split peak as shown in Figure 2c (see the SI for additional details). The separation between the two peak maxima is reproduced faithfully on all theory levels; the position of the intensity minimum, however, deviates from experiment and is very sensitive to the theory level employed for the calculation of the oscillator strength. To reproduce the experiment, we shifted the minimum of the oscillator strength by 0.06 Å to smaller R, which translates to a shift of 0.04 eV in excitation energy, well below the expected error of the excited-state calculation.

To analyze the strong dependence of the oscillator strength on the Zn–Zn distance, we take a closer look at the character of the transitions and the involved MOs. Natural transition orbitals (NTOs) obtained by TDDFT are shown in Figure 3a, calculated at R = 2.65 Å, close to the oscillator strength minimum. Consistent with EOM-CCSD as well as MRCI calculations, we find that both the α-electron-excited configuration σg(4s)2σg(4p) and the β-electron-excited configuration σg(4s)σu*(4s)2 shown in Scheme 1 contribute to the A2Σg+ excited state, i.e., the state has a pronounced multiconfigurational character. The coefficients listed in Table 1 show that the α-electron excitation dominates at short distances R, while the β-electron excitation takes over at longer R. This makes sense since a higher population of the bonding σg(4p) MO is energetically favorable at short distances, while the antibonding σu*(4s) MO is inherently lower in energy for higher values of R because the 4s atomic orbitals (AOs) lie energetically well below the 4p AOs. The higher-lying C2Σg+ state corresponds to a complementary combination of the two configurations. Here, the repulsive β-electron excitation dominates at small R, while the attractive α-electron excitation turns C2Σg+ into a bound state at large R.

a The values were calculated at the TD-CAMB3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. The oscillator strength is also provided at the EOMCCSD(full)/aug-cc-pVQZ level (fTD and fEOM, respectively).

In the next step, we link the multiconfigurational character of the A2Σg+ state to the minimum of the oscillator strength. Neglecting small contributions from other configurations, we obtain the oscillator strength fit between initial state i and target state t from eq 1:1

where me is the electron mass, Et – Ei is the excitation energy, and cα and cβ are the coefficients of the α- and β-electron excitations given in Table 1, which depend strongly on R. ⟨ψκt|μz|ψκi⟩ are transition dipole moments with the ground-state (initial) wave functions ψαi and ψβi and excited-state (target) wave functions ψαt and ψβt. As the transition dipole moments for the α- and β-electron transitions are positive and negative, respectively, for all R, the sum necessarily changes sign while going from short to long R, reaching zero in between (see Table 1 and Figure 2d).

Figure 3 illustrates why the transition dipole moments of the α- and β-electron transitions have different sign. The α-electron transition dipole moment is dominated by the positive lobes of the σg(4p) target MO (Figure 3b), while the sign of the β-electron transition dipole moment is determined by the mostly negative σg(4s) initial MO (Figure 3a). In other words, the different phases of these two MOs in the regions that contribute most to the transition dipole moment are responsible for the different signs and cause the annihilation of the oscillator strength at a specific value of R.

The mixing of the σg(4s)σu*(4s)2 and σg(4s)2σg(4p) configurations that dominate the A2Σg+ state of Zn2+ is reminiscent of the multiconfigurational ground state of the intensively studied beryllium dimer Be2.8 In both cases, the difference in energy between the outer s and p orbitals is very small.28 For Be2, this affects the X2Σu+ ground state, while for Zn2+, we see the effect in the A2Σg+ excited state. The Be dimer, a seemingly simple system with only eight electrons, has posed considerable challenges for quantum chemistry. Up to its first experimental characterization by Bondybey and English,29 it was long a mystery whether it was a bound system at all.30 Interestingly, a strongly distance-dependent oscillator strength was predicted in a theoretical study of Be2+,12 also for the A2Σg+ ← X2Σu+ transition. Despite the multiconfigurational character of the A2Σg+ state of Zn2+, our results are quite robust with respect to the theory level. All calculations, including TDDFT, reproduce the mixing of the configurations (also see the SI). The deviations in energy and structure are in the typical ranges for excited-state calculations.

The photodissociation spectrum of the zinc dimer cation exhibits two well-separated peak maxima, which arise from electronic excitation to the same repulsive state, A2Σg+. The reason for the local disappearance of absorption intensity lies in the strong dependence of the transition dipole moment on the Zn–Zn bond length, which in turn arises from the multiconfigurational character of the A2Σg+ state. The resulting dip in the photodissociation peak is the unique signature of the multiconfigurational wave function of the A2Σg+ state. It may serve as a sensitive experimental benchmark for the construction of multiconfigurational wave functions, since the position of the dip relies on the delicate balance of the contributing configurations.
