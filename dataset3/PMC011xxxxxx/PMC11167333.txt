We present a genome assembly from an individual female Hirtodrosophila cameraria (a drosophilid fruit fly; Arthropoda; Insecta; Diptera; Drosophilidae). The genome sequence is 214.5 megabases in span. Most of the assembly is scaffolded into 4 chromosomal pseudomolecules. The mitochondrial genome has also been assembled and is 15.94 kilobases in length.

Background

Hirtodrosophila cameraria ( Haliday, 1833) is a medium sized (2.5–3.5 mm) pale greyish-brown drosophilid ‘fruit fly’ ( Figure 1A and B), distantly related to the laboratory model Drosophila melanogaster. It is one of three British and Irish species currently classified in the genus Hirtodrosophila ( Chandler, 2023). Originally placed in the genus Drosophila by Haliday, it was moved to the newly-elevated (sub-)genus Hirtodrosophila ( Grimaldi, 1990) by Bächli et al. (2004). However, relationships between Drosophila and Hirtodrosophila remain unclear, with the genera being paraphyletic with respect to each other and Zygothrica and Mycodrosophila, and with no single diagnostic morphological character available to separate them ( Bächli et al., 2004; Finet et al., 2021; Gautério et al., 2020; Grimaldi, 1990). Nevertheless, H. cameraria itself is easy to identify among other similar British and Irish drosophilids, having plumose aristae with a single ventral branch behind the terminal fork and lacking a pre-apical seta on the mesotibia ( Bächli et al., 2004).

Like its close relatives, H. cameraria is a specialist fungus breeder and in the UK the adults are easily collected or reared from toadstools and bracket fungi, including Phallus impudicus, Lactarius quietus, Amanita rubescens, Russula cyanorantha and Paxillus ( Charlesworth & Shorrocks, 1980; Gautério et al., 2020; Shorrocks & Charlesworth, 1980). Adults have also been reported in association with the violet helleborine orchid Epipactis purpurata ( Roper, 2013), perhaps as a result of pheromones released by the plant to attract pollinators ( Policha et al., 2019). Hirtodrosophila cameraria is broadly distributed in wooded areas across Europe, from the extreme north of Sweden, to Turkey in the east, and the Canary islands in the south west ( Bächli, 2023). In the UK, breeding is likely to be focused of toadstool flushes in the late summer and early autumn ( Charlesworth & Shorrocks, 1980), but adults can be caught at any time of year ( Basden, 1954), and are quite commonly recorded in the months of May to November ( GBIF Secretariat, 2022). It is not thought to be threatened and is in fact likely under-collected compared to its human-commensal relatives, as it rarely comes to fruit bait ( Basden, 1954).

Here we present a chromosomally complete genome sequence for Hirtodrosophila cameraria, derived from the DNA of two female specimens that were collected from a bracket fungus in the Hermitage of Braid, Edinburgh, as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project. This genome sequence will help to resolve relationships among the Drosophilidae and will further build on the value of this family as a model clade for comparative genomics and molecular evolution. This project is a collaborative effort to sequence all named eukaryotic species in the Atlantic Archipelago of Britain and Ireland.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one female Hirtodrosophila cameraria ( Figure 1C) collected from Hermitage of Braid, Edinburgh, Scotland (55.92, –3.20). A total of 45-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 78 missing joins or misjoins and removed 5 haplotypic duplications, reducing the assembly length by 0.32% and the scaffold number by 52.38%, and increasing the scaffold N50 by 101.28%.

The final assembly has a total length of 214.5 Mb in 39 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 82.8 Mb ( Table 1). Most (98.38%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 4 chromosomal-level scaffolds. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 2– Figure 5; Table 2). We did not identify the sex chromosome(s) as sequence data from the heterogametic sex was not available and homology is unreliable for sex chromosome identification in Diptera due to frequent sex chromosome turnover ( Vicoso & Bachtrog, 2015). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

The specimen used for genome sequencing was a female Hirtodrosophila cameraria (biospecimen ID SAMEA12110596, individual idHirCame2; Figure 1C). The specimen used for Hi-C scaffolding was a female Hirtodrosophila cameraria (biospecimen ID SAMEA12110595, individual idHirCame1; Figure 1C). Both specimens were collected from Hermitage of Braid, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK (latitude 55.92, longitude –3.20) on 2021-10-04. The specimens were aspirated from a bracket fungus on a deciduous tree stump in an urban woodland. The anaesthetised flies were placed directly into collection tube, and frozen from live at –80°C. The specimens were collected and identified by Darren Obbard (University of Edinburgh).

DNA was extracted at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The idHirCame2 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice. Tissue from the whole organism was disrupted using a Nippi Powermasher fitted with a BioMasher pestle. High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted using the Qiagen MagAttract HMW DNA extraction kit. HMW DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30. Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation using AMPure PB beads with a 1.8X ratio of beads to sample to remove the shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA sample. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on a Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) instrument. Hi-C data were also generated from whole organism tissue of idHirCame1 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.
