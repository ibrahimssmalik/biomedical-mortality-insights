Background

Sisyra nigra, the Black Spongefly, or Spongillafly in North America, is a fascinating lacewing. The larvae eat freshwater sponges of the genera Ephydatia and Spongilla in lakes, ponds and slow-moving rivers ( Plant, 1997), apparently with little host specificity towards the sponges ( Poirrier, 1969). The female spongefly lays eggs on branches overhanging the water and the larvae are fully aquatic, at first free-swimming and then feeding within the sponge tissue, with many morphological and physiological adaptations to their unique niche ( Jandausch et al., 2019). Pupation is on land. Adults disperse from water bodies and on overcast, humid nights can be light-trapped some distance from waterbodies, as was the case with these specimens collected for sequencing. Adults of Sisyra nigra are basically black, with an infuscate wing membrane, are small (about 5 mm long) and rest in a typical lacewing fashion, with the wings held in a tent-like shape over the body. They are mostly carnivorous, feeding on mites, insect eggs and sometimes aphids, as well as honeydew ( Devetak & Klokočovnik, 2016).

A Holarctic species ( Bowles, 2006), Sisyra nigra is one of only three British species of the family Sisyridae, all in the genus Sisyra, and is by the far the most widely distributed within Britain ( NBN Atlas Partnership, 2023; Plant, 1997). The combination of the entirely dark antennae and fore wings distinguishes S. nigra from the other two British species ( Plant, 1997). This is the first genome for a species of Sisyridae and as such will help towards piecing together the evolution and radiation of the Neuroptera, an ancient insect order with diverse life histories.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one female Sisyra nigra ( Figure 1) collected from Kent, Tonbridge, Kent, UK (51.19, 0.29). A total of 55-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 117 missing joins or mis-joins and removed 49 haplotypic duplications, reducing the assembly length by 2.16% and the scaffold number by 31.71%, and increasing the scaffold N50 by 0.43%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Sisyra nigra (inSisNigr1) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 372.6 Mb in 111 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 50.8 Mb ( Table 1). The snailplot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of assembly scaffolds on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (95.76%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 7 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 6 autosomes and the X sex chromosome. The X chromosome was identified based on reduced Hi-C signal (PacBio from female, Hi-C appears to be from male). An inversion between 20 Mb and 22 Mb on Chromosome 1 likely corresponds to difference between samples used for PacBio and Hi-C. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

A female Sisyra nigra (specimen ID NHMUK010634999, ToLID inSisNigr1) was collected in a light trap in Tonbridge, Kent, UK (latitude 51.19, longitude 0.29) on 2020-06-24. The specimen was collected and identified by Gavin Broad (Natural History Museum) and kept in DESS for 2 weeks before being frozen at –80°C.

The specimen used for Hi-C and RNA sequencing (specimen ID Ox002595, ToLID inSisNigr2) was collected using a sweep net in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire (biological vice-county Berkshire), UK (latitude 51.77, longitude –1.34) on 2022-08-01. The specimen was collected by Liam Crowley and James McCulloch (University of Oxford) and identified by James McCulloch (University of Oxford).

High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI), following a sequence of core procedures: sample preparation; sample homogenisation; HMW DNA extraction; HMW DNA fragmentation; and fragmented DNA clean-up. The inSisNigr1 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice (as per the protocol at https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.x54v9prmqg3e/v1). Tissue from the whole organism was disrupted using a Nippi Powermasher fitted with a BioMasher pestle ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.5qpvo3r19v4o/v1). HMW DNA was extracted by means of the Manual MagAttract protocol ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.6qpvr33novmk/v1). HMW DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30, following the HMW DNA Fragmentation: Diagenode Megaruptor®3 for PacBio HiFi protocol ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.8epv5x2zjg1b/v1). Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation (SPRI) ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.kxygx3y1dg8j/v1). In brief, the method employs a 1.8X ratio of AMPure PB beads to sample to eliminate shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

RNA was extracted from inSisNigr2 in the Tree of Life Laboratory at the WSI using the RNA Extraction: Automated MagMax™ mirVana protocol ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.6qpvr36n3vmk/v1). The RNA concentration was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit RNA Broad-Range (BR) Assay kit. Analysis of the integrity of the RNA was done using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit and Eukaryotic Total RNA assay.

All protocols developed by the Tree of Life laboratory are publicly available on protocols.io: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.8epv5xxy6g1b/v1.

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Poly(A) RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the NEB Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit. DNA and RNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (RNA-Seq) instruments. Hi-C data were generated from tissue of inSisNigr2 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected using the TreeVal pipeline ( Pointon et al., 2022). Manual curation was performed using using JBrowse2 ( Diesh et al., 2023), HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

The experiment combined sophisticated methodologies to ensure a reliable and high-quality assembly of the Sisyra nigra genome. It represents the first whole genome assembly of Sisyra nigra, offering valuable data for potential biological investigations and comparative genomics analyses. 

In the abstract, the authors mentioned that the mitogenome was also assembled. So, it is necessary to explicitly state more about the mitogenome, indicating whether it is complete or not.

The authors introduced the significance of this spongefly species and emphasized the outstanding aquatic adaptation of Sisyridae. However, the authors should recheck the distribution of Sisyra nigra, as there seems to be some confusion regarding whether it is distributed in North America, the Holarctic region, or elsewhere.
