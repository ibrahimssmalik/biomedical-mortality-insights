Key Points

Question

Is the sex outcomes disparity for Medicare beneficiaries undergoing high-risk surgery associated with the quality of hospital where beneficiaries receive care?

Findings

In this retrospective cohort study of 444 855 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, female patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were more likely to receive care at low-quality hospitals where the sex disparity in mortality doubled that of high-quality hospitals.

Meaning

Quality improvement targeting low-quality hospitals as well as equitable referral of female beneficiaries to higher-quality hospitals may narrow the sex disparity after coronary artery bypass grafting.

This cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries evaluates the association between hospital quality and sex disparities in mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting.

Importance

Concern has been raised about persistent sex disparities after coronary artery bypass grafting, with female patients having higher mortality. However, whether these disparities persist across hospitals of different qualities is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate sex disparities in 30-day mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting across high- and low-quality hospitals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional, retrospective cohort study evaluated Medicare beneficiaries undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting between October 1, 2015, and March 31, 2020. Data analysis was performed from July 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023.

Exposures

The primary exposures were hospital quality and sex. For hospital quality, hospitals were placed into rank order by their overall risk-adjusted mortality rate and divided into quintiles.

Main Outcome and Measures

Risk-adjusted 30-day mortality using a logistic regression model accounting for patient factors, including sex, age, comorbidities, elective vs unplanned admission, number of bypass grafts, use of arterial graft, and year of surgery.

Results

A total of 444 855 beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 71.5 [7.5] years; 120 333 [27.1%] female and 324 522 [72.9%] male) were studied. Compared with male beneficiaries, female beneficiaries were more likely to have an unplanned admission (66 425 [55.2%] vs 157 895 [48.7%], P < .001) and receive care at low-quality (vs high-quality) hospitals (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.23-1.29; P < .001). Overall, risk-adjusted female mortality was 4.24% (95% CI, 4.20%-4.27%), and male mortality was 2.75% (95% CI, 2.75%-2.77%), with an absolute difference of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.45-1.51) percentage points (P < .001). At the highest-quality hospitals, male mortality was 1.57% (95% CI, 1.56%-1.59%), and female mortality was 2.58% (95% CI, 2.54%-2.62%), with an absolute difference of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-1.04) percentage points (P < .001). At the lowest-quality hospitals, male mortality was 4.94% (95% CI, 4.88%-5.01%), and female mortality was 7.02% (95% CI, 6.90%-7.13%), with an absolute difference of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.95-2.19) percentage points (P < .001). Female beneficiaries receiving care at low-quality hospitals had a higher mortality than male beneficiaries receiving care at the high-quality hospitals (7.02% vs 1.57%, P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, female beneficiaries were more likely to receive care at low-quality hospitals, where the sex disparity in mortality was double that of high-quality hospitals. Quality improvement targeting low-quality hospitals as well as equitable referral of female beneficiaries to higher-quality hospitals may narrow the sex disparity after coronary artery bypass grafting.
==== Body
pmcIntroduction

Health equity has long been identified as a priority from leading government agencies and health care societies.1,2,3 Increasingly, there have been national calls for greater focus on sex disparities, including efforts through the National Institutes of Health requiring the inclusion of both sexes in basic science and clinical trials to combat historic underinclusion of female patients in research and recent legislation from the White House that specifically prioritizes research in women’s health (The White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research).4,5 To eliminate disparities, government agencies have identified improving access to high-quality care as a possible policy lever.2

However, the association of hospital quality with sex disparities is not well understood. A particular blind spot exists with high-risk surgery, such as coronary artery bypass grafting, for which female patients have had significantly higher mortality than male patients for decades.6,7,8,9 On one hand, the sex disparity may be consistent regardless of hospital quality and more attributable to patient-specific risk factors.10,11 Alternatively, the sex disparity may widen as hospital quality worsens. If hospital quality contributes to worse outcomes in female patients, policy could be enacted to have targeted quality improvement at low-quality hospitals or more equitably refer female patients to higher-quality hospitals to narrow the disparity.12

In that context, we designed a national study of Medicare beneficiaries undergoing high-risk surgery to evaluate the association of sex disparities with hospital quality. In particular, we sought to stratify hospitals into quintiles of quality to compare where patients receive care and evaluate whether outcome disparities changed across hospital quality.

Methods

Data Source and Cohort Selection

All Medicare beneficiaries undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting from October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2020, were identified using 100% claims data from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) file, including fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries with at least 3 months of continuous enrollment before surgery and 12 months of enrollment after surgery were included. Coronary artery bypass grafting was selected because it is one of the most common high-risk operations performed nationally and there are known, persistent sex disparities.6,7 Moreover, coronary artery bypass grafting has also been a model high-risk procedure that health care systems and regulatory health agencies (ie, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS]) continue to target for quality improvement.13 Procedure codes from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) were used to define the cohort (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Patient demographics and comorbidities were collected. In Medicare, race and ethnicity are identified through self-report, and categories include Asian, Black, Hispanic, North American Native, White, and other. Race and ethnicity are included in this study as a social construct and not as a biological risk factor. Data on race and ethnicity were collected to evaluate how intersectional identities (eg, Black female vs White male) may affect mortality. Hospital characteristics, including hospital size, nurse to patient ratio, and teaching status, were linked to the MEDPAR file with unique hospital identifiers from the American Hospital Association annual survey.14 Among the data presented in this study, the only variable with missingness was race (n = 7609 [1.8%]), which was labeled as “unknown.” Because race is not included in this risk adjustment, all identified beneficiaries were included. This study was determined to be exempt from review by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board because it was no more than minimal risk. Patient consent was waived by the institutional review board because all data were deidentified. This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.

Outcome

The primary outcome in this study was 30-day mortality, which included in-hospital mortality and death within 30 days postoperatively. In-hospital mortality was identified with vital status at time of discharge. Deaths occurring within 30 days of the index operation but outside the hospital were identified using the Medicare Denominator File. All follow-up for 30-day mortality was 100% complete.

Hospital Quality

Hospital quality was defined by placing hospitals into quintiles by their risk-adjusted rate of 30-day mortality. Hospitals in the quintile with the lowest 30-day mortality were characterized as highest quality, and hospitals in the quintile with the highest 30-day mortality were characterized as lowest quality.

The study used 30-day mortality rates to determine hospital quality for several reasons. First, it is an established approach used in several prior studies evaluating surgical quality at the hospital level.12,15,16,17,18,19 Second, coronary artery bypass grafting mortality is a core measure in national hospital quality ratings used by the CMS.20 Third, 30-day mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting is validated by the National Quality Forum and other leading national organizations (ie, Society of Thoracic Surgeons).21,22 Fourth, other quality measures, such as the CMS star ratings, have significant missingness and miss 20% to 26% of hospitals nationally.23 Given this, we used each hospital’s risk-adjusted coronary artery bypass graft mortality because it is a validated quality measure and would be inclusive of all patients in our dataset.

Statistical Analysis

The overall goal of this analysis was to evaluate the association between hospital quality and sex disparities among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. First, patient demographics were compared by sex. Continuous variables were normally distributed and are presented as mean (SD) and compared with a 2-tailed t test. Categorical variables are presented as number (percentage) and compared using the χ2 test.

Second, the quintiles of hospital quality were established. To do this, a 2-tier hierarchical logistic regression was performed to calculate risk-adjusted 30-day mortality, accounting for variation in patient population across different hospitals. With the use of a well-established risk-adjustment model, a cross-sectional comparison of the entire cohort was performed using a logistic regression adjusting for age, 27 comorbidities, surgery year, admission type (elective vs unplanned), number of coronary artery bypass grafts, and use of arterial grafts.24,25,26,27 Surgery year was included as a categorical model to account for secular trends. Use of an arterial graft was determined using ICD-10 codes (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). The number of bypass grafts indicated by each ICD-10 code was summed across the first 25 procedure codes to determine the total number of bypass grafts performed. Patient sex was interacted with the terms of the model, allowing the coefficients to vary by sex, to account for the different ways male and female patients experience the health care system. Hospital characteristics were not included in the model because hospital was part of the exposure, although the coefficient of sex was allowed to vary at the hospital level. Robust SEs were applied to all outcome estimates to account for clustering of patients within hospitals.

After identification of quintiles of hospital quality, hospital characteristics were compared across the different quintiles. Continuous variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorial variables are presented as number (percentage), normally distributed variables are presented as mean (SD), and skewed variables are presented as median (IQR). Hospital characteristics were compared using the χ2 test, 2-tailed t test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. Finally, differences in 30-day mortality by sex were described across high- and low-quality hospitals.

Several sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of our findings. First, hospital quality was also determined by mortality rates of male beneficiaries only to address the potential endogeneity of defining hospital quality by postoperative mortality and comparing mortality rates by sex. Second, the percentage of female patients at each hospital was included in the model to account for different patient populations treated, which may influence overall hospital mortality. Data analysis was performed from July 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023. All analyses were performed using Stata MP software, version 16.1 (StatCorp LLC). All hypothesis tests were 2-sided, and a significance level of P < .05 was used.

Results

Patient and Hospital Characteristics

Of 444 855 beneficiaries included, 324 522 (72.9%) were male and 120 333 (27.1%) were female. The mean (SD) age for both male and female patients was 71.5 (7.5) years (Table 1). Of the female beneficiaries, 2165 (1.8%) were Asian, 13 672 (11.4%) Black, 2537 (2.1%) Hispanic, 838 (0.7%) North American Native, 98 165 (81.6%) White, 1995 (1.7%) other, and 961 (0.8%) of unknown race and ethnicity. Of the male beneficiaries, 5703 (1.8%) were Asian, 18 284 (5.3%) Black, 6087 (1.9%) Hispanic, 1637 (0.5%) North American Native, 278 628 (85.9%) White, 7275 (2.2%) other, and 6908 (2.1%) of unknown race and ethnicity. Additionally, female beneficiaries had more comorbidities than male beneficiaries (≥2 Elixhauser comorbidities: 110 254 [91.6%] vs 277 721 [85.6%], P < .001) and were more likely to have an unplanned surgery (66 425 [55.2%] vs 157 895 [48.7%], P < .001). Operatively, female beneficiaries received fewer bypass grafts than male beneficiaries and were less likely to receive an arterial conduit.

Hospital Characteristics

Hospital characteristics differed across the quintiles of hospital quality. The lowest-quality hospitals were more likely to be for-profit hospitals and had the lowest nurse to patient ratio, the smallest hospital bed size, and the lowest coronary artery bypass grafting volume per hospital (Table 2). Although fewer patients went to low-quality hospitals than high-quality hospitals, the lowest-quality hospitals had the highest proportion of female beneficiaries (Table 3). Female beneficiaries had 26% higher odds of receiving care at the lowest-quality hospitals vs the highest-quality hospitals (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.23-1.29; P < .001).

The quintile with the lowest 30-day mortality was deemed “highest quality,” and the quintile with the highest 30-day mortality was deemed “lowest quality.” Risk adjustment included patient characteristics (ie, age, sex, and comorbidities) and operative characteristics (ie, number of bypass grafts). The absolute difference was calculated by subtracting male beneficiaries’ risk-adjusted rate of 30-day mortality from female beneficiaries’ risk-adjusted rate of 30-day mortality (ie, female – male). The difference in distribution of female beneficiaries across hospital quality was significant (P < .001). The difference in mortality by sex was significant across all levels of hospital quality (P < .001).

Interaction Among Hospital Quality, Sex, and 30-Day Mortality

Overall, risk-adjusted female mortality was 4.24% (95% CI, 4.20%-4.27%), and male mortality was 2.75% (95% CI, 2.75%-2.77%), with an absolute difference of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.45-1.51) percentage points (P < .001). The sex disparity in mortality increased as hospital quality worsened. At the highest-quality hospitals, male mortality was 1.57% (95% CI, 1.56%-1.59%), and female mortality was 2.58% (95% CI, 2.54%-2.62%), with an absolute difference of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-1.04) percentage points (P < .001) (Figure 1). At the lowest-quality hospitals, male mortality was 4.94% (95% CI, 4.88%-5.01%), and female mortality was 7.02% (95% CI, 6.90%-7.13%), with an absolute difference of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.95-2.19) percentage points (P < .001). In other words, female beneficiaries receiving care at the lowest-quality hospitals had a greater than 4-fold higher mortality than male beneficiaries receiving care at the highest-quality hospitals (7.02% vs 1.57%) (Figure 2).

The results of the sensitivity analyses mirror our main findings. These data are provided in eTables 3 and 4 in Supplement 1.

Discussion

In this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting from 2015 to 2020, female beneficiaries were more likely to receive care at low-quality hospitals, and the sex disparity in 30-day mortality increased as hospital quality worsened. There was a doubling in the disparity from high-quality to low-quality hospitals. Taken together, our findings suggest that policy focused on quality improvement for low-quality hospitals and more equitable referral of female beneficiaries to high-quality hospitals may narrow sex mortality disparities after high-risk surgery.

Prior work has found that hospital quality contributes to outcomes disparities. Several groups have found that Black patients are more likely to undergo surgery at low-quality hospitals with higher postoperative mortality.12,28,31,32 Similarly, recent work found that Medicare beneficiaries from areas with highest neighborhood deprivation were more likely to undergo surgery at the lowest-quality hospitals.29 Moreover, beneficiaries from the highest deprivation areas who received care at the lowest-quality hospitals had nearly triple the mortality of beneficiaries from the lowest deprivation areas who received care at the highest-quality hospitals.29 Our work builds on these important studies by demonstrating how hospital quality impacts sex outcomes disparities. Although there have been recent calls to action to resolve sex outcome disparities after high-risk surgery,33,34 the role of hospital quality on sex disparities has not been examined before in a large, nationally representative cohort.

Although the mechanisms underlying the persistent sex disparities are difficult to elucidate, our findings point toward multiple plausible mechanisms. First, female beneficiaries are a higher-risk population than male beneficiaries (eFigure in Supplement 1). In this study, female beneficiaries were more likely to have an unplanned (vs elective) admission and had a higher comorbidity burden than male beneficiaries, supporting prior findings35,36 that female beneficiaries with coronary artery disease are referred later for surgery. This later disease presentation may be due to understudied biological differences driving female patients’ later presentation with coronary artery disease but also reflects that ischemic heart disease in female patients is underdiagnosed and undertreated.35,36 Moreover, once female patients are diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, they are less likely to receive guideline-directed medical therapy and have longer delays in time to revascularization.37 Together, these factors contribute to higher-acuity presentation in female patients. High-quality hospitals may manage these risk factors more effectively and have more resources available to provide state-of-the-art care to this higher-risk population.38,39

Hospital annual procedural volume may also contribute to the disparity in outcomes among male and female patients. Prior work in cardiac procedures has demonstrated a clear volume-outcomes relationship, with higher-volume centers demonstrating better surgical outcomes.40,41 In the current study, female patients were more likely to undergo their procedures at lower-volume hospitals and were less likely to receive arterial grafting, which is a more technically challenging revascularization strategy but associated with superior outcomes.42,43 Specialty care at a high-volume hospital may be particularly relevant for female patients, who often have smaller anatomy, making coronary artery bypass grafting more difficult.42,44 Indeed, it is probably a synergistic combination of both patient risk and hospital experience that leads to the outcome differences by sex across quality. High-quality hospitals may be better equipped to care for female patients, who are a higher-risk and more technically challenging patient population than their male counterparts.

Our findings have several policy implications. First, equitable referral of female patients to high-quality hospitals may narrow sex outcome disparities after high-risk surgery. The rationale underscoring this recommendation is seen both in our data as well as in national calls for female-specific centers of excellence for coronary artery bypass grafting.33,34 Building on this, in light of evidence that surgeon and patient sex concordance improves outcomes specifically for female patients, practitioner-level policies aimed at improving gender diversity in cardiothoracic surgery, where more than 90% of practicing cardiothoracic surgeons are male, could narrow this disparity.45,46 Second, as is apparent from the geographic heterogeneity in hospital quality in this study, where high-quality hospitals were concentrated in the North and low-quality hospitals were concentrated in the South, access to high-quality hospitals is not uniform, and equitable referral alone cannot resolve the sex disparity. In conjunction with referral patterns, targeted improvement for low-quality hospitals may be a needed strategy to eliminate sex-based disparities after surgery.12 Doing so, however, would first require a uniform commitment of hospitals to measure sex disparities in high-risk groups.47 Currently, there are no such requirements from payers or policymakers at the national level. Third, because there is increasing national interest in sex outcomes disparities and leveraging hospital quality to narrow those disparities, our findings are timely.2,3,4 Policy could specifically target sex disparities as a quality measure or incentivize equitable referral to higher-quality centers.

Limitations

This work has several limitations. First, this study uses administrative claims data, which lack the clinical granularity of registry data. To mitigate this, we chose a primary outcome, 30-day mortality, that can be identified in claims data as accurately as registry data.7,48 Additionally, the sex disparity after coronary artery bypass grafting has been described using both claims data and clinical granular registry data (ie, Society of Thoracic Surgeons database) and is pervasive regardless of the dataset used, so this is not a unique finding to this claims-based analysis. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the findings of this study (exploring the sex disparity as a function of hospital quality) are entirely attributable to the use of claims data, although replication in a more clinically granular dataset would be informative. Second, only Medicare beneficiaries who were 65 years or older were included in this study, which may limit generalizability to other populations undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. However, most patients who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting are older than 65 years and qualify for Medicare; thus, they are represented in this study. Although the sex disparity after coronary artery bypass grafting is pervasive regardless of age, in some work, the sex disparity is magnified in younger populations, and understanding the role of hospital quality could help to achieve equity for all age groups.5,8,42 Finally, 30-day mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting may not be an accurate representative for hospital quality. However, 30-day mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting is a validated quality measure by the National Quality Foundation and is used as a quality measure by national cardiac surgery societies and national hospital ranking methods. Additionally, 30-day mortality is commonly used in surgical quality research.12,17,18,19,20,21,30 Future work could examine other markers of hospital quality to further explore how hospital-level factors contribute to the sex disparity after coronary artery bypass grafting.

Conclusions

In this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, female beneficiaries had higher 30-day mortality than male beneficiaries, a disparity that increased as hospital quality worsened. Additionally, female beneficiaries were more concentrated at low-quality centers. Policy aimed at equitable referral of female patients to high-quality centers and targeted improvement of low-quality hospitals may narrow these disparities.
