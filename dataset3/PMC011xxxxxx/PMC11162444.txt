pmcCorrection to: Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 10.1038/s41392-024-01794-4, published online 15 April 2024

After the article was published online,1 the authors noticed one inadvertent mistake in Supplementary Fig. S19. The image of lung H&E in the Lip-Dox group was repeatedly inserted as the image of Dox group by mistake during the preparation of the figures. The correct figure was provided as follows. The correction did not affect any of our results or discussion presented in the original publication. We apologize for this inadvertent mistake.

The original article has been corrected.
