Simple Summary

To categorize carcasses into value classes aligning with consumer preferences and to guarantee equitable compensation for producers, as well as to furnish valuable data for scientific research, numerous technologies have been devised to assess carcass composition with ever-increasing accuracy and precision. One such technology is video image analysis (VIA), which has demonstrated promising outcomes, particularly in its application to cattle and sheep carcasses. This study focuses on employing a VIA methodology for evaluating light lamb carcasses, a segment that has received comparatively less attention from both research and industry.

Abstract

Over the years, numerous techniques have been explored to assess the composition and quality of sheep carcasses. This study focuses on the utilization of video image analysis (VIA) to evaluate the composition of light lamb carcasses (4.52 ± 1.34 kg, mean cold carcass weight ± SD). Photographic images capturing the lateral and dorsal sides of fifty-five light lamb carcasses were subjected to analysis. A comprehensive set of measurements was recorded, encompassing dimensions such as lengths, widths, angles, areas, and perimeters, totaling 21 measurements for the lateral view images and 29 for the dorsal view images. K-Folds stepwise multiple regression analyses were employed to construct prediction models for carcass tissue weights (including muscle, subcutaneous fat, intermuscular fat, and bone) and their respective percentages. The most effective prediction equations were established using data from cold carcass weight (CCW) and measurements from both dorsal and lateral views. These models accounted for a substantial portion of the observed variation in the weights of all carcass tissues (with K-fold-R2 ranging from 0.83 to 0.98). In terms of carcass tissue percentages, although the degree of variation explained was slightly lower (with K-fold-R2 ranging from 0.41 to 0.78), the VIA measurements remained integral to the predictive models. These findings underscore the efficacy of VIA as an objective tool for assessing the composition of light lamb carcasses, which are carcasses weighing ≈ 4–8 kg.

pmc1. Introduction

Scholz et al. [1] pointed out that accurate and precise evaluation of body or carcass composition is important for performance testing, grading, and the selection or payment of meat-producing animals, as well as for scientific studies on growth, nutrition, genetics, housing, and behavior or farm animal well-being. Sorting carcasses into value classes based on consumer preferences, producers can be rewarded for delivering carcasses that meet industry and consumer requirements [2,3,4]) and, feeding this information back from the abattoir to the producers and breeders, it can be used in genetic evaluations, what will increase the accuracy of estimated breeding values and rates of response to selection [5]. However, direct evaluation of carcass composition implies dissection and/or chemical analyses, which are destructive, time-consuming, expensive, and prone to error due to human fatigue [6], while traditional indirect techniques based on linear measures have shown poor prediction accuracy [7,8]. So, in the process of developing new technologies to assess carcass composition with increasing accuracy and precision, preference has been given to non-invasive procedures, relying mainly on the development of electronic and computer-based techniques in order to provide objective phenotypic data [1]. Since the Kansas State University won, in 1980, a project to develop a prototype VIA [9], several works have been carried out to understand and develop the potential of this technology as a non-destructive nor invasive alternative to allow an objective, quick and precise evaluation of the carcass without interfering with the production chain [10]. The evaluation of carcasses with the VIA systems is based on measurements of length, width, area, angle, volume, and color made on images obtained during processing operations. Such measurements can then be used to estimate traits such as carcass yield, lean meat yield, saleable meat yield, yield in pieces, and percentage of fat or carcass muscularity [11,12,13,14]. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential of a VIA technology to estimate the tissue composition of light lamb carcasses, developing prediction equations for carcass muscle, fat, and bone.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Animals and Carcasses

Light carcasses of the fifty-five lambs from the indigenous Portuguese Churra da Terra Quente (CTQ) breed, in accordance with the Borrego Terrincho–PDO specifications [15], were selected for this. Briefly, the Borrego Terrincho–PDO lamb comes from the Churra da Terra Quente breed in Northeast Portugal and is primarily bred for milk production and milk-fed lambs. These lambs are typically slaughtered at 4–6 weeks of age and yield carcasses weighing approximately 4–8 kg. European meat quality labels, such as “Borrego Terrincho”–PDO, are linked to specific regions and traditional production methods, providing a level of uniqueness. The animals were processed in an accredited slaughterhouse, adhering strictly to both National and European regulations. Following slaughter, the carcasses underwent refrigeration at 4 °C for 24 h, during which the cold carcass weight (CCW) was recorded (4.52 ± 1.34 kg, mean CCW ± SD).

2.2. Acquisition of VIA Images and Measurements

Photographic images capturing both the dorsal and left outer side of each carcass were obtained. For the left outer side images, carcasses were suspended against a black background and repositioned for dorsal images; precautions were taken to stabilize the carcasses prior to image capture. A Nikon D3100 digital camera (Nikon Inc., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an 8-megapixel sensor was used for image acquisition. The camera settings were manually configured: shutter speed at 1/60 s, aperture at F/4.5, ISO sensitivity set to 400, no flash, and a focal length of 26 mm. Images were saved in JPEG format. The entire process was conducted under consistent artificial lighting conditions and a fixed camera position, with the camera positioned 3 m from the carcasses.

To ensure scale accuracy, two red dots were projected onto each carcass using parallel lasers (wavelength: 650 nm) mounted on a frame with predetermined spacing. These dots served as reference points for scale-bar purposes. The captured images were then transferred to a computer for analysis. Image analysis was performed using Fiji software (ImageJ 1.49u) developed by Rasband [16]. A total of 50 VIA measurements were recorded, comprising 21 from lateral view images (Figure 1a–d) and 29 from dorsal view images (Figure 2a–d). These measurements included areas, perimeters, lengths, angles, and widths taken from various regions of the carcass. In the present study, we build upon the documented measurements of length, area, width, and angle from prior research utilizing VIA systems. Specifically, insights from studies conducted by Batista et al. [17], Ngo et al. [18], Oliver et al. [19], and Rius-Vilarrasa et al. [20] have informed our approach and methodology.

2.3. Carcass Jointing and Dissection

Following the delineation by Santos et al. [21], the half-carcasses underwent division into six distinct cuts: neck, shoulder, breast, rib, loin, and leg. Subsequently, employing the methodology outlined by Panea et al. [22], all cuts were meticulously dissected into lean, fat (subcutaneous and intermuscular fat), and bone components within a controlled room environment ranging from 15 to 20 °C.

2.4. Models and Statistical Analysis

A comprehensive descriptive statistical analysis was conducted, encompassing the determination of mean, standard deviation, range, as well as the coefficient of variation for carcass characteristics such as CCW and weight, and percentage of muscle, subcutaneous fat, intermuscular fat, total fat, and bone, along with all VIA measurements.

For predictive modeling, K-fold stepwise regression analyses were employed to predict muscle, subcutaneous fat, intermuscular fat, total carcass fat, and bone weights and percentages. These models utilized either CCW plus VIA measurements or solely VIA measurements as independent variables. The accuracy of these predictions was assessed through the K-fold coefficient of determination (K-fold-R2), while the precision of the prediction models was evaluated using the residual mean square error (RMSE). The value of 0.05 was used as p-value threshold. Furthermore, the overall predictive ability of the k-fold cross-validation models was gauged through the ratio of percent deviation (RPD), which is the ratio of the standard deviation of the reference values to the RMSE of the validation [23]. All statistical procedures were executed using JMP software version 17 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

3. Results

Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, range, and coefficient of variation) for cold carcass weight, weight, and percentage of tissues and VIA measurements obtained with lateral and dorsal views of the light lamb carcasses.

The average cold carcass weight recorded was 4.52 kg. When considering the amount of carcass tissues, greater variation was evident, with coefficients of variation ranging from 22.9% for bone, 29.2% for muscle, 38.9% for intermuscular fat, to 58.6% for subcutaneous fat. In terms of VIA measurements, area measurements exhibited the most significant variation, with relatively close coefficients of variation (CV) observed for both lateral and dorsal views (20.0% < CV < 25.4% and 18.0% < CV < 25.0%, respectively). Conversely, angle measurements displayed the least variation for both lateral and dorsal views (3.5% < CV < 6.1% and 3.1% < CV < 3.4%, respectively).

3.1. Prediction of Carcass Tissues Weight in the Carcass

The predictors, coefficients of determination (K-fold-R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) for the best models to estimate the weight of carcass tissues are presented in Table 2.

The stepwise regression analysis using CCW and VIA measurements showed that the best prediction equations explained most of the variation observed in the weight of all carcass tissues (0.83 < K-fold-R2 < 0.98). The highest accuracy was observed for muscle, using model 1 (based on dorsal + lateral view data), and the lowest was for subcutaneous fat, also using model 1. Regardless of using model 1, model 2 (based on dorsal view data), or model 3 (based on lateral view data), CCW was the first independent variable in the best models for all tissues, which always included at least one VIA measurement. The number of VIA measurements included in the best prediction equation for each tissue was quite similar for the three models, except in the case of muscle, with the best prediction equation (model 1) including eight VIA measurements as independent variables, while models 2 and 3 only included one VIA measurement. For each tissue, the accuracy of the estimates obtained with the three models was quite similar, although the precision of the estimates was consistently higher for model 1—the largest difference was observed for bone (K-fold-R2 = 0.95 and RMSE = 21.76 for model 1; K-fold-R2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 28.20 for model 2, Table 2). For each tissue, concerning VIA measurements, there was little correspondence between the independent variables included in model 1 and the independent variables included in models 2 and 3. In the case of muscle, there were several independent variables from the dorsal and lateral view, but none of the ones included in models 2 and 3 (DP3 and LA1, respectively). For subcutaneous fat and bone, the first independent variables in model 1 corresponded to the first independent variables of models 2 and 3, but for muscle and intermuscular fat that did not happen. In the case of muscle, the first independent variable included in model 3 (Lw6; Table 3) was not even included in model 1. Besides CCW, model 1 included only lateral view data for intermuscular fat, while bone included more dorsal view data than lateral view data, and muscle included a similar amount of dorsal and lateral view data. When CCW was not included in the stepwise regression analysis the best prediction equations still explained a very large amount of the variation observed in the weight of all carcass tissues (0.74 < K-fold-R2 < 0.98; Table 3), regardless of the model used. For each tissue, model 1 included one to three more independent variables than the next best model, which was always model 2. Model 1 showed consistent but just slightly higher accuracy (0.89 < K-fold-R2 < 0.98, against 0.86 < K-fold-R2 < 0.94, for model 2) and higher precision, the largest difference being observed for muscle (K-fold-R2 = 0.98 and RMSE = 56.64, for model 1; K-fold-R2 = 0.94 and RMSE = 84.22, for model 2).

As for the analysis including CCW, the muscle was the tissue most accurately estimated (0.89 < K-fold-R2 < 0.98). However, excluding CCW from the analysis, intermuscular fat estimates became the ones showing the lowest accuracy (0.82 < K-fold-R2 < 0.89) except in the case of model 3, with the subcutaneous fat estimates remaining the ones showing the lowest accuracy (K-fold-R2 = 0.74). For subcutaneous fat and bone, the first independent variables in model 1 corresponded to the first independent variables of models 2 and 3, but for muscle and intermuscular fat that did not happen. In the case of muscle, the first independent variable included in model 3 (Lw6; Table 3) was not even included in model 1. Across the different tissues, model 1 included more dorsal view data than lateral view data and more independent variables than models 2 and 3.

3.2. Prediction of Carcass Tissues Percentage in the Carcass

The predictors, coefficients of determination (K-fold-R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) for the best models to estimate the percentage of carcass tissues are presented in Table 4.

The models for the prediction of carcass tissue percentages explained a much smaller amount of the variation observed than the equivalent models for the prediction of carcass tissue weights, except in the case of model 1 for subcutaneous fat, which showed K-fold-R2 = 0.83 and 0.78, respectively, for subcutaneous fat weight and subcutaneous fat percentage (Table 2 and Table 4). Still, with the exception of model 2 for muscle and intermuscular fat, the best prediction equations showed moderate to high accuracy (0.41 < K-fold-R2 < 0.78; Table 4) in predicting the percentage of the different carcass tissues. The highest accuracy was observed for subcutaneous fat, using model 1 (based on dorsal + lateral view data), and the lowest was for muscle, using model 2 (K-fold-R2 = 0.16; Table 4). Although CCW was the first independent variable in some of the best prediction equations (model 3 for all tissues except muscle and model 1 for bone), it was not included in most of the best prediction equations (Table 4). The number of VIA measurements included in the best prediction equation for each tissue was particularly larger in the case of model 1 for subcutaneous fat, total fat, and bone, in the latter case including CCW as well, particularly in the case of muscle (K-fold-R2 = 0.45; RMSE = 1.77), subcutaneous fat (K-fold-R2 = 0.78; RMSE = 0.84), and bone (K-fold-R2 = 0.72; RMSE = 1.00). Concerning VIA measurements, the first independent variables of models 2 and 3 were included in model 1, except in the case of the equations for muscle and intermuscular fat, which did not include the first independent variables of model 2 and included mainly lateral view data as independent variables, unlike model 1 for each of the other tissues, which included mainly dorsal view data. (Table 4). For those tissues with the best prediction equations including CCW (intermuscular fat, subcutaneous fat), when CCW was removed from the stepwise analysis, the best prediction equations showed poor to moderate accuracy (0.37 < K-fold-R2 < 0.46).

4. Discussion

Concerning the prediction of carcass tissue weight or carcass tissue percentage, regardless of the methodology/technology applied, the literature consistently shows body weight or carcass weight as the strongest single predictor, the question being if prediction accuracy is significantly increased using such different methodologies/technologies. In line with this, the present study showed CCW as the first independent variable included in the best models for the prediction of carcass tissue weights. However, for carcass tissue percentages, with the exception of bone, when the stepwise analysis used CCW data, CCW was included only in the best models without dorsal VIA data. Such a finding agrees with Araújo et al. [24]. In fact, working with hair sheep lambs, castrated males, from commercial herds, finished in confinement and slaughter in a range of weight from 21 to 49 kg, Araújo et al. [24] showed better estimates of CCW using dorsal view data than lateral view data and related this to the fact that in the dorsal region it is possible to use measurements that represent a large part of the carcass, with large deposition of musculature and adipose tissue. Horgan et al. [25] had already studied the contribution of dorsal and lateral view data for the best prediction equations using castrated male lambs reared at grass, weaned at an average age of 12 weeks, and slaughtered when they reached a target live weight of 42 kg. They showed that in collecting dorsal and lateral view data, most of the data included in the best prediction equations were supplied by the dorsal plan and, using just dorsal or lateral view data in the multiple regression analysis, most carcass traits were better predicted in the former case. The present study showed the same trend for carcass tissue weights when CCW was not included in the analysis, with model 1 including more dorsal view data than lateral view data as independent variables and model 2 showing higher accuracy than model 3, for all carcass tissues. Not so much when CCW was included in the analysis, nor when carcass tissues were predicted as a percentage of CCW, suggesting that, when the effect of CCW is accounted for, either including CCW as an independent variable or expressing carcass tissues of a percentage of CCW, lateral view data provide more complementary information than dorsal view data. The little correspondence observed, in most cases, between the independent variables included in model 1 and the independent variables included in models 2 and 3, for each carcass tissue, strengthens the idea that the complementarity of the information given by each independent variable for the best prediction equation is more valuable than the individual information of each independent variable. It is not possible to make a direct comparison between the present study with previous studies using VIA data since different studies used different linear measurements, area measurements, or even color, and some refer to saleable meat, which included a variable amount of fat and, sometimes, bone [4,12]. Also, factors such as breed, weight at slaughter, and feeding background have a strong effect on carcass composition. Previous studies on assessment of lamb carcasses by video image analysis have been conducted with quite different experimental populations, such as Scottish Mule Χ Suffolk male castrated lambs reared at grass, weaned at an average age of 12 weeks and slaughtered when they reached a target live weight of 42 kg [25], rams, ewes, and wethers of either wool-type (Rambouillet, Targhee) or large-frame meat-type (Suffolk, Hampshire), with a carcass weight of 24.3–27.2 kg [26], lamb carcasses reflecting the extreme range of variation in carcass traits experienced in commercial facility with hot carcass weight (HCW) ≤ 29.48 kg (light-muscled carcasses), HCW = 29.94 kg to 34.02 (medium-muscled carcasses) and HCW ≥ 34.47 kg (heavy-muscled carcasses) [27] and CCW = 21.22 kg to 54.34 kg [28], mixed sex and breed types selected to cover as far as possible the full spectrum of lambs slaughtered in Australia, with HCW = 13.6 to 34.0 kg [29] and purebred ram and ewe lambs of the Icelandic breed, with HCW = 7.2 to 26.8 kg [30]. Still, the present results compare well with results from such previous studies that showed R2 = 0.95 for saleable meat weight [25], R2 = 0.99 for lean meat weight [5], R2 = 0.58 for fat weight [25], 0.16 < R2 < 0.71 for saleable meat yield ([25,26,27,31], 0.48 < R2 < 0.74 for fat yield ([25,27,28], R2 = 0.60 for boneless saleable meat yield [29] and 0.52 < R2 < 0.58 for lean meat wield [29,30], particularly given the fact that the carcass weight the animals now used (mean CCW = 4.5 kg) was much smaller than the carcass weight of the animals used in such studies. The largest number of VIA measurements used as independent variables in the best prediction equations now obtained (nine VIA measurements with model 1, for subcutaneous fat percentage, excluding CCW from the analysis) is well in the range of the number of VIA measurements in the prediction equations developed in the same studies, (six to eight VIA measurements in most cases). Although there was a clear trend for model 1 to show higher accuracy and precision across all carcass tissues, considering the possibility of implementation of a VIA system under commercial abattoir conditions, this has to be balanced with the fact that model 1 also includes more VIA measurements as independent variables and implies the acquisition of images from two view plans instead of just one as in the case of models 2 and 3. If a larger number of VIA measurements to be collected may not be a problem with an automated system and the software resources currently available, creating the conditions to collect dorsal and lateral view data without interfering with the high speed of a slaughter line may not be practical. According to Viscarra Rossel et al. [32] most of the best prediction equations obtained in the present study for carcass tissue weights can be qualified as having excellent predictive value, presenting RPD > 2.5. The exceptions were the equations obtained with model 3 for fat weights when CCW was not included in the stepwise analysis. Even so, the equations for intermuscular fat and total fat showed very good predictive value (2.0 < RPD < 2.5) and the equation for subcutaneous fat showed good predictive value (1.8 < RPD < 2.0). Although the best equations for the prediction of the percentage of carcass tissues explained a considerably lower amount of the variation observed than the best equations for the prediction of carcass tissue weights, only the ones for the prediction of muscle percentage and model 2 for prediction of intermuscular fat percentage showed poor predictive value (1.0 < RPD < 1.4). The best equation for the prediction of subcutaneous fat percentage based on model 1 even showed excellent predictive value (RPD = 2.5).

5. Conclusions

This study not only confirms results from previous studies showing that information extracted from images of lamb carcasses can be used to explain most of the variation observed in carcass composition but also suggests that the same applies to light lamb carcasses, providing an objective means in conjunction of CCW, to have a value-based payment system that leads to a fair payment to the producer, according to the preference of the consumers. VIA data obtained from dorsal and lateral views provided higher accuracy and precision estimates than dorsal or lateral view data across all carcass tissues. However, considering the possibility of implementing a VIA system under commercial abattoir conditions, the need to reduce to a minimum the interference with the production chain may justify the option for using dorsal or lateral view data only. This needs further analysis, as well as additional studies, to strengthen the present results on light lamb carcasses.
