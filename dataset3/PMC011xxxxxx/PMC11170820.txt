Following publication of the original article [1], the authors identified that the captions for Figure 3A and Figure 4A are incorrect.

For Figure 3A

The incorrect caption is: "Expression of NF-κB was measured by Western Blotting with antibodies specific for NF-κB, the cells were treated as demonstrated in Figure 1"

The correct caption is: "Expression of NF-κB was measured by Western Blotting with antibodies specific for NF-κB, the cells were the same as in Figure 1B."

For Figure 4A

The incorrect caption is: "Expression of IRF-3 was measured by Western Blotting with antibodies specific for IRF-3, and the cells were treated as demonstrated in Figure 1"

The correct caption is: "Expression of IRF-3 was measured by Western Blotting with antibodies specific for IRF-3, and the cells were the same as in Figure 1B."
