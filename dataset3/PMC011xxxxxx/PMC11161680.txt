The genus Ponyalis Fairmaire, 1899 is currently classified in the lycid tribe Lyponiini (Bocak and Bocakova 1990, 2008; Kazantsev 2002, 2005; Kusy et al. 2019), which includes one other genus, Lyponia Waterhouse, 1878. These two genera have been confused for a long time due to their morphological similarities (e. g., Gorham 1883; Kleine 1924; Pic 1926; Nakane 1961, 1969). It was not until Bocak (1999) conducted a cladistics analysis based on morphological data, where he identified Ponyalis as a subgenus of Lyponia. Later, Kazantsev (2002) reinstated Ponyalis as a separate genus because of its morphological differences from Lyponia, which are as follows: basal part of the coxite free, while basally fused in Lyponia; antennomere I abruptly widened near base in both sexes, while progressively widened towards apex in Lyponia; elytral primary costa III almost reaching apex, while not extending beyond apical fifth in Lyponia; aedeagus present with a pair of lateral thorns in the preapical portion of the median lobe, while absent in Lyponia (Kazantsev 2002). Kazantsev’s (2002) classification system was adopted by Li et al. (2015a) and supported by their molecular phylogenetic results of Lyponiini (Li et al. 2015b).

Prior to this study, a total of 18 Ponyalis species are described, which are widely distributed in the eastern Palaearctic and Oriental regions (Bocak 1999; Bocakova and Bocak 2007; Li et al. 2015a). During our study, we assembled a large series of Ponyalis material, which made it possible for us to review this genus. After examination and identification, we discovered six new species from China, which are reported in the present study. Meanwhile, some of the previously known species are illustrated in more detail to make them better known, and enable comparison with the new species, allowing a better understanding of the species diversity of the Chinese Ponyalis fauna.

﻿Materials and methods

The studied specimens are deposited in the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (IZAS), Entomological Museum of China Agricultural University, Beijing, China (CAU) and Museum of Hebei University, Baoding, China (MHBU).

Studied specimens were first softened in water, and then the genitalia of both sexes were dissected. After dissection, the male genitalia was cleared in a 10% NaOH solution, examined and photographed in glycerol, and finally glued on a paper card for permanent preservation. Images of the adults were taken with a Canon EOS 80D digital camera, and those of the genitalia by a Leica M205A stereomicroscope, which were stacked in Helicon Focus 7. The final plates were edited in Adobe Photoshop CS3.10.0.1.

The measurements were taken with Image J 1.50i (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Body length was measured from the anterior margin of the head to the elytral apex, and the width across the elytral humeri. Pronotal length was measured from the middle of the anterior margin to the middle of posterior margin of the pronotum and the width across its widest part. Eye diameter was measured at the maximal width and the interocular distance at the minimal point. The shapes of male antennomeres were assessed based on the ratio of the apical process to corresponding stem of the antennomere in length. We considered the antennomere as triangular if the ratio was at most 1.0, otherwise as lamellate if a higher value.

The distribution information was collected from the original publications (Bocak 1999; Kazantsev 2002; Li et al. 2015a) and the newly collected material. The distribution map was prepared by the ArcMap 10.8 and edited in Adobe Photoshop CS3.10.0.1.

Type material.

Holotype: ♂ (IZAS), China, Hainan, Jianfeng, 21.V.1980, leg. F. J. Pu. Paratype: 1♀ (IZAS), same data as the holotype.

Differential diagnosis.

This new species can be readily identified from all other Ponyalis by the combination of the following characters: pronotum uniformly black, elytra red (Fig. 12C, D); male antennomere I flattened dorsally, III and IV long-triangular, lamella of VI longer, 1.8× longer than joint itself (Fig. 12C); elytral primary costae much stouter than the secondary ones, cells transverse (Fig. 12C, D); phallus widened near middle and sinuate at lateral margins, projected distad and narrowly rounded at apical margin in dorsal and ventral views (Fig. 11G, H).

It looks like P.klapperichi in the general appearance, but can be distinguished from the latter by the following characters: male pronotum broad (0.7× longer than wider) (Fig. 12C), while slender in P.klapperichi (0.9–1.0× longer than wider) (Fig. 6A); lamella of antennomere VII 2.3× longer than joint itself (Fig. 12C), while 3.0× in P.klapperichi (Fig. 6A); phallus moderately projected distad at apical margin (Fig. 11G, H), while nearly straight in P.klapperichi (Fig. 5A, B).

Description.

Male (Fig. 12C). Body stout, black, pronotum dark-brown, elytra cinnabar red.

Head dorsally flat, antennae reaching elytral mid-length when inclined, antennomere I barely flattened dorsally, III–IV long-triangular, 1.3–1.5× as long as wide, lamellae of V–VII extended along whole length of corresponding stem and tapered laterally, 1.5–2.3× longer than the corresponding antennomere itself.

Pronotum trapezoidal, flat, and barely wider than long, with rounded anterior angles and rectangular posterior angles, anterior margin arched, lateral margins weakly sinuate and posterior margin bisinuate. Scutellum barely narrowed posteriorly and obviously emarginate at apex.

Elytra barely widened posteriorly, primary costae stouter than secondary ones, primary costae II, III and IV stouter than others in whole length of elytra, most cells rectangular.

Aedeagus: phallus stout, 2.1× as long as wide, abruptly widened at middle and sinuate at lateral margins, moderately projected distad at apical margin and narrowly rounded at apex in dorsal and ventral views, with acute latero-apical angels, between which the distance much smaller than maximal width of trunk (Fig. 11G, H), almost even in width and weakly bent dorsally, truncate at ventro-apical 1/4 in lateral view (Fig. 11I); internal sac membranous and expanded, densely covered with minute tubercles and short bristles on surface, abruptly thinned into a thorn-like apex (Fig. 11 G–I).

Female (Fig. 12D). Similar to male, but body stouter.

Distribution

(Fig. 1). China (Hainan).

﻿Discussion

As the number of species descriptions increases, we have a better understanding of the diversity of Ponyalis. With six species newly described, we raised the number of known species to 24. In general (Fig. 1), Ponyalis are mainly distributed in China (21 species, accounting for 87.5% of species diversity), and most of them are endemic, except for a few that are distributed to adjacent countries, including Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and India (3 species, 12.5%), and Korea (1 species, 4.1%), respectively. The remaining three species (12.5%) are restricted to Japan. This distribution pattern is similar to that of Lyponia (Fang et al. 2024). As noted by others (Nakane 1969; Bocak 1999), there is a high turnover of Lyponiini in species composition amongst mountain ranges in China and between continental Asia and adjacent islands (including Taiwan and Japan). The tribe was inferred to have originated from continental Asia, and the species in adjacent islands were established separately by multiple vicariance or short distance dispersal events (Li et al. 2015b; Masek et al. 2018). Meanwhile, most of the Ponyalis species are narrowly distributed (Fig. 1), and limited ranges also have often been documented in other net-winged beetles, which have been ascribed to their low dispersal propensity (e.g., Bocak and Yagi 2010; Malohlava and Bocak 2010; Sklenarova et al. 2013). The present result is congruent with the opinion of Li et al. (2015b) that allopatric speciation is proposed as the predominant mechanism of speciation of Ponyalis.

Furthermore, based on the examination and comparison results of more material, we have a better understanding of the morphology of Ponyalis. The internal sac of male genitalia is usually invaginated in the phallus and exposed only apically, making it difficult to be well prepared and retracted for examination. Luckily, we have almost seen the overall structure of internal sac of P.hainanensis sp. nov. Our examination shows that the internal sac (Fig. 11G–I) is membranous and densely covered with minute tubercles and short bristles on surface, and it is overall expanded, but abruptly thinned at apex. The apex is a slender or thorn-shaped tube, and either long and evidently exposed (e.g., Figs 3D–F, J–L, 5A–C, G–L) or short even hardly visible (e.g., Figs 3A–C, G–I, 5D–F, 9, 11). However, this is inconsistent with the opinion of Li et al. (2015a), who argued that the apical length of internal sac is a differential diagnosis between Ponyalis and Lyponia (Poniella) Kazantsev, 2002. These have nearly identical shapes of the aedeagus (Li et al. 2015a), but their separation was well supported by the molecular phylogenetic analysis (Li et al. 2015b), also by some morphological differences found in the antennae, elytral costae, and coxite (Kazantsev 2002). This suggests that we should consider and integrate the characters comprehensively, and not base taxonomic decisions on a single character.

Moreover, Li et al. (2015b) noted that the females do not have any diagnostic characters of either the genitalia or antennae, but we found that they are indeed present with some differences in the details of their antennal shapes (e.g., Figs 2B, D, 4B, C, 6B, 7B, D, 8B, 12B). Of course, this requires the material of both sexes available for us to recognize the species comprehensively. Within Ponyalis, although the appearance is sometimes variable, such as P.himalejica and P.laticornis, its antennal shape and aedeagus are relatively conserved and dependable, which are mainly applied in the following identification key to the species.
