pmcCorrection to: Nature Communications 10.1038/s41467-023-44544-w, published online 08 January 2024

The original version of this Article contained an error in Fig. 1l, in which the labelling of S9.6 and PSIP1 in the genome browser shot is inadvertently swapped. This has now been corrected both in the html and pdf version.
