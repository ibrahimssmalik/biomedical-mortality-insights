Abstract

Background

The genus Helius Lepeletier & Serville, 1828 is globally distributed with 232 species and subspecies, of which 25 have been known to occur in China. Amongst the Chinese Helius crane flies, 24 species are distributed in southern China. The species diversity of Helius in other Chinese regions may be severely underestimated due to a lack of investigation. Some investigations on crane flies in Inner Mongolia, China have been initiated by the authors together with other entomologists, with Helius being one of the key targets of attention.

New information

Two Helius species, H. (Helius) flavus (Walker, 1856) and H. (H.) gracillimus Alexander, 1938, are added to the Chinese fauna. The two newly-recorded species also represent the first records of the crane fly tribe Elephantomyiini in Inner Mongolia. Re-descriptions and illustrations of the two newly-recorded species are presented.

Helius Lepeletier & Serville, 1828 (Latreille et al. 1828) is a species-rich genus in the family Limoniidae consisting of extant 232 species and subspecies from nine subgenera around the world (Oosterbroek 2023). This genus and another limoniid genus Elephantomyia Osten Sacken, 1860 (Osten Sacken 1860), both with elongated rostrum, are often considered as a sister group (such as Ribeiro (2008), Petersen et al. (2010), Kang et al. (2023)). It is worth mentioning that there are many records of Elephantomyia feeding on flowers (such as Alexander (1924a), Savchenko (1983), Savchenko (1986), Zhang et al. (2015), Kato (2017)), but there seems to be no published record of Helius feeding on flowers or of feeding in any other way (Oosterbroek and Lukashevich 2021).

In the past three decades, a large number of taxonomic studies have been carried out on the genus Helius, mainly focusing on fossil species (such as Krzemiński (1991), Krzemiński (1993), Krzemiński (2002), Podenas (2002), Ribeiro (2003), Kania et al. (2013), Kania (2014), Krzemiński et al. (2014), Kania et al. (2016a), Kania et al. (2016b), Kopeć et al. (2016), Kania et al. (2018), Wu et al. (2019), Kania-Klosok et al. (2021)), with relatively few on extant species. Stubbs (1992) reported a Helius species new to Britain. Welch and Gelhaus (1994) published a new Helius species from Trinidad. Podenas and Byun (2014), Podenas et al. (2015) and Podenas et al. (2017) reported five newly-recorded species of Helius from the Korean Peninsula and provided their descriptions and illustrations. Quindroit (2022) provides biologies, geographical distribution data and illustrations of five Helius species from France. Xu et al. (2023) reported the genus Helius in Guangxi, China for the first time and published a new species and a newly-recorded subspecies from China.

According to Oosterbroek (2023), 25 Helius crane fly species have been recorded from China, of which 23 belong to the nominotypical subgenus and two belong to the subgenus Eurhamphidia Alexander, 1915 (Alexander 1915). In this study, we report two additional Helius species to the Chinese fauna, namely H. (Helius) flavus (Walker, 1856) and H. (H.) gracillimus Alexander, 1938, which also represent the first records of the crane fly tribe Elephantomyiini in Inner Mongolia, China. Re-descriptions and illustrations of the newly-recorded species are presented.

Materials and methods

The specimens of this study were collected by insect nets at different locations in Inner Mongolia, China (Fig. 1) and deposited in the Entomological Museum of Qingdao Agricultural University, Shandong, China (QAU). Genitalic preparations of males were made by boiling the hypopygium in lactic acid (C3H6O3) for half an hour. Details of body colouration were examined in specimens immersed in 75% ethanol (C2H5OH). Specimens were examined using a ZEISS Stemi 2000-C stereomicroscope. Photographs were captured by a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV digital camera.

The morphological terminology mainly follows Cumming and Wood (2017) and that for venation follows de Jong (2017). The following abbreviations in figures are used: aa = aedeagus apodeme; aed = aedeagus, cerc = cercus, goncx = gonocoxite, hyp vlv = hypogynial valve, i gonst = inner gonostylus, interb = interbase; o gonst = outer gonostylus, pm = paramere, st = sternite, tg = tergite.

Notes

Helius (H.) flavus is widely distributed in the Palaearctic Region (Oosterbroek 2023) and recorded in China for the first time. Walker (1856) first discovered this species and provided a brief description without figures and Starý (1966) illustrated the female ovipositor for the first time. Subsequently, Starý and Rozkośný (1970), Geiger (1986), Podenas et al. (2006), Podenas et al. (2017) and Quindroit (2022) successively illustrated this species, amongst which Podenas et al. (2017) provided detailed description and illustrations of the male for this species. The species is closely related to H. (H.) unicolor (Brunetti, 1912) in the key by Xu et al. (2023) and can be distinguished by the inner gonostylus with five teeth on the outer margin of the middle (Fig. 3A, B and E). In H. (H.) unicolor, the inner gonostylus has no teeth (Brunetti 1912).

Notes

Helius (H.) gracillimus is an East Palaearctic species that occurs in Russia, North Korea and South Korea (Oosterbroek 2023) and now recorded in China for the first time. For descriptions and illustrations of this species, also see Alexander (1938) and Podenas and Byun (2014). The species is closely related to H. (H.) subfasciatus Alexander, 1924 in the key by Xu et al. (2023) and can be distinguished by the brownish-yellow pleuron and the yellow coxae (Fig. 5A). In H. (H.) subfasciatus, the pleuron is dark brownish-black and the coxae is brown (Alexander 1924b).

Discussion

The two newly-recorded species for Chinese fauna are both from Inner Mongolia, a Chinese Province with very limited species records of Limoniidae. According to Oosterbroek (2023), only five limoniid crane flies are recorded in Inner Mongolia, of which four belong to the subfamily Chioneinae and only one belongs to the subfamily Limoniinae. With the discovery of these two Helius species in this study, the number of Limoniinae species in Inner Mongolia increases to three. They also represent a new recorded crane fly tribe (i.e. Elephantomyiini) in Inner Mongolia, which indicates that the species diversity of Limoniidae in Inner Mongolia may be severely underestimated. As for Chinese Helius crane flies, previously only one species was distributed in northern China (Jilin), while the remaining 24 species were all distributed in southern China (Oosterbroek 2023). The discovery of the two Helius species in Inner Mongolia provides valuable distribution records for geographical research of the genus and also indicates that there may be huge potential for species diversity of Helius in northern China.
