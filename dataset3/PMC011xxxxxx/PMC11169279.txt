Blockchain can be used to track pharmaceutical products at every step of the supply chain, from manufacturing to distribution, and ultimately to the end-user. Every transaction available in the supply chain process is stored in a tamper-proof and immutable ledger, enabling transparency and accountability. This tracking feature can help prevent losses due to theft, diversion, or counterfeiting, as any unauthorized changes or attempts to modify the data would be detected and flagged. Shipping of raw materials, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, involves multiple levels and personalities, and is vulnerable to various external factors such as theft or modification. Such events can result in significant losses and pose a threat to human life1. In the shipping process Blockchain can also help prevent loss and counterfeiting of pharmaceutical products by providing a secure and decentralized platform for authentication and verification. Each product can be assigned a unique digital identity, which can be verified by all stakeholders in the supply chain, including manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. This verification process ensures that only authentic products are sold to end-users, reducing the risk of loss and harm caused by counterfeit products2. Digital evidence plays a crucial role in investigating any illegal activities, especially in complex processes like shipping raw materials. The Shipping Chain of Raw Material (SCRM) is an effective system that maintains the integrity of pharmaceutical products by keeping all the information of interactions with different specification and their related work in online form. This system ensures the preservation of digital evidence throughout the entire lifecycle of the investigation. SCRM logs all the relevant information such as when and how digital evidence of events is recorded and preserved3. This transparency in recording and preserving digital evidence can be helpful in any kind of investigation where the integrity and originality of evidence are critical. Blockchain technology is an ideal solution for SCRM as it offers tamper-resistance, data integrity, and transparency, which are critical for recording the integrity of the raw materials throughout the shipping process. By using blockchain, all the records related to the shipping of raw materials can be securely stored in a decentralized database, which cannot be tampered with by any individual or entity4. In addition to maintaining the integrity of the raw materials during the shipping process, SCRM also plays a crucial role in digital investigations. By providing an unalterable digital record of all the events related to the shipping of raw materials, SCRM makes it easier to identify any illegal activities that may have occurred during the process5,6. So the use of SCRM powered by blockchain technology is essential in maintaining the integrity of raw materials during the shipping process and ensuring the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products. It also plays a crucial role in digital investigations by providing a transparent and unalterable digital record of all events related to the shipping process.

Finally the pharmaceutical product supply chain is plagued by various challenges, including counterfeiting, diversion, and theft, leading to significant financial losses and potential health risks for consumers. Motivated by the urgent need to enhance traceability, transparency, and security in this critical industry, the proposed blockchain framework with a proof-of-concept (PoC) in Hyperledger Composer aims to prevent losses by creating an immutable and decentralized ledger that tracks the movement of pharmaceutical products from manufacturing to distribution. This innovative solution harnesses blockchain technology to address the problem of product loss, bolstering the integrity of pharmaceutical supply chains and ultimately safeguarding public health.

The organization of this paper is as follows: Section “Literature review” illustrates the various research work performed in this field; Section “Materials and methods” demonstrates the materials and the methods; Section “Blockchain for pharmaceutical product supply chain” discusses the use of blockchain for the product supply chain required for this study; Section “Shipping process of raw material in SCM” provides the details of the shipping process of the materials; Section “Proposed model” provide simulations results and discussion; Finally, Section “Conclusion” concludes this study.

It provides developers with a range of tools and libraries to help them create and deploy blockchain applications rapidly. One of the key features of Hyperledger Composer is its ability to integrate data with blockchain applications. This is achieved by creating business networks that contain assets, stakeholders, and communications across multiple blockchain networks. These networks are then recorded in the Hyperledger Composer, which provides a centralized repository for all blockchain-related data29,31. Hyperledger Composer also provides a range of tools for managing transactions between different stakeholders, such as sellers, buyers and observers/viewers in the blockchain network. Once these parties have been registered in the blockchain, they can carry out transactions as per their roles and responsibilities. The Hyperledger Composer framework works in three layers, as mentioned in Fig. 4. The composer in the first layer is used to create a business-network definition, which includes the model, script, ACL (Access Control List), and query files. The model file defines the data model used in the application, the script file defines the transaction logic, the ACL file defines the permissions and access control rules, and the query file defines the queries that can be used to retrieve data from the ledger. The second layer it is packaged up into an archive file format that can be exported and deployed to any environment that supports the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network29,38. The final layer uses ID cards to deploy the business network definition to a distributed ledger. An ID card is essentially a digital identity that is used to authenticate and authorize users and applications to interact with the blockchain network. Once the ID card is created, it can be used to deploy the business network definition to the blockchain network. Overall, Hyperledger Composer provides a powerful and flexible framework for developing blockchain applications, with a range of tools and libraries to help developers create, manage, and deploy blockchain networks quickly and efficiently.Figure 4 Framework of Hyperledger Composer.

Core Modules manage functionalities, Blockchain Module handles blockchain operations, Distributed Transaction Store stores data securely, and Front End provides user interaction. Together, these components enable secure and transparent handling of assets, participants, and transactions in blockchain applications as shown in Fig. 5.Core Modules: These modules in SCRM are required for monitoring the communication and coordination among the nodes or participants in the network. These modules are typically designed to handle key functions such as transaction validation, block creation, and consensus mechanisms. Functional Flow diagram of SCRM Blockchain Technology is shown in Fig. 6

Blockchain Module: This module is used for creating new blocks in the blockchain. It collects valid transactions from the transaction processing module and adds them to a new block.

Distributed Transaction Store: This module is responsible for validating and processing transactions submitted by participants. It ensures that each transaction is valid and follows the rules of the blockchain network.

Front End: This interface allows the participants to perform various actions on the SCRM blockchain, such as creating new assets or participants, updating or deleting existing ones, and submitting transactions. The front end also provides real-time visibility into the state of the blockchain, allowing participants to monitor the progress of their transactions and view the current state of the system. Overall, the front end plays a crucial role in enabling seamless interaction between the participants and the SCRM blockchain. Figure 6 shows the Communication of participants with SCRM blockchain UI.

Proof-of-concepts

The SCRM (Supply Chain Risk Management) blockchain application can be implemented as a proof-of-concept (PoC) to demonstrate its feasibility and potential benefits. The PoC can involve a small-scale simulation of the supply chain process, using mock data and participants. The following steps can be taken to implement the PoC:Define the scope and objectives of the PoC, such as the specific supply chain process to be simulated, the expected benefits of using blockchain, and the key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success.

Design the blockchain architecture and smart contract code, using tools such as Hyperledger Composer or Solidity. Define the data structure for assets, participants, and transactions, and ensure that the smart contract enforces the desired business rules and conditions.

Implement the blockchain network and deploy the smart contract code on it. Set up the necessary nodes, such as orderers and peers, and configure the permissions and access controls.

Create the mock data and participants, including assets, such as raw materials, products, and documents, and participants, such as suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. Define their identities and roles in the supply chain process.

Conduct the simulation, using the mock data and participants, and record the transactions on the blockchain. Monitor the performance and accuracy of the system, and collect data on the KPIs.

Analyze the results and evaluate the success of the PoC. Assess the performance and scalability of the system, as well as the benefits and challenges of using blockchain for SCRM. Identify any improvements or modifications that may be needed for future implementation.

Present the PoC findings and recommendations to stakeholders, such as supply chain managers, regulators, and investors, and seek their feedback and support for further development and implementation.

By conducting a PoC for SCRM using blockchain, organizations can gain valuable insights into the potential benefits and challenges of using this technology for supply chain management. This can help them make informed decisions about whether to invest in blockchain, and how to design and deploy it effectively. The data structure is used to define a SCRM transaction model as shown below.

The SCRM model is implemented using the Hyperledger Composer blockchain development tool, which provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for creating and deploying blockchain-based applications40,41. The model has essential functionalities including creating, updating, deleting, and displaying transactions from the blockchain, and access to these functionalities is controlled by the permissions.acl file. Different class structures and script segments are used to define the data model and transaction logic for the SCRM blockchain are shown below.

Sample codes

The provided script segment describes a transaction represented in a class format. Here's the breakdown of its key components:$class: This field specifies the class type of the transaction, which is "org.example.basic.Transaction." It indicates the type or category of the transaction within the system or application.

ID: The "ID" field contains a unique identifier for the transaction, set to "0xBLOCKCHAIN_SCM." This identifier can be used to distinguish this specific transaction from others within the system.

creator: This field identifies the creator of the transaction. It is set to "resource:org.example.basic.Participants#9976," indicating that the participant with the ID "9976" is the one who initiated or created the transaction.

owner: The "owner" field specifies the owner of the transaction. In this case, it is also set to "resource:org.example.basic.Participants#9976," indicating that the same participant (ID: 9976) currently owns the transaction.

Description: This field provides a brief description or necessary information about the transaction. The description is "Necessary information describing the transaction," which can include details about the purpose, content, or nature of the transaction.

transferChain: The "transferChain" field is an array that lists participants involved in the transaction. In this example, it contains a single entry, "resource:org.example.basic.Participants#9976," indicating that the participant with ID 9976 is part of this transaction.

timeChain: The "timeChain" field is another array that records timestamps related to the transaction. It includes a single timestamp, "2023–07-08T15:03:756Z," which represents the date and time when the transaction occurred.

The provided script segment represents a participant class in a blockchain data structure. Here's the meaning of the fields in this class:"$class": This field specifies the class or type of the asset, which is "org.example.basic.Participants" in this case, indicating the class to which this participant belongs.

"ParticipantID": This is a unique identifier for the participant, which is set to "9876" in this instance. It is used to uniquely identify this participant within the blockchain network.

"firstName": This field holds the first name of the participant, which is set to "XYX" in this example.

"lastName": This field contains the last name of the participant, which is set to "PQR" in this case.

The provided script segment appears to describe a "Transaction Transfer" class in a blockchain-based system. Here's an explanation of the key elements:$class: This field specifies the class of the transaction, indicating that it belongs to the "org.example.basic.TransactionTransfer" class.

ID: This field represents the unique identifier for the transaction transfer and is linked to a specific transaction. It uses a resource reference to point to a particular transaction, identified by its ID, which is "0xPQRSTUVWXYZ" in this case.

newOwner: It identifies the new owner of the transaction. This field uses a resource reference to link to a participant or user in the system, identified as "org.example.basic.Participants#6799."

transactionID: This field contains a unique identifier for the transaction transfer itself. The identifier "34c3456-c356-8634-b7d7-c78b56a56d98" is used to distinguish this specific transfer from others.

Timestamp: This field indicates the date and time when the transaction transfer occurred. In this case, it occurred on "2023–07-08" at "15:12:755" (in UTC time zone).

The provided script segment describes the state of a "Transaction" after several transfers between participants in a blockchain-based system. Here's an explanation of the key elements:$class: This field specifies the class of the transaction, indicating that it belongs to the "org.example.basic.Transaction" class.

ID: This field represents a unique identifier for the transaction. In this case, the ID is "0xPQRSTUVWXYZ."

creator: It indicates the participant who initially created the transaction. The "creator" is linked to a specific participant identified as "org.example.basic.Participants#9976."

owner: It represents the current owner of the transaction. The "owner" is also linked to a specific participant, again identified as "org.example.basic.Participants#9976." It appears that the owner hasn't changed in this instance.

Description: This field contains a description or necessary information describing the transaction, providing context or details about the transaction's purpose or content.

transferChain: This is an array that represents a chain of participants involved in transferring ownership of the transaction. It shows the historical sequence of participants who have had ownership of the transaction. The array includes references to participants such as "org.example.basic.Participants#9976," "org.example.basic.Participants#8799," "org.example.basic.Participants#7998," and "org.example.basic.Participants#6887."

timeChain: This array corresponds to the timestamps for each transfer of ownership within the "transferChain." It indicates when each transfer occurred. The timestamps are provided in the "2023–07-08" date format, along with the time in UTC, for example, "15:12:852z."

So this script segment represents the state of a blockchain transaction, tracking its history of ownership transfers among participants, along with associated timestamps, and provides a description of the transaction. It offers a transparent and immutable record of the transaction's lifecycle within the blockchain system.

This consortium governs the controlled environment where a permissioned SCRM blockchain is constructed using Hyperledger Composer. Framework for Hyperledger Fabric VI performance evaluation is shown in Fig. 7.Figure 7 Hyperledger Framework for Fabric VI performance evaluation14.

Performance evaluation

Due to the unique properties of blockchain technology, traditional performance metrics may not be directly applicable. In a blockchain network, there is no central authority to validate transactions, and instead, each transaction is replicated across multiple nodes belonging to different organizations. Instead of processing individual transactions, blockchain networks typically process blocks of transactions that are committed after a consensus process involving all nodes on the network18,19. This consensus process ensures that all nodes on the network agree on the current state of the blockchain, which helps to maintain the integrity and security of the system. the consensus process is dependent on factors such as the input traffic and the hardware performance of the blockchain miner, it can be difficult to predict the exact time it will take for a transaction to be committed. However, by monitoring performance metrics such as the number of transactions in the queue, the block size, and the overall throughput of the network, it is possible to gain insight into the performance and scalability of the blockchain20,22.

Experimental setup

The REST interface is used to interact with the blockchain network through HTTP requests, which enables easy integration of client applications with the blockchain network. The test harness is used to simulate the real-world scenarios and measure the performance of SCRM blockchain under different workloads and network conditions. The Hyperledger Fabric VI blockchain is used because it provides a high-performance, scalable, and secure platform for developing and deploying blockchain applications. It is an open-source, permissioned blockchain platform that allows organizations to build and deploy their own blockchain networks with fine-grained access control and confidentiality. Performance parameter of the blockchain is given as below22.

Transaction latency

Transaction latency is the time it takes for a blockchain network to commit a transaction after it has been submitted. In other words, it is the time period between when a transaction is submitted to the blockchain network and when it is successfully added to the blockchain ledger. Average transaction latency in a blockchain network are committed in blocks after reaching consensus, it can be challenging to determine the transaction latency for individual transactions. Therefore, the average transaction latency is calculated by taking the sum of all transaction latencies and dividing it by the total number of committed transactions. This provides an estimate of the average time it takes for transactions to be added to the blockchain ledger and it is defined as belowAverageTransactionLatency=∑TransactionLatency/TotalcommittedTransactions

Transaction throughput

Transaction throughput is the rate at which valid transactions are committed to the blockchain network over a defined time interval. It represents the number of transactions that the blockchain network can process in a given period of time22 and it is give as below-Transactionthroughput=TotalCommittedTransactions/TotalTime@percentageofcommittedtransactions

Scalability

Scalability is a measure of how well a blockchain system can maintain low transaction latency even with an increased number of workloads. This is an important consideration for blockchain systems, as increased workloads can lead to increased transaction processing times and lower system performance. By designing systems that can scale to accommodate higher workloads, blockchain developers can ensure that their systems remain performant and responsive even as demand grows23.

In the pharmaceutical supply chain logistics, many organizations may be involved in transporting raw materials, and multiple participants from these organizations may submit transactions to the SCRM blockchain. These transactions then undergo a consensus process to ensure that they are valid and correct. Once the consensus process is completed, the transactions are assigned a state, which can either be committed or failed is depicted in Fig. 8.Figure 8 Pictorial Representation of Performance Metric.

The research conducted to test the performance of SCRM used four different scenarios, each with varying numbers of organizations and clients, and a total of 10 test runs for each scenario. The tests were conducted on a system running Ubuntu 16.04, with an Intel Core i5-7400 CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and multiple fabric networks were used to measure the performance of the SCRM blockchain. By conducting these tests on multiple fabric networks and with varying numbers of organizations and clients, the researchers were able to assess the performance and scalability of the SCRM blockchain under a range of different conditions. This information can be used to inform decisions about the deployment of SCRM in real-world settings, and to identify areas where further optimization or development may be necessary22. Tables 2 and 3 represents the different network involved and the values achieved for average latency and throughput for the all four scenarios. Table 2 Types of Network involved.

It appears that the nature of the SCRM is undulate with respect to throughput, as increasing the block size results in an increase in throughput for the same type of network across different scenarios. The used pattern seems to hold true for different types of networks as well. Therefore, it appears that the SCRM is able to maintain consistent performance with respect to throughput regardless of the network conditions as depicted by Fig. 9.Figure 9 Throughput for our all four scenarios.

As depicted in Fig. 10 it shows that for block sizes ranging from 5 to 25, the SCRM is able to support scalability effectively. Specifically, for a block size of 5, 1.8 ms is the minimum average latency and 51.77 ms is the maximum average latency. Additionally, the throughput range is from 4 to 9 transactions for all four scenarios. Similarly, similar patterns are observed for other block sizes ranging from 10 to 25. These results suggest that the SCRM is able to maintain consistent performance and scalability across a range of block sizes22Figure 10 Scaling effects for different block sizes.

The nature of the SCRM is undulate with respect to average latency, regardless of the type of network being used. Specifically, increasing the block size results in an increase in average latency across all network types. However, the behaviour of the SCRM remains consistent and does not fluctuate. This suggests that the SCRM is robust and reliable, as it is able to maintain consistent performance despite changes in network conditions and this is depicted by Fig. 11.Figure 11 Average latency for our four scenarios.

The proposed Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) solution using blockchain technology offers significant advantages over traditional solutions like relational databases, particularly in the context of pharmaceutical product supply chains. Blockchain's transparency, security, and scalability aspects make it a compelling choice for enhancing the integrity and efficiency of supply chain logistics in the pharmaceutical industry. Blockchain's transparency is a key advantage. In a relational database system, transaction details are typically not visible to all users, leading to potential discrepancies and lack of trust. In contrast, blockchain ensures transparency by making all transactions visible and immutable across all nodes of the network. This transparency boosts accountability and trust among stakeholders, reducing the risk of fraudulent activities and counterfeit drugs infiltrating the supply chain. Also blockchain's security features are robust compared to relational databases. Relational databases are susceptible to security breaches like SQL injection attacks, which can compromise data integrity and confidentiality. On the other hand, blockchain's decentralized and cryptographic nature makes it highly resistant to unauthorized tampering or data manipulation. The use of cryptographic keys enhances security by ensuring that transactions are validated and recorded securely, minimizing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Hence blockchain's scalability is a significant advantage for pharmaceutical supply chains. Traditional databases often face limitations in scalability due to the exhaustive search space and performance issues beyond certain thresholds. In contrast, blockchain can scale efficiently by extending its network without inherent limitations, accommodating the growing complexity and volume of data in pharmaceutical supply chain operations. The implementation of a blockchain framework, such as the proof of concept (PoC) in Hyperledger Composer, offers tangible benefits in real-life engineering settings. It establishes a transparent and immutable ledger for pharmaceutical product data, enhancing traceability, visibility, and accountability throughout the supply chain. Real-time tracking capabilities enable swift response to quality issues, contamination, or recalls, minimizing financial losses and protecting public health. Additionally, blockchain's decentralized nature reduces reliance on a single authority, fostering trust, compliance, and security across the supply chain ecosystem. Overall, the adoption of blockchain in pharmaceutical product supply chains holds immense potential for optimizing operations, mitigating risks, and ensuring the delivery of safe and authentic medicines to consumers.

The research on implementing a proof-of-concept (PoC) for Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) through blockchain technology demonstrates a rigorous approach to assessing feasibility, scalability, and performance. By engaging stakeholders, conducting comprehensive tests across various scenarios, and gathering feedback, the study ensures the validity and reliability of the blockchain-based SCRM system. It provides valuable insights and a roadmap for improving security, efficiency, and transparency in pharmaceutical supply chains.

Conclusion

The implementation of blockchain technology in pharmaceutical supply chain logistics is a transformative step in reducing the risks associated with loss due to theft, counterfeiting, and diversion. Blockchain's transparent and secure framework instills trust and collaboration among supply chain partners, yielding substantial benefits for businesses and consumers alike. The proposed Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) blockchain application, designed for the secure shipping of pharmaceutical raw materials, has proven effective in providing a tamper-proof and auditable trail of all activities by various participants, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and transporters. This robust transparency and trust-building measure are instrumental in ensuring the smooth functioning of the pharmaceutical supply chain. And also the performance evaluation of the SCRM using the Hyperledger Caliper tool demonstrates its scalability, showcasing acceptable latency and throughput even under high transaction volumes. This resilience positions it as a viable solution for automating the raw material shipping industry in the future. With its capacity to handle substantial transaction volumes while maintaining high performance and security, the SCRM blockchain application holds the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical raw material shipping sector. It stands as a secure, transparent, and integrated platform for all stakeholders, promising to reduce fraud, enhance efficiency, and elevate the overall quality of the supply chain process.

While this research has unveiled the promising potential of blockchain in pharmaceutical supply chain logistics, it's crucial to acknowledge its limitations. Firstly, the research primarily focuses on raw material shipping, and the findings might not be directly transferable to other segments of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Secondly, real-world implementation challenges, such as regulatory compliance and technology adoption, were not deeply explored in this research. Additionally, the evaluation of the SCRM application's performance, while encouraging, was conducted in a controlled environment and may encounter unforeseen challenges during widespread implementation. So To build on these findings and address the research limitations, future studies should explore the application of blockchain technology across various aspects of pharmaceutical supply chain logistics. Investigating real-world implementation challenges and regulatory compliance issues is essential to gauge the feasibility of scaling up this technology. Additionally, research into the human factors and organizational dynamics impacting the adoption of blockchain in the pharmaceutical supply chain could provide valuable insights.
