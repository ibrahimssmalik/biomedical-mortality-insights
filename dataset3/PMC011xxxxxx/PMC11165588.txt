A one-pot procedure for the oxidative amidation of aldehydes via the in situ generation of reactive nitrile imine (NI) intermediates has been developed. Distinct from our progenitor processes, mechanistic and control experiments revealed that the NI undergoes rapid oxidation to an acyl diazene species, which then facilitates N-acylation of an amine. A range of substrates have been explored, including application in the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

The efficient and selective formation of amide bonds is a key deliverable in organic synthesis as this ubiquitous functional group comprises the backbone of peptides, proteins, and a range of other important biomolecules.1 The amide motif is prevalent across biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant small molecules, and accordingly, amidation processes account for a significant proportion (25%) of all reactions carried out in a drug discovery setting.2 The importance of the amide bond has directed considerable efforts toward the development of novel and efficient amidation methodologies, which has led to the creation of a large body of coupling chemistries.3

The mainstay of amide coupling methods involves the reaction of amines with electrophilic carboxylic acid derivatives, activated via the addition of stoichiometric quantities of activating or coupling reagents.4 While this method is very effective and highly utilized, some limitations remain, particularly regarding recent safety concerns associated with the use of coupling reagents.5 Accordingly, in an effort to avoid the use of toxic, sensitizing, and atom-inefficient coupling reagents, efforts have been made toward enabling the direct coupling of aldehydes with an appropriate amine source to yield amides in a formal oxidative process (Scheme 1a).6 This transformation typically relies on the in situ activation/oxidation of the aldehyde partner via conversion into an electrophilic acylating agent such as an NHC adduct,7 acyl halide,8 acyl-imide,9 or active ester.10

Scheme 1 Relevant Antecedence and Proposed Study

Alternatively, it has been reported that unactivated aldehydes can be directly employed with unactivated amines (or preactivated chloroamines) in amidation reactions mediated by transition metal catalysis,11 photoredox catalysis,12 or electrocatalysis.13 A range of metal-free aldehyde oxidative amidation processes have also been developed utilizing reagents such as hypervalent iodine species, hydrogen peroxide, or oxoammonium salts.14 Recently, our laboratories have shown how hydrazonyl bromides and N-aryl-substituted tetrazoles bearing an ortho-nitrophenyl ring may serve as latent active esters (LAEs)15 via an underexploited nitrile imine (NI) rearrangement reported independently by both Huisgen and Gibson (Scheme 1b).16 We leveraged this transformation for the facile synthesis of amide bonds and explored the orthogonality of this process to enable the N-acylation of proteinogenic amino acids and peptides.

While hydrazonyl halides and tetrazoles are frequently employed as efficient NI precursors, there is a paucity of methods for the generation of NIs directly from aldehyde-derived hydrazones. In this regard, a recent disclosure by Song and Tong demonstrated how the oxidative bromination of hydrazones via the combination of potassium bromide, Oxone, and potassium carbonate resulted in the formation of NIs which were then employed in a [3 + 2] cycloaddition with various dipolarophiles in a one-pot procedure.17 Inspired by this work, we reasoned that aldehydes, when combined with an inexpensive 2-nitrophenylhydrazine auxiliary, could be converted directly into amides by exploiting this oxidative protocol. At the outset of the current study, it was proposed that the treatment of 2-nitrophenyl-substituted hydrazone with KBr/Oxone/K2CO3 would trigger a 1,7-electrocyclization between the nascent NI and ancillary ortho-nitro group resulting in the in situ formation of an HOBt-type active ester which could be trapped with amines to provide the desired amides. Herein, we report the development of a one-pot method for the direct oxidative amidation of aldehydes and show how our investigations revealed that this amidation method is in fact mechanistically distinct from our original design hypothesis based on the progenitor processes (Scheme 1c).

Results and Discussion

The study commenced with the investigation of the one-pot amidation of 4-methylbenzaldehyde (1) using 2-nitrophenylhydrazine as an auxiliary and benzylamine as the nucleophile (Table 1). Initially, the conditions of Song and Tong were applied using KBr, Oxone, and K2CO3 in acetonitrile (Table 1, entry 1). Following full conversion to the hydrazone, the in situ oxidation to form the hydrazonyl bromide and subsequent hydrodehalogenation were investigated. The reaction was found to be highly sensitive to the nature of the solvent, with no conversion from the hydrazone to the amide 2a observed when using acetonitrile, toluene, dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran (Table 1, entries 1–4). This was attributed to the limited solubility of KBr, Oxone, and K2CO3 in these systems. When using a mixture of acetonitrile and water (9:1), traces of desired amide 2a (<5% NMR yield) were observed (entry 5). While the use of acetonitrile/H2O helped improve upon these solubility issues, the presence of water in large quantities was found to result largely in the decomposition of the highly reactive nitrile imine intermediate. The use of 1,4-dioxane and CHCl3 resulted in a marginal improvement in the yield, with amide 2a formed in 10 and 13%, respectively (entries 6 and 7). DMF was found to be an effective solvent in this process, albeit in a low NMR yield (entry 8).

Encouraged by this result, a screen was then carried out to determine the optimal base for this transformation. Performing the reaction with K3PO4 and Cs2CO3 (entries 9 and 10) resulted in comparable assay yields to K2CO3; however, the use of Li2CO3 led to a diminished NMR yield of amide 2a (entry 11). Potassium tert-butoxide was an effective base in this process, with a solution yield of 2a of 28%, while lithium hydroxide gave 2a in 18% yield (entries 12 and 13). Organic bases were found to perform poorly in this process with the use of DBU providing 2a in only 8% yield, while Et3N gave 2a in 9% yield (entries 14 and 15).

We next undertook a design of experiments (DoE) study as an expedient means of optimizing this aldehyde amidation process (Scheme 2).18,19 Accordingly, a two-level factorial, five-factor, half-fractional design was utilized assessing the effect of KBr stoichiometry (1.2–3 equiv), base stoichiometry (2–4 equiv), concentration (0.05–0.18 M), temperature (30–60 °C), and reaction time (1–3 h).

Scheme 2 Design of Experiments Optimization Study

Generally, the quantity of base was found to have a profound effect on the reaction as evidenced by the half-normal plot (Figure 1a), with increased stoichiometry significantly improving the reaction outcome. Additionally, the experiments revealed interesting two-dimensional relationships. For example, higher conversion was favored when increasing the stoichiometry of the base in combination with increased equivalents of KBr (Figure 1b), and increasing the concentration and stoichiometry of the base also resulted in elevated conversions (Figure 1c). For factors such as temperature (C) and concentration (E), there was negligible interaction observed (Figure 1d), although the half-normal plot initially suggested this as having a bearing on reaction outcome. The optimized conditions were 2 equiv of KBr, 5 equiv of K2CO3 at a concentration of 0.18 M at 50 °C for 1 h which afforded amide 2a in 81% NMR yield which was then isolated in 61% yield. The discrepancy observed relates to more protracted purification required to separate the amide product from a hydrolysis byproduct of the reaction (vide infra).

(b) 3-D response surface outlining the dependence of KBr and base stoichiometry on reaction conversion. (c) 3-D response surface highlighting relationship between concentration and base stoichiometry. (d) 3-D response surface showing more limited interaction between concentration and temperature.

To further enhance the conversion and tune the reactivity of the hydrazone species, the functionality of the 2-nitrophenyl aryl ring was also examined. Hydrazone compounds 1a–1e were subjected to the optimized amidation reaction conditions and the yield of amide 2a was determined (Scheme 3). Amide 2a was isolated in 58% yield when 2-nitrophenylhydrazone 1a was employed while 4-bromo-2-nitrophenylsubstituted hydrazone 1c gave amide 2a in 39% NMR yield. With 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (1b) and pyridine derivative (1d), formation of the desired amide 2a was observed in very low yield (<10%) likely due to the poor solubility of these substrates. A negative control experiment was next performed with hydrazone substrate 1e, without the crucial ortho-nitro functionality needed to facilitate the electrocyclization/cycloreversal which furnishes the active ester (cf.Scheme 1b). Surprisingly, this resulted in the formation of amide 2a in 33% isolated yield. This finding implied that the emerging process is mechanistically distinct to our progenitor systems, and is not proceeding through an HOBt-type active ester via the anticipated ortho-nitrophenyl NI rearrangement.

Scheme 3 Variation of N-Aryl Ring and Removal of ortho-Nitro Substituent

Yield determined via 1H NMR spectroscopy with reference to 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard.

Isolated yields unless otherwise stated.

Based on the above, we then sought to further investigate the mechanism of this KBr/Oxone-mediated amidation process (Scheme 4). First, the reaction was attempted without the addition of benzylamine; however, no active ester formation was observed. Instead, acyl diazene 3 was isolated from the reaction mixture in 28% yield which was fully characterized by 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Under these strongly oxidative conditions, bromination of the 4-position of the 2-nitrophenyl ring (3a) was also observed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Isolation of Reactive Intermediate 3 and LC–MS Profile of Reaction Mixture

Acyl diazene 3 was next reacted with benzylamine in DMF at 50 °C which afforded the desired amide 2a in 68% isolated yield, providing further evidence that 3 is an intermediate in this process (Scheme 5). To investigate the role of hydrazide 4 as an intermediate in the process, it was independently prepared and then subjected to the oxidative conditions with KBr/Oxone which afforded amide 2a in 71% yield. Previous protocols have been reported that involve the oxidative coupling of acyl hydrazides with amines.20 It was reasoned that the NI was rapidly hydrolyzed to provide a hydrazide intermediate 4 which was oxidized to diazene intermediate 3in situ. In our manifold, acyl diazene 3 is a reactive acylating agent and reacts with the requisite amine to form the amide products, with loss of nitrogen and concomitant formation of nitrobenzene as a byproduct which was detected by LC analysis (Scheme 5), and confirmed via gas chromatography–MS (GC–MS).

Scheme 5 Delineation of Role of Reactive Intermediates and LC–MS Reaction Profile

To probe the possibility of NI hydrolysis with adventitious water, the reaction mixture was doped with H218O; however, minimal 18O incorporation was observed (Scheme 6). Furthermore, there is no decrease in efficiency when the reaction is performed using anhydrous solvent. However, degassing the reaction solvent with nitrogen results in a slight decrease in observed NMR yield, suggesting that molecular oxygen and Oxone are responsible for the oxidation of the NI species. In general, the HPLC profiles of the reactions shown above are representative of the process, with the desired product being obtained in reaction times between 2 and 16 h

Scheme 6 Exploration of Nitrile Imine Hydrolysis

Yield determined via 1H NMR spectroscopy with reference to 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard.

On the basis of these control experiments, a reaction mechanism is proposed in Scheme 7. After condensation of the aldehyde and hydrazine, the resulting hydrazone is converted to the highly reactive NI intermediate via KBr/Oxone-mediated bromination and subsequent hydrodehalogenation in the presence of potassium carbonate. Before the NI 1,3-dipole can engage in a 1,7-electrocyclization with the ortho-nitro motif to form an HOBt-type active ester, under the strongly oxidizing conditions of the reaction that differ from our progenitor processes which utilized only base promotion,15 the acyl diazene 3 is formed, likely through the intermediacy of a hydrazide species 4. This mechanistic proposal is similar to that described previously by Müller and Waldmann, where activated acyl diazene intermediates are generated via enzyme-mediated oxidative cleavage of phenyl hydrazides with mushroom tyrosinase under an oxygen atmosphere before hydrolysis to provide carboxylic acids.21

Scheme 7 Proposed Mechanism

With the optimized conditions in hand and a more complete understanding of the reaction mechanism, the scope of transformation was explored for the preparation of a range of amides (Scheme 8). Under these conditions, the amidation of 4-methylbenzaldehyde (1) with benzylamine was achieved in 61% yield, which was increased slightly to 65% yield of 2a on a 1 mmol scale. Next, a range of primary benzylamine derivatives were coupled with 4-methylbenzaldehyde which afforded amides 2b and 2c in moderate yields (41 and 54%, respectively). Furthermore, a benzylamine derivative bearing an unprotected carboxylic acid functional group was applied under these conditions and afforded amide 2d in 24% yield. For substrates 2e and 2f, lower yields (25 and 18%) were noted when using sterically hindered amines as a slower coupling reaction resulting in competitive hydrolysis of the acyl diazene intermediate. In general, and as intimated previously, where lower yields were observed with the process, the carboxylic acid resulting from hydrolysis of the incipient acyl diazene usually accounted for the mass balance. Using this one-pot, multistep approach, a range of primary amines underwent N-acylation to provide amides 2g–2l, in moderate yields (31–57%). Cyclopropylamine and cyclohexylamine were coupled with 4-methylbenzaldehyde under these strongly oxidative conditions which provided amides 2m and 2n in 36 and 43% yields, respectively.

Scheme 8 Exploration of Amine and Aldehyde Substrates

Reaction performed on a 1.0 mmol scale.

Amidation was performed starting from the hydrazone.

Reactions were performed on a 0.5 mmol scale and isolated yields are reported.

Next, more sterically hindered cyclic secondary amines were applied in the one-pot procedure. While pyrrolidine was an effective nucleophile and gave 2o in 52% yield, morpholine was less efficient in this process and 2p was isolated in 32% yield. Despite an extended reaction time for the amine N-acylation step (>16 h), the competing formation of 4-methylphenylcarboxylic acid had a negative effect on the isolated yield of amide 2p.

With benzylamine as the N-nucleophile, the scope of the aldehyde component was next examined. With a methyl substituent in the ortho-position, amide 2q was isolated in 42% yield while para-isopropyl analogue was isolated in 52% yield. Aldehydes featuring electron-withdrawing groups in the para-position gave the corresponding amides 2s–2u in 41–58% yield. In relation to the nitrobenzene-derived substrate 2u, the yield obtained (40%) compares very favorably with our progenitor process which used a 2,5-diaryl tetrazole precursor to furnish the amide product in 39% isolated yield.15 Substrates bearing electron-donating groups were generally less efficient under the strongly oxidative conditions; however, mono- and dimethoxy analogues 2v and 2w were isolated in 41 and 25%, respectively. In relation to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes such as cinnamaldehyde, these were not productive substrates with <10% isolated yield obtained when using benzylamine as a nucleophile. Aliphatic aldehydes were applied under these one-pot reaction conditions and gave amides 2x, 2y, and 2z in comparatively lower yield (22–29%). In the case of pivaldehyde, the corresponding hydrazone could be prepared and subjected to the oxidative amidation conditions in a two-step process improving the yield of 2z to 39%, which is then directly more aligned with the yield obtained (63%) in our earlier reaction manifold using the more elaborate tetrazole-derived precursors as input, therefore, has the benefit of using a simple aldehyde as a starting material.15 Procainamide (6), a class Ia sodium channel blocker used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias,22 was synthesized using our methodology. In a one-pot process, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde was converted to the corresponding hydrazone and, upon treatment with KBr, Oxone, and K2CO3, the acyl diazene was formed in situ. The intermediate acyl diazene was then treated with N,N-diethylethylenediamine which gave amide 5 in 47%. Subsequent reduction of the nitro functionality afforded procainamide (6) in 77% yield. The yield associated with the amidation step compares favorably with our earlier reported synthesis15a of intermediate 5 which utilized a preformed diaryl tetrazole precursor to furnish the amide in 65% yield, whereas the current study employs the more readily available benzaldehyde derivative as a feedstock.

Conclusions

In summary, we have developed a one-pot procedure that consists of five distinct steps for the synthesis of amide bonds directly from the requisite aldehyde in a formal oxidative process using readily available reagents. This involves the condensation of a simple 2-nitrophenyl-substituted hydrazine with an aldehyde, followed by KBr-Oxone-mediated bromination of the hydrazone intermediate. In contrast to our previous studies utilizing N-(2-nitrophenyl)-hydrazonyl bromides and tetrazoles as NI precursors, this process does not proceed via the anticipated formation of an HOBt-type active ester instead proceeding via a distinct reaction pathway. Upon the generation of the NI dipole under these strongly oxidative conditions, our observations suggest the formation of an acyl diazene species, which then serves as an activated N-acylating agent, allowing the synthesis of a small library of amide products and known drug procainamide (6).
