==== Body
pmcThe Editorial Office was made aware of an error in Figure S1 within the original publication [1]. In addition to the corrected figure, the authors have provided raw data that were presented to an Academic Editor for evaluation. The original figure will now be replaced. The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated.

Figure S1 IR Spectra of CaCO3 produced with different whey treatments. (a) IR spectra fingerprint showing the characteristic bands of vaterite (V) and calcite (C) (b) IR spectra in the region of 2000–600 cm−1 where the presence of protein residues can be evidenced by the amide bands; C=O stretching mode of the amide functional group (1600–1700 cm−1), and N–H bending and C–N stretching vibrations (1500–1600 cm−1).
