Stenohya Beier, 1967, originally placed in the family Hyidae (Beier 1967), was erected with the type species S.vietnamensis Beier, 1967 and transferred to the family Neobisiidae by Harvey (1991), based on the presence of venom apparatus only in the fixed chelal finger and the presence of a non-lanceolate trichobothrium t. Of the 23 Stenohya species known, 14 of them occur in China (WPC 2022; Li and Shi 2023). These 14 species mainly occur in the southern region of China, except for S.xiningensis, which is lives in the northern region. Stenohya mainly lives in leaf litter and soil, under rocks, bark, and fern fronds.

Sexual dimorphism is common in Stenohya species and is mainly reflected in the morphology of the pedipalps. Male pedipalps are distinctly thinner than the female ones in S.huangi Hu & Zhang, 2012, S.martensi (Schawaller, 1987), and S.pengae Hu & Zhang, 2012 (Schawaller 1987; Hu and Zhang 2012; Zhan et al. 2023). The shapes of pedipalpal femora differ in males and females in S.arcuata Guo, Zang & Zhang, 2019 and S.tengchongensis Yang & Zhang, 2013 (Yang and Zhang 2013; Guo et al. 2019). Male padipalpal chelal hands have special prominences near the base of the fingers in S.bicornuta Guo, Zang & Zhang, 2019, S.curvata Zhao, Zhang & Jia, 2011, S.hamata (Leclerc & Mahnert, 1988), and S.meiacantha Yang & Zhang, 2013 (Leclerc and Mahnert 1988; Zhao et al. 2011; Yang and Zhang 2013; Guo et al. 2019). The males of S.spinata Zhan, Feng & Zhang, 2023 have spinous apophyses on the dorsal side of the median pedipalpal chelal hand, and strong thorns on the femur and patella but these are absent in the females (Zhan et al. 2023).

In this study, three new Stenohya species with sexually dimorphic pedipalps and leg I are described from China: S.gibba sp. nov., S.papillata sp. nov., and S.guangmingensis sp. nov.

﻿Materials and methods

All specimens were preserved in 75% alcohol. Temporary slide mounts were prepared in glycerol. Detailed examinations were carried out with an Olympus BX53 general optical microscope. Photographs and measurements were taken using a Leica M205A stereomicroscope equipped with a Leica DFC550 camera. Drawings were made using the Inkscape ver. 1.0.2.0. Figures were edited and formatted using Adobe Photoshop 2022. The specimens were deposited in the Museum of Hebei University (MHBU), Baoding, China.

Terminology and measurements largely follow Chamberlin (1931), except for the nomenclature of the pedipalps and legs, and the terminology of trichobothria (Harvey 1992); the term “rallum” (for flagellum) is adopted from Judson (2007). The following abbreviations are used in the text for the trichobothria: b = basal; sb = sub-basal; st = sub-terminal; t = terminal; ib = interior basal; isb = interior sub-basal; ist = interior sub-terminal; it = interior terminal; eb = exterior basal; esb = exterior sub-basal; est = exterior sub-terminal; et = exterior terminal.

Distribution.

China (Jiangxi).

Remarks.

The dividing line between basitarsus and telotarsus of the male leg I of this new species is usually indistinct in specimens examined, except for one paratype, which has this line slightly visible (Fig. 16I). There is no other distinct difference among these male specimens and, as a result, we consider this difference in the visibility of the dividing lines as intraspecific variation.

The males of S.guangmingensis, S.gibba, and S.papillata have a specialized leg I, but this new species can be separated by having a distal depression on leg I femur. Females of this new species can be distinguished from other Stenohya species by the following: carapace 1.02–1.10 times longer than broad (1.15–1.28 in S.curvata; 1.13 in S.hainanensis; 1.33–1.49 in S.huangi; 1.15–1.28 in S.pengae; 1.18–1.24 in S.tengchongensis), the presence of 27–31 setae on carapace (24 in S.bicornuta and S.hainanensis; 23 in S.meiacantha and S.tengchongensis; 39–42 in S.papillata); the presence of six long setae on apex of pedipalpal coxa (eight in S.bicornuta and S.papillata; 10 in S.spinata), the pedipalpal patella 3.39–3.46 times longer than broad (2.81–2.86 in S. arcuatа; 4.70–5.31 in S.huangi; 2.68 in S.meiacantha; 3.83–3.93 in S.pengae; 3.53–3.62 in S.spinata; 2.63–2.67 in S.tengchongensis); the presence of 92–94 teeth on pedipalpal movable chelal finger (115–119 in S. arcuatа; 68 in S.bomica; 46–51 in S.huangi; 76 in S.meiacantha; 79–87 in S.gibba; 45–55 in S.pengae; 76–78 in S.spinata); and the presence of 95–98 teeth on pedipalpal fixed chelal finger (124–129 in S. arcuatа; 105 in S.bicornuta; 76 in S.bomica; 63–69 in S.huangi; 84 in S.meiacantha; 66–79 in S.pengae) (Zhao and Zhang 2011; Zhao et al. 2011; Hu and Zhang 2012; Yang and Zhang 2013; Guo and Zhang 2016; Guo et al. 2019; Zhan et al. 2023).

﻿Discussion

In addition to sexually dimorphic pedipalp, the three new species described here a have uniquely sexual dimorphic leg I; that is, the femur and patella are enlarged or have an inward depression, and the basitarsus and telotarsus are fused or semi-fused in males. In particular, the male of S.gibba has a large columnar projection on the basitarsus and telotarsus of leg I, which has not been reported in other Stenohya species. According to Zhan et al. (2023) the three potential functions of the sexually dimorphic pedipalp are controlling the female during mating, attracting a female during courtship, or serving as a weapon in male-to-male competition. Given the proximity of the pedipalp and leg I, the specialized leg I may interact with the pedipalp in some manner while conducting any of these three potential functions. The discovery of new species enriches our knowledge of the morphological diversity of Stenohya pseudoscorpions. The various sexually dimorphic structures imply that Stenohya species may have differing adaptive methods under sexual or natural selection.
