﻿Abstract

Neohelicomyces species are a group of helicosporous hyphomycetes with the potential to produce secondary metabolites. During our investigation of helicosporous fungi, six collections were isolated from both terrestrial and freshwater habitats in Guizhou Province, China. Based on multigene phylogenetic analysis (ITS, LSU, tef1α and rpb2), coupled with morphological data, three new Neohelicomyces species, viz. N.guizhouensis, N.helicosporus and N.hydei were established. A list of accepted Neohelicomyces species with molecular data was provided. The strain of Neohelicomycespallidus (UAMH 10535) was synonymised under N.denticulatus based on molecular data.

Genus Neohelicomyces Z.L. Luo, Bhat & K.D. Hyde (Tubeufiaceae) is a group of helicosporous hyphomycetes which are characterised by coiled and helical conidia (Luo et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2018b; Tibpromma et al. 2018; Crous et al. 2019a, 2019b; Dong et al. 2020; Hsieh et al. 2021; Lu et al. 2022; Yang et al. 2023). That genus, typified by N.aquaticus, was established by Luo et al. (2017), based on morphological characterisation and phylogenetic analysis of the combined ITS, LSU and tef1α sequence data. In their study, three new species (including the type species), N.aquaticus, N.grandisporus and N.submersus, were collected from submerged decaying wood substrata in Yunnan Province, China. Thereafter, Tibpromma et al. (2018) reported the fourth Neohelicomyces species, N.pandanicola from Pandanus sp. in the same province, China. Moreover, Lu et al. (2018b) re-assessed Tubeufiales, based on multi-locus phylogeny and morphology and introduced a new species, N.hyalosporus, but synonymised the following four strains under Neohelicomycespallidus, i.e. Helicosporiumpallidum (CBS 962.69 and UAMH 10535), Tubeufiahelicomyces (CBS 271.52) and T.paludosa (CBS 245.49) (Linder 1929; Goos 1986; Tsui et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2007; Ruibal et al. 2009). More recently, Crous et al. (2019a, 2019b) have introduced two species, Neohelicomycesdeschampsiae and N.melaleucae, collected from terrestrial habitats in Europe (Germany) and North America (USA), respectively. Subsequent studies reporting novel Neohelicomyces species are listed chronologically as follows: N.dehongensis and N.thailandicus – collected from freshwater bodies in China and Thailand (Dong et al. 2020); N.longisetosus – collected from submerged decaying culm of Miscanthusfloridulus (Poaceae) in Taiwan Province, China (Hsieh et al. 2021); N.hainanensis – collected from decaying wood in a terrestrial habitat in China (Lu et al. 2022); and N.dehongensis – collected from decaying submerged wood in China (Yang et al. 2023).

To date, Neohelicomyces comprises 13 species, all of which have molecular data (Table 2) and are distributed in Asia (mostly in China), Europe (Germany, Czechia, Italy and Netherlands) and North America (USA). They occur as saprobes on various plant litter in both freshwater and terrestrial habitats (e.g. on Deschampsiacespitosa, Fraxinusexcelsior, Melaleucastyphelioides, Miscanthusfloridulus, Pandanus sp. and Quercusrobur), according to Linder (1929), Goos (1989), Tsui et al. (2006), Zhao et al. (2007); Luo et al. (2017), Lu et al. (2018b), Tibpromma et al. (2018), Crous et al. (2019a, 2019b), Dong et al. (2020), Hsieh et al. (2021), Lu et al. (2022) and Yang et al. (2023). All of the Neohelicomyces species that have been reported so far only occur in the asexual morph. Their sexual morph is yet to be documented. Neohelicomyces genus is characterised by gregarious colonies on natural substrates, with colours ranging from white, greyish-brown, to yellowish-green and pinkish. In addition, this genus is depicted by macronematous, branched and/or unbranched conidiophores, monoblastic to polyblastic, integrated, terminal or intercalary conidiogenous cells with lateral minute denticles and acropleurogenous or pleurogenous, helicoid conidia (Luo et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2018b; Tibpromma et al. 2018; Crous et al. 2019a, 2019b; Dong et al. 2020; Hsieh et al. 2021; Lu et al. 2022; Yang et al. 2023).

Previous studies have primarily focused on systematics and taxonomic research of helicosporous hyphomycetes (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2010; Boonmee et al. 2011, 2014; Lu et al. 2017a, 2017b, 2017c, 2018a, 2023a, 2023b; Kuo and Goh 2018; Lu and Kang 2020; Li et al. 2022a, 2022b; Ma et al. 2023a, 2023b; Xiao et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2023). Recent studies on the natural products of some members from Neohelicomyces genus have shown that two compounds from N.hyalosporus (PF11-1) exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against human cancer cells (A549, TCA, RD) (Zheng et al. 2023). Therefore, the metabolites of Neohelicomyces species may be a potential source for preparing and developing drugs for human tumour prevention and management.

In this study, six helicosporous taxa were collected from both freshwater and terrestrial habitats in Zunyi City, Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province, China. Based on morphological descriptions, illustrations and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, three novel species are herein introduced, namely Neohelicomycesguizhouensis, N.helicosporus and N.hydei.

﻿Materials and methods

﻿Sampling of the collections, macro- and micro- morphological examinations

Specimens were collected from freshwater and terrestrial habitats from August 2021 to March 2022 in Zunyi City and Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province, China. Specimens from freshwater habitats were cultured at room temperatures, with moisture maintained for 1–2 weeks. Fungal colonies and micromorphological structures on the surface of the natural substrates were observed using a stereomicroscope (SMZ-168, Nikon, Japan) and photographed using an ECLIPSE Ni compound microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with a Canon 90D digital camera.

﻿Isolations and material deposition

Single spore isolations were conducted following the method described by Chomnunti et al. (2014). Subsequently, the germinating spores were aseptically transferred to fresh potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates, following the method outlined in Senanayake et al. (2020). Fungal mycelia were cultured on PDA and incubated at 25 °C for 45 to 50 days. Their colony characteristics, such as shape, colour, size, margin and elevation, were monitored and recorded.

Dried fungal specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Herb. HKAS), Kunming, China and the Herbarium of Guizhou Academy of Agriculture Sciences (Herb. GZAAS), Guiyang, China. Cultures were deposited at the Guizhou Culture Collection (GZCC), Guiyang, China. The descriptions of the newly-introduced taxa were uploaded in the Faces of Fungi webpage following the guidelines outlined in Jayasiri et al. (2015). The new species were registered in the MycoBank database (https://www.mycobank.org/).

﻿DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing

Fresh mycelia were scraped with a sterilised toothpick and transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Biospin Fungus Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (BioFlux, China), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Primer pairs ITS5/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), LR0R/LR5 (Vilgalys and Hester 1990), EF1-983F/EF1-2218R (Rehner and Buckley 2005) and fRPB2-5F/fRPB2-7cR (Liu et al. 1999) were used to amplify ITS, LSU, tef1α and rpb2 sequence fragments, respectively. The PCR amplification reactions were carried out in a 50 µl reaction volume, including 2 µl DNA, 2 µl of the forward and reverse primer each and 44 µl of 1.1 × T3 Supper PCR Mix (Qingke Biotech, Chongqing, China). The thermal-cycling parameters of the ITS, LSU, tef1α and rpb2 regions were as follows: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, elongation at 72 °C for 10 s and final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR products were detected by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and the sequencing results were provided by Beijing Qingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

﻿Phylogenetic analyses

The sequence data of our new taxa were verified using BioEdit v. 7.0.5.3 (Hall 1999). The forward and reverse sequence data of LSU, tef1α and rpb2 regions were assembled using SeqMan v. 7.0.0 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA; Swindell and Plasterer (1997)). The sequences incorporated in this study were downloaded from GenBank (Table 1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The single gene datasets were aligned using MAFFT v.7.473 (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/, Katoh et al. (2019)) and trimmed using trimAl.v1.2rev59 software (Capella-Gutiérrez et al. 2009). The aligned datasets were concatenated (LSU-ITS-tef1α-rpb2) using SequenceMatrix-Windows-1.7.8 software (Vaidya et al. 2011). The Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree was performed in IQ Tree webserver (http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at/, Nguyen et al. (2015); Zeng et al. (2023)). To obtain a well-resolved taxonomic placement of Neohelicomyces spp., we added Muripulchra and a few Tubeufia species as ingroup taxa in our analyses. Helicotubeufiahydei (MFLUCC 17-1980) and H.jonesii (MFLUCC 17-0043) were selected as the outgroup taxa (Liu et al. 2018).

Bayesian Inference (BI) was performed using OFPT methods described by Zeng et al. (2023). The aligned Fasta file was converted to a Nexus format file for Bayesian analysis using AliView v. 1.27 (Daniel et al. 2010). The best-fit substitution model of the four gene matrices was selected using MrModelTest 2.3 under the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Nylander et al. 2008).

The multi-gene phylogenetic trees were visualised using FigTree v. 1.4.4 and the final layout of the phylogram was edited using Adobe Illustrator CC 2019v. 23.1.0 (Adobe Systems, USA). Photo-plates and scale bars were processed using Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 (Adobe Systems, USA) and Tarosoft (R) Image Frame Work programme, respectively.

﻿Phylogenetic results

The phylogenetic positions of our newly-introduced species were determined, based on multi-gene (ITS-LSU-tef1α-rpb2) phylogenetic analysis. The concatenated sequence matrix comprised 3,353 characters (ITS: 1–547, LSU: 548–1,405, tef1α: 1,406–2,308 and rpb2: 2,309–3,353) across 40 ingroup and two outgroup taxa (Helicotubeufiahydei and H.jonesii). Both the ML and BI analyses of the concatenated ITS, LSU, tef1α and rpb2 datasets yielded similar tree topologies. Fig. 1 illustrates the best scoring ML tree, with a final likelihood value of -17,148.363. The decision to introduce new species based on a polyphasic approach follow the guidelines of Chethana et al. (2021).

With reference to the multi-gene phylogram (Fig. 1), our collections represent three distinct Neohelicomyces species within Tubeufiaceae. Our isolates, GZCC 23–0725 and GZCC 23–0726, cluster together with the clade comprising N.denticulatus, N.deschampsiae, N.pallidus and N.pandanicola. GZCC 23–0633 and GZCC 23–0634 group together and this clade forms a distinct lineage with N.hyalosporus (GZCC 16–0086) with 100% ML and 1.00 PP support. In addition, GZCC 23–0727 and GZCC 23–0728 form a clade together and are sister to N.aquaticus (MFLUCC 16–0993 and KUMCC 15–0463) with 100% ML and 0.95 PP support.

Notes.

The newly-identified strains (GZCC 23–0725 and GZCC 23–0726) are phylogenetically grouped with N.denticulatus, N.deschampsiae, N.pallidus and N.pandanicola (Fig. 1). However, it is most closely related to N.deschampsiae (CPC 33686) phylogenetically and a comparison of polymorphic nucleotides across ITS and LSU sequences between GZCC 23–0725 and N.deschampsiae (CPC 33686) revealed nucleotide base disparities of 34/546 bp (6.3%, including fourteen gaps) and 4/860 bp (0.5%, including 0 gap), respectively. Morphologically, N.guizhouensis is most similar to N.dehongensis in having macronematous, mononematous, erect, flexuous branched conidiophores and solitary, helicoid, hyaline conidia (Dong et al. 2020). However, N.dehongensis can be delineated from N.guizhouensis by its longer conidia (145–210 μm vs. 94.5–148.5 μm) and wider conidial filaments (20–25 μm vs. 18–21.5 μm) (Dong et al. 2020). Therefore, based on the findings from both molecular and morphological evidence, we propose N.guizhouensis as a new species.

Notes.

Our isolates (GZCC 23–0633 and GZCC 23–0634) are morphologically similar to Neohelicomyceshainanensis (Lu et al. 2022), but the phylogenetic analyses revealed that GZCC 23–0633 and GZCC 23–0634 cluster together and this clade is sister to N.hyalosporus (GZCC 16–0086) with 100% ML/1.00 PP support (Fig. 1). The polymorphism nucleotides comparison of ITS, LSU, tef1α and rpb2 sequence data between GZCC 23–0633 and Neohelicomyceshyalosporus (GZCC 16–0086), reveals nucleotide base differences of 29/527 bp (5.5%, including thirteen gaps), 2/844 bp (0.2%, including 0 gap), 27/892 bp (3.0%, including 0 gap) and 37/893 bp (4.1%, including 0 gap), respectively. Additionally, our species displays a reddish-brown pigmentation on PDA, but this feature was not observed in N.hainanensis and N.hyalosporus (Lu et al. 2018b, 2022). Furthermore, our species differs from N.hainanensis in having longer conidia (103–170 μm vs. up to 136 μm) and from N.hyalosporus in having shorter conidiophores (105–199 μm vs. 210–290 μm) (Lu et al. 2018b, 2022). Therefore, based on the phylogenetic and morphological differences, we introduce N.helicosporus herein as a novel species.

Material examined.

China, Guizhou Province, Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Xianheping National Forest Park, 24°97′N, 105°63′E, on decaying wood in a freshwater habitat, 16 March 2022, Jian Ma, XHP1 (HKAS 134925, holotype; GZAAS 23–0621, isotype), ex-type living cultures GZCC 23–0727; Ibid., XHP1.1 (GZAAS 23–0622, paratype), living culture GZCC 23–0728.

Notes.

Our isolates, GZCC 23–0727 and GZCC 23–0728 cluster together and form a sister clade to N.aquaticus (MFLUCC 16–0993 and KUMCC 15–0463) with 96% ML/0.95 PP support. Upon comparison of the nucleotide bases between our isolates and Neohelicomycesaquaticus (MFLUCC 16–0993), the following differences were observed: 1/851 bp (0.1%, including 1 gap) across LSU, 13/869 bp (1.5%, including 1 gap) across tef1α and 46/945 bp (4.9%, with no gaps) across rpb2. Unfortunately, we were unable to compare the differences in nucleotide bases across ITS as our isolates (GZCC 23–0727 and GZCC 23–0728) lack ITS sequence data. Despite several trials using different PCR conditions, we were unable to amplify the ITS locus for our strain (GZCC 23–0727 and GZCC 23–0728) successfully. Morphologically, our isolates (GZAAS 23–0621 and GZAAS 23–0622) differ from N.aquaticus (MFLU 16–2543) as they have mostly branched and hyaline conidiophores, polyblastic, terminal and hyaline conidiogenous cells and acropleurogenous conidia (Luo et al. 2017). Based on phylogenetic placement and morphology, we identify GZCC 23–0727 and GZCC 23–0728 as a single species, Neohelicomyceshydei.

﻿Discussion

In this study, six helicosporous taxa were collected for the first time in northern and south-western regions of Guizhou Province, China. Based on multigene (ITS-LSU-tef1α-rpb2) phylogenetic analysis, coupled with morphological descriptions and illustrations, we establish three novel Neohelicomyces species, namely N.guizhouensis, N.helicosporus and N.hydei.

A list of accepted Neohelicomyces species with known sequence data is also provided (Table 2). There are 16 species (including three new species described in the present study) in Neohelicomyces, of which ten were found from freshwater habitats, while the remaining six ones were reported from terrestrial habitats, with 13 species collected from China (Linder 1929; Goos 1989; Tsui et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2007; Luo et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2018b, 2022; Tibpromma et al. 2018; Crous et al. 2019a, 2019b; Dong et al. 2020; Hsieh et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2023). Neohelicomycespallidus is the most widely distributed member of Neohelicomyces genus and has been reported from terrestrial habitats in various regions of the world, including China, Czechia, Italy, Japan, Netherlands and USA (Linder 1929; Goos 1989; Tsui et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2007; Lu et al. 2018b). Given that most Neohelicomyces species and many helicosporous genera (Berkleasmium, Helicoma, Helicosporium, Helicotubeufia, Neohelicosporium, Parahelicomyces, Pleurohelicosporium, Pseudotubeufia and Tubeufia) in Tubeufiaceae were reported from China, we infer that China is a biodiversity hotspot for helicosporous fungi (Lu et al. 2018b; Hsieh et al. 2021; Ma et al. 2023a). Therefore, we anticipate to discover and classify more helicosporous taxa from different habitats. A plausible explanation for the prevalent number of Neohelicomyces species in China might be attributed to limited sampling in other areas or they probably occur in understudied hosts and substrates.

The conidial morphology of most Neohelicomyces species closely resembles those of Helicomyces and the typical helicoid Tubeufia genera (Zhao et al. 2007; Luo et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2018b; Ma et al. 2023b). However, most Neohelicomyces species can easily be distinguished by their longer, hyphae-like and conspicuous conidiophores, when compared to those of Helicomyces and Tubeufia (Morgan 1892; Linder 1929; Rao and Rao 1964; Goos 1985; Zhao et al. 2007; Hyde et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2017b, 2018b, 2023b; Kuo and Goh 2018; Tian et al. 2022; Ma et al. 2023b). Only two species, Neohelicomyceslongisetosus and N.thailandicus, exhibit morphological variations in conidiophores when compared to other Neohelicomyces species. However, molecular data confirm their taxonomic placement in Neohelicomyces (Dong et al. 2020; Hsieh et al. 2021). For example, Neohelicomyceslongisetosus resembles Helicosporiumflavum in having shorter, unbranched and less septate conidiophores and terminal, ampulliform conidiogenous cells. Nonetheless, they are delineated, based on their distinct conidial morphology and DNA molecular data (Brahmanage et al. 2017; Hsieh et al. 2021).

Herein, based on multigene phylogenetic analyses, we reclassify Neohelicomycespallidus (UAMH 10535) under N.denticulatus. Nevertheless, we were unable to compare its morphology as this taxon lacks morphological data (Kodsueb et al. 2006; Tsui and Berbee 2006; Tsui et al. 2006; Lu et al. 2018b). In our phylogenetic analyses, Neohelicomycespallidus (UAMH 10535) clusters with Neohelicomycesdenticulatus (GZCC 19-0444) with 93% ML and 1.00 PP support. In comparison of their sequence data, there were only four nucleotide differences across ITS and one nucleotide difference across LSU (Lu et al. 2018b; Yang et al. 2023). Additionally, our phylogenetic analyses showed that Tubeufiaamazonensis (ATCC 42524) shares a sister relationship to Neohelicomyces species, which suggests that this taxon neither belongs to genus Neohelicomyces nor to genus Tubeufia. However, due to the lack of morphological data about Tubeufiaamazonensis (ATCC 42524), we were unable to compare its features with other Neohelicomyces and Tubeufia species. Therefore, Tubeufiaamazonensis (ATCC 42524) is re-categorised here as a member of Tubeufiaceae (ATCC 42524). Further studies focusing on the re-collections, isolations and morphological examinations of these strains are a prerequisite to having a more stable and resolved taxonomy.
