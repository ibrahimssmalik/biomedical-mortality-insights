Introduction

In Pakistan, HIV training programs, especially for health professionals working in HIV treatment centers, are limited. Consequently, there is little data about HIV awareness among physicians and allied health workers and how it may affect their care for people living with HIV (PLWH). Recently, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM) grant Principal Recipient UNDP engaged an NGO experienced in HIV/AIDS training, on a competitive basis, to develop a training manual and conduct training of all categories of HIV treatment centers staff. The goal of this study was to assess the training program's influence on trainees' (both physicians and allied health staff) knowledge and abilities and describe its major lessons.

Methodology

This was a one-group pre-post test study, carried out between January 17 and February 22, 2023. The study was carried out in three phases. In the first phase, a team of experts developed an antiretroviral treatment (ART) training manual. In the second phase, 9- and three-day training workshops were conducted in six different cities of Pakistan, which were attended by physicians and allied health staff working in different HIV treatment centers across Pakistan. The workshops had plenary lectures, discussions, role plays, video cases, and case studies. In the third phase, a quiz, comprising multiple/best choice questions (MCQs/BCQs) and true and false questions, was administered before (pre) and after the workshop (post) to assess the impact of these training sessions in enhancing the level of HIV knowledge, especially related to ART. The workshop was attended by a total of 256 health workers from different cities in Pakistan. The participants had backgrounds in medical science, psychology, laboratory science, nursing, and computer science. Pre-and post-test responses were statistically analyzed to determine the impact of the training program on participant's knowledge. For this, the Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to test data normality, followed by the application of paired t-test or Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for normally and non-normally distributed data, respectively. Finally, a chi-square test was applied to examine the significant (p<0.05) association between training workshops and improvement in the participant’s level of understanding of HIV. In all statistical tests, p<0.05 was considered significant. 

Results

The results from our study showed that before the training session, both physicians and allied staff possessed limited knowledge about HIV-related domains. After the workshops, participants from all cities demonstrated a uniform enhancement of knowledge related to different HIV-related domains, evident from the improvement in post-test scores compared to pre-test scores (p<0.0001). The chi-square test showed a significant association between training workshops and improvement in the participant’s level of understanding about HIV (p-values for BCQ, MCQ, and true and false: 0.001, 0.0047, and 0.0024, respectively).

Conclusions

Pre- and post-test evaluation provides an objective, data-driven method for measuring the impact of educational interventions in improving healthcare workers' awareness about HIV. The results emphasize the role of continuous workshops and training programs in enhancing the knowledge and understanding of healthcare and allied health workers regarding HIV.

HIV prevalence in the general population of Pakistan is approximately 0.2% [1]. However, HIV exists as a concentrated epidemic in key population groups such as people who inject drugs, transgender sex workers, male sex workers, men who have sex with men, and female sex workers, where the prevalence is approximately 38.4%, 7.5%, 5.6%, 5.4%, and 2.2%, respectively [2,3]. Furthermore, the number of new cases has increased rapidly in the past 10 years, and several new outbreaks have occurred in Pakistan in recent years, including the 2019 HIV outbreak in Larkana, where more than 1,000 children were found infected with HIV [2-9].

Globally, the field of HIV treatment and care has been experiencing significant growth, with the expansion of healthcare provider education and training being identified as a crucial factor contributing to the accelerated improvement in the delivery of high-quality care [10-13]. Several studies have shown that the implementation of intensive and interactive professional training workshops focused on HIV can lead to enhanced knowledge, attitudes, and willingness among healthcare professionals (HCPs) to deliver comprehensive care to individuals affected by HIV [14,15]. Here both physicians and allied health workers play a crucial role in enhancing the well-being of people living with HIV (PLWH) and their families through the provision of high-quality physical care and emotional support [16]. Studies have found that quantitative surveys and patient records were the most used assessment methods, providing an outcome of learning and downstream results in HCPs; however, there still are gaps in the literature regarding objective information on trainee behavior change [17]. Most studies use pre- and post-training tests to assess trainee learning, likely because these tests can be conducted easily after training sessions without additional follow-up; however, they are used only for testing factual knowledge [18]. However, there is limited information regarding the level of HIV knowledge possessed by both physicians and allied health workers in different regions globally, especially Pakistan, and its potential impact on their provision of care for PLWH.

To strategize and develop the skills, abilities, and resources of Pakistan’s healthcare system and to provide better HIV care, sustainable processes need to be formed based on partnerships between local academic institutions and antiretroviral treatment (ART) centers [19]. In Pakistan, national and provincial AIDS control programs have established more than 51 HIV treatment centers throughout the country [20]. However, comprehensive HIV training programs, especially for the HIV treatment center staff, are limited, and consequently, information regarding the level of HIV knowledge possessed by both physicians and allied health workers is scanty. Additionally, very little is known about how different education interventions contribute to the improvement of the level of HIV knowledge in Pakistani healthcare workers. Therefore, comprehensive training of all categories of HIV treatment center staff is necessary to provide high-quality and user-friendly services to PLWH. Recently, supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM), and Bridge Consultants Foundation, an NGO experienced in HIV/AIDS training developed a training manual and conducted training of all categories of HIV treatment center staff.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the training program on enhancing the knowledge and skills of trainees (both physicians and allied health workers) and document the key lessons learned from this training program.

Materials and methods

Training manual and workshops

This was a one-group pre-post test study, comprising development and implementation phases. In the development phase, a three-member team of experts, comprising an infectious disease specialist, a microbiologist/laboratory expert, and a public health physician, all with substantial experience in the HIV domain, developed the ART training manual.

In the implementation phase, a team of trainers conducted training sessions for staff from 51 ART centers across Pakistan. For logistic reasons, a total of six cities (Faisalabad, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Multan, and Peshawar) were selected as training locations, and representative staff from ART centers were invited. 

Three full-day training workshops were offered to all participants, between January 17 and February 22, 2023, which were attended by a total of 256 healthcare and allied health workers from different cities in Pakistan. The participants had backgrounds in medical science, psychology, laboratory science, nursing, and computer science.

In each workshop, different HIV experts (physicians, scientists, and public health specialists) delivered comprehensive sessions on different HIV knowledge domains, including the ART training manual (see Appendix; Table 4). The workshops had plenary lectures, discussions, role plays, video cases, and case studies.

Pre- and post-test quizzes and participant feedback

A quiz (available at https://bityl.co/QFED), comprising multiple choice questions (MCQs), best choice questions (BCQs), and true and false questions, was administered before (pre) and right after the workshop (post) to assess the impact of these training sessions in enhancing the level of HIV knowledge, especially related to ART. At the end of the workshop, a feedback form was administered to each participant to evaluate the participant’s experience/opinions about the workshop and the questions (see Appendix; Table 5). The study data was analyzed between March 1 and July 15, 2023. The data was collected after obtaining written informed consent from the participants. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Bridge Consultant Foundation.

Statistical analysis

The pre- and post-test responses were statistically analyzed to determine the impact of the training program on participants' knowledge. For this, the Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to test data normality, followed by the application of paired t-test or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, for normally (physicians test results) and non-normally distributed (allied health worker's test results) data, respectively, to examine the improvement in participants tests scores after the workshop (compared to the pre-test scores). Finally, a chi-square test was applied to examine the significant association between training workshops and improvement in the participant’s level of understanding of HIV. In all statistical tests, a p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9 for MS Windows.

Results

Training outcomes 

Overall, the pre-test results from all workshops showed that physicians were able to answer 56%, 44%, and 59% of BCQs, MCQs, and true/false questions correctly before the workshop, while after the workshop they were able to answer 88%, 65%, and 79% of BCQs, MCQs, and true/false questions correctly (Figure 1). Similarly, the pre-test results for other staff showed that they were able to 57%, 36%, and 56% of BCQs, MCQs, and true/false questions correctly before the workshop, while after the workshop they were able to answer 77%, 54%, and 76% of BCQs, MCQs, and true/false questions correctly (Figure 1).

The t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test for pre- and post-workshop scores showed that participants from all cities demonstrated a uniform enhancement of knowledge related to different HIV-related domains, evident from the improvement in post-test scores compared to pre-test scores (p<0.0001). The chi-square test also showed a significant association between training workshops and improvement in the participant’s level of understanding about HIV (p-values for BCQ, MCQ, and true or false: 0.001, 0.0047, and 0.0024, respectively). 

The results from different cities also showed a significant improvement in the level of knowledge about HIV in both physicians and allied health workers post-workshop, where the most significant improvement was observed in both physicians and allied health workers from Peshawar (Table 1). For all cities, the chi-square test showed a significant association between training workshops and improvement in the participant’s level of understanding of HIV (p=0.001-0.004).

Discussion

The objective of the current study was to assess the impact of the training program in enhancing the HIV-related knowledge of the physicians and allied health staff working in different HIV treatment centers across Pakistan. The pre-assessment results showed that both physicians and allied staff possessed limited knowledge about HIV-related domains. After the workshops, participants from all cities demonstrated a uniform enhancement of knowledge related to different HIV-related domains (p<0.0001).

Assessment of behavior change after training programs helps in determining whether the objectives of the training interventions have been achieved; however, very few studies (a total of 30) have focused on HIV, showing surveys and interviews as a common method used for assessing behavioral changes in trainees [21]. The results from our study showed that prior to the training session, both physicians and allied staff possessed limited HIV-related knowledge domains. Our findings were in line with other published studies [22-25]. For example, a study from India showed that 85% of nurses did not adhere to the universal safety protocol, while 70% held the belief that HIV positivity and AIDS were interchangeable concepts [15]. Similarly, 13.5% of physicians were found to be unaware of the transmission of HIV through blood [15]. Another study from Madagascar showed that approximately 75% of the healthcare personnel, including physicians, midwives, nurses, medical students, and nursing auxiliaries, lacked essential knowledge about HIV transmission, testing, and management. For example, approximately 66% of HCPs indicated that they had never provided recommendations to patients regarding HIV testing, while 79% expressed concerns about their susceptibility to contracting HIV, primarily due to potential occupational exposure [26]. These findings identify an immense need to offer training programs to HIV physicians and allied health staff, especially those working in different HIV treatments and interacting with PLWH daily [11-16].

Using indicators from standard guidelines is another way to assess training programs such as TB control programs, where case detection and treatment success rate are the outcome indicators used for training programs [27]. However, for HIV training programs, HIV testing rate and proportion of patients with undetectable viral loads were used as outcome indicators. This indicators-based evaluation model, known as the goal-based Kirkpatrick model, which was developed in the 1960s, is still the most used evaluation framework and shaped the foundation for other frameworks [28]. Based on this need, we developed an HIV training manual and standardized evaluation framework while also offering training workshops across different cities of Pakistan. Our results showed that the workshops were effective in addressing the knowledge deficit and significantly improving (p<0.001) the awareness related to HIV knowledge domains among healthcare practitioners and allied health workers. Although the data on such educational interventions from Pakistan is limited, our findings are supported by a recent educational intervention study from Lahore, Pakistan showing a significant improvement in the level of HIV knowledge domains such as transmission, counseling, care, and interaction, after the educational intervention [29].

We anticipate certain limitations of our study. For example, information regarding different HIV domains was assessed; however, objective information on trainee behavior change and improvement in HIV care delivery could not be evaluated. Follow-up studies assessing the improvement in training behavior and HIV care delivery could provide valuable information about the long-term efficacy of such training programs. 

Conclusions

In conclusion, the study indicates that the comprehensive training program, offered in the form of workshops, successfully bridged the knowledge gap related to HIV among healthcare practitioners and allied health workers. The positive impact of these workshops, evident from a significant improvement in post-test scores compared to pre-test (p<0.001), suggests that continuous and comprehensive HIV-related training is imperative for enhancing and sustaining the knowledge base of HCPs serving in HIV treatment centers throughout Pakistan.

Given the dynamic nature of HIV treatment and care, regular training and updates are necessary to ensure that healthcare practitioners, including physicians and allied health workers, are equipped with up-to-date information and best practices in managing HIV. Therefore, healthcare authorities and organizations should prioritize ongoing HIV-related training programs to ensure that healthcare practitioners remain well-informed and adept in providing optimal care to individuals living with HIV in Pakistan.
