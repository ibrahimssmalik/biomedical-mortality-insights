Abstract

Increasing lithium contents within the lattice of positive electrode materials is projected in pursuit of high‐energy‐density batteries. However, it intensifies the release of lattice oxygen and subsequent gas evolution during operations. This poses significant challenges for managing internal pressure of batteries, particularly in terms of the management of gas evolution in composite electrodes—an area that remains largely unexplored. Conventional assumptions postulate that the total gas evolution is estimated by multiplying the total particle count by the quantities of gas products from an individual particle. Contrarily, this investigation on overlithiated materials—a system known to release the lattice oxygen—demonstrates that loading densities and inter‐particle spacing in electrodes significantly govern gas evolution rates, leading to distinct extents of gas formation despite of an equivalent quantity of released lattice oxygen. Remarkably, this study discoveres that O2 and CO2 evolution rates are proportional to 1O2 concentration by the factor of second and first‐order, respectively. This indicates an exceptionally greater change in the evolution rate of O2 compared to CO2 depending on local 1O2 concentration. These insights pave new routes for more sophisticated approaches to manage gas evolution within high‐energy‐density batteries.

This study explores the impact of electrode configuration on gas evolution in high‐energy‐density batteries, Inter‐particle spacing depending on electrode loading densities significantly impacts the extent of O2 and CO2 evolution. This phenomena is attributed to the proportional relationships between O2 and CO2 evolution rates and 1O2 concentration. This provides insights for managing gas evolution in composite electrodes for enhanced performance.

pmc1 Introduction

As the rapid paradigm shift to electric vehicles (EVs) drives pressing demands for Li‐ion batteries as power sources, the development of positive electrode materials has progressed in pursuit of achieving high‐energy‐density.[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] One of the few promising routes concerns increasing the lithium content within the lattice structure of positive electrode active materials, commonly referred to as overlithiated materials.[ 6 , 7 , 8 ] However, this intensifies the irreversible release of oxygen atoms from the lattice structure at high degrees of delithiation,[ 9 , 10 , 11 ] which has been recurrently held responsible for gas evolution reactions.[ 12 , 13 , 14 ] This presents considerable challenges for the management of the internal pressure of batteries during operations due to the substantial accumulation of gas products in electrode systems over cycles. Consequently, this exacerbates safety concerns in batteries, such as swelling or rupture of cell casing.

In the complex electrochemical environment of a battery's positive electrode,[ 15 ] the lattice oxygen is released as a reactive singlet oxygen (1Δg or 1O2). This reactive singlet oxygen can either evolve into inert triplet oxygen (3O2) through a self‐quenching process or form CO2 that initiates further electrolyte decomposition reactions.[ 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 ] The quantity of 1O2 released from each particle is critically determined by the intrinsic properties of the material during cycling.[ 18 , 19 ] However, the local consumption rate of 1O2 in each reaction pathway within composite electrodes, particularly in those producing O2 and CO2, holds even greater significance. This rate is crucial in determining the extent of gas evolution reactions and the consequent formation of side‐products, which, in turn, drive a variety of decomposition reactions.[ 13 ] Despite its paramount importance, the fundamental principle governing the reaction kinetics of gas evolution in composite electrodes characterized by complex and intertwined particle networks remains largely underexplored. This gap in knowledge necessitates a comprehensive understanding in consideration of two major aspects: the response of each gas evolution rates to changes in local 1O2 concentration, and the influence of composite electrode configuration (i.e. particle‐particle distribution) on the local 1O2 environment and the overall gas evolution rates.[ 14 ]

To precisely establish the relationship between gas evolution rates and 1O2 concentration in composite electrodes, it is essential to methodically vary 1O2 concentration at the electrode level. This can be achieved by using an overlithiated catthode designed to release a tunable amount of 1O2 across various cycling conditions. Moreover, a selective assessment must be conducted to isolate the 1O2– driven gas evolution reactions from other potential gas–generating mechanisms that may concurrently occur at high potentials.[ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ] Consequently, the kinetics of gas evolution should be scrutinized in a scenario where 1O2 is abundantly released, thereby minimizing the interference from other types of gas evolution processes.

In this study, we utilize Li6CoO4—a compound known for the substantial release of lattice oxygen at low potential due to its labile oxygen states[ 26 ]—as a model system to probe the kinetics of gas evolution as a function of 1O2 concentration, within a voltage range from ≈3.5 to 4.3 V vs Li/Li+ that is compatible for conventional battery electrolytes. To discern the correlation between gas evolution rates and 1O2 concentration, we quantitatively analyzed the evolution of O2 and CO2 at various 1O2 levels using online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS). We observed that O2 evolution, resulting from the self‐quenching of 1O2, showed a quadratic relationship with increasing 1O2 concentration, indicative of a second‐order reaction. In contrast, CO2 evolution, arising from the interaction of the electrolyte with 1O2, appeared to conform a first‐order reaction relative to 1O2 concentration. Remarkably, our results revealed that the distribution of products from competing reactions can be influenced by the local 1O2 concentration, which is affected by the distribution of 1O2–releasing particles within a composite electrode, despite the equivalence in average amount. Therefore, we conclude that the extent of interrelated gas evolution reaction is intricately linked to both the 1O2 concentration and the configuration of composite electrodes.

2 Results and Discussion

2.1 Release of Lattice Oxygen in Li6CoO4 During the Initial Charge

Li6CoO4, classified as an overlithiated material, serves as an effective sacrificial positive electrode that compensates the lithium loss at counter electrodes during the initial cycle through its capability of releasing a substantial amount of lithium.[ 27 , 28 , 29 ] Li6CoO4 locally has a distorted LiO4 tetrahedron in its anti‐fluorite structure that leads to a large density of labile oxygen states below the Fermi level, and hence it exploits improved electrochemical activity of lattice oxygen.[ 26 , 30 ] The galvanostatic profile of Li6CoO4 during the initial charge to 4.3 V versus Li/Li+ showcases two distinct plateaus at ≈3.3 and 3.6 V vs. Li/Li+, as presented in Figure 1a. The first plateau is ascribed to the extraction of Li‐ions concurrent with the oxidation of Co, which is confirmed by X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X‐ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) analyses that characterize the oxidation state of Co (Figure 1a,b). However, the subsequent plateau exhibits a reduction of Co, suggesting an O‐to‐Co charge transfer process that coincides with the release of lattice oxygen. This process likely contributes to the breakdown of Co−O coordination in Li6CoO4, as shown by diminishing intensities of peaks A and B that correspond to 1s→4p and 1s→3d transitions, respectively.[ 31 , 32 ] The release of lattice oxygen, which is inferred from these observations, can be deduced from its implication in gas evolution and structural degradation.

To confirm the release of lattice oxygen, we monitored the structural changes in Li6CoO4 alongside gas evolution during the initial charging. Powder X‐ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that Li6CoO4 has an anti‐fluorite structure with a tetragonal P42/nmc space group as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).[ 26 , 27 ] In situ XRD analysis captured the progressive fading of the main diffraction peaks, which corresponds to (101) and (201) planes. These diffraction peaks gradually faded toward the end of the first plateau and completely vanished by the end of the second plateau as shown in Figure 1c. This loss of long‐range ordering in the crystal structure aligns with the onset of O2 and CO2 (Figure 1d). Therefore, we deduce that the substantial gas evolution and associated degradation in the anti‐fluorite structure of Li6CoO4 is predominantly due to the release of lattice oxygen.

2.2 Release of Lattice Oxygen in Li6CoO4 during the Initial Charge

Building on our findings that the release of lattice oxygen results at 3.6 V vs. Li/Li+, the quantity of lattice oxygen released per mole of Li6CoO4 should theoretically remain constant under identical operational conditions. However, we found that the degree of gas evolution, which hinges on the reaction rates, appears to be substantially influenced by the concentration of reactants varying across different electrode configurations. To explore this further, we constructed electrodes with Li6CoO4 and NCMA (LiNixCoyMnzA11‐x‐y‐zO2, x >0.85) in two separate configurations: a double‐layer composite with densely packed Li6CoO4, and a blend composite where Li6CoO4 particles are dispersed throughout the electrode volume (Figure 2a; Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information). The areal loading of the electrode composite was consistently maintained at 1.2 mg cm−2 for all electrodes. The active materials, constituting 97.5% of the electrode composite by weight, consisted of 3% Li6CoO4 and 97% NCMA. The density of Li6CoO4 was 0.077 g cm−3 for the simple blend electrode whereas it was 0.360 g cm−3 for the double‐layer electrode, as estimated from the thickness obtained from cross‐sectioned SEM images (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information).

The comparative analysis of O2 and CO2 evolution in these configurations during the initial charging (Figure 2b,c) showed that, despite an equal amount of Li6CoO4, the double‐layer composite electrode exhibits significantly greater evolution of both O2 and CO2. This phenomenon persisted regardless of the Li6CoO4 layer's position within the double‐layer structure, suggesting that the effect density of Li6CoO4 – a reflection of particle aggregation – plays a critical role in gas evolution dynamics. With NCMA showing minimal gas evolution (Figure S4, Supporting Information),[ 14 , 33 ] its dilution effect of 1O2 from Li6CoO4 is apparent. This allows to deduce that electrodes with varying effective densities and distribution of Li6CoO4 provide distinct environments that influence the local 1O2 concentration, which consequently leads to changes in the rates of competing reaction pathways. Therefore, it is imperative to establish the kinetics of gas evolution reactions and comprehend their implications on the electrode design.

To establish a more concrete correlation between the gas evolution and 1O2 concentration, we quantitatively assessed the behavior of O2 and CO2 evolution across varying 1O2 concentrations. We could systematically modulate the 1O2 concentration by adjusting the Li6CoO4 density within electrodes, while maintaining areal loading and electrode thickness constant (Figure 3a). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed the homogeneous distribution of Li6CoO4 (Figure S5, Supporting Information). All electrodes were charged at a consistent current density of 40 mAg−1 to maintain uniform electrochemical conditions for Li6CoO4 particles within composite electrodes. Our test across all electrodes showed consistent onset potential for gas evolution (O2 and CO2) and complete capacity utilization for both NCMA and Li6CoO4 (Figure 3b–e), indicating a consistent release of 1O2 per mole of Li6CoO4.

CO2 evolution measured in the electrode solely composed of NCMA (open hexagon) was included in linearly fitted line to consider CO2 evolved under absence of Li6CoO4.

The relationship between O2 evolution and Li6CoO4 density during the initial charge is plotted in Figure 3f. A quadratic increase in O2 evolution was observed with rising Li6CoO4 density, fitting a second‐degree polynomial trend. This trend is further substantiated by a linear correlation between the square root of detected O2 and Li6CoO4 density (Figure 3g). Even with modifications to density by adding conductive carbon instead of NCMA (Figure S6, Supporting Information), the quadratic relationship still persisted. This suggests that the O2 evolution rate escalates with the Li6CoO4 density while maintaining a consistent rate constant. Therefore, O2 evolution, driven by the self‐quenching of 1O2, adheres to a second‐order reaction in relation to the reactant concentration.

Figure 3h illustrates the CO2 evolution during the initial charge, plotted as a function of the density of Li6CoO4. In contrast to O2 evolution, CO2 evolution exhibits a directly proportional increase with Li6CoO4 density. The NCMA electrode without Li6CoO4 only produces 0.027 µmol of the total CO2 evolution (Figure S4, Supporting Information), representing a negligible amount in comparison to CO2 from Li6CoO4. This suggests that the predominant source of CO2 is the chemical oxidation of electrolyte solvent by the release of 1O2, aside from minimal CO2 generation from other sources such as electrochemical oxidation of electrolyte or the decomposition reaction of surface impurities.[ 25 , 34 , 35 , 36 ] Consequently, CO2 evolution mediated by the reaction with 1O2 adheres to a first‐order reaction. This linear increase also suggests that the initial interaction between 1O2 and electrolyte solvent may serve as the rate‐determining step within the CO2 evolution pathway, which involves several intermediate steps.

Throughout the course of CO2 evolution pathway, a variety of side‐products are invariably generated and incorporated in the electrolyte, involving a series of intermediate steps.[ 13 , 16 ] The identification of these side‐products in the liquid phase is critical for delineating the prevailing reaction pathway for CO2 evolution and for mitigating the confounding effects of concurrent side reactions on the measurement of gas evolution rates. Hence, we employed 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect and analyze these side‐products in the liquid phase, thereby isolating and characterizing reaction rates of O2 and CO2 evolution without an interference from ancillary reactions.

Notable side‐products produced in the presence of Li6CoO4 were glycolic acid (3.98 ppm) and formic acid (8.16 ppm) as shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). Glycolic acid is presumably formed through the decomposition of ethylene carbonate (EC), where 1O2 deprotonates the carbon atom in the EC ring to produce water and an aldehyde‐containing intermediate. This intermediate is then hydrolyzed, yielding glycolic acid and CO2.[ 13 , 16 ] Similarly, the formation of formic acid is initiated by 1O2 deprotonating the methyl group on dimethyl carbonate (DMC), leading to the formation of an intermediate that, upon hydrolysis, produces formic acid and CO2 as the end products.

We quantified the amount of glycolic acid and formic acid by measuring their integrated peak area against an internal standard in 1H NMR spectra, which correlates with the number protons in the sample volume.[ 37 ] The amounts of glycolic acid and formic acid rose linearly with increasing density of Li6CoO4 (Figure 4a), establishing the direct relationships with 1O2 concentration. These findings substantiate that the observed liquid products and CO2 are products of the same reaction pathway, which follows a first‐order reaction pattern with respect to 1O2. This further suggests that the initial interaction between 1O2 and electrolyte solvent molecules likely constitute the rate‐determining step in the reaction pathway of CO2 evolution.

2.3 Relative Amount of O2 and CO2 Depending on the Local 1O2 Concentration, Controlled by the Particle‐Particle Distance and Distribution within an Electrode

The distribution of products from competing gas evolution reactions is governed by the proportion of 1O2 consumed in each reaction, which reflects their reaction rates. Notably, O2 evolution follows a second‐order reaction, as physical quenching of 1O2 into 3O2 requires two 1O2 molecules in (Equation 1).[ 18 ] On the other hand, CO2 evolution follows a first‐order reaction (Equation 2). By examining the ratio of evolved O2 and CO2 relative to the Li6CoO4 density, a direct correlation between the rates of O2 and CO2 evolution and 1O2 concentration [1O2] can be deduced (Equation 3). The symbol “r” is the evolution rate, “k” is the rate constant, and “n” is the evolved amount. (1)

Figure 4b presents the linear correlation between the [O2]/[CO2] ratio and Li6CoO4 density during the initial charge, spanning the entire potential range from 3.8 to 4.3 V vs. Li/Li+, with a 4.2% deviation in their slopes. This persistence of distinct reaction orders for O2 and CO2 across various electrochemical biases confirms that the evolution rates of O2 and CO2 are governed by chemical kinetics rather than electrochemical processes, as long as 1O2 is released and participates in the chemical reactions. Additionally, these findings suggest that a greater fraction of 1O2 is utilized in O2 evolution as opposed to CO2 evolution, particularly when 1O2 concentration is locally high within the matrix of composite electrodes.

Overall, the extents of O2 and CO2 evolution may significantly vary depending on the electrode configuration (Scheme 1 ). While the amount of 1O2 released from an individual particle likely remains constant, the local environment pertaining to 1O2 is largely dependent on the loading density and inter‐particle spacing within electrodes. As the evolution rates of O2 and CO2 are proportional to the concentration of 1O2 in quadratic and linear dependencies, respectively, the extents of O2 and CO2 evolution evolve contrastingly in response to changes in the local concentration of 1O2. This, in turn, results in the distinctive product distribution depending on the electrode configuration. Thus, in the design of electrodes, it becomes imperative to employ more sophisticated approaches that consider not only the intrinsic properties of materials but also gas evolution kinetics based on local environments in conjunction with electrode configurations.

3 Conclusion

We comprehensively investigated the gas evolution kinetics in Li6CoO4—a system known to facilely release lattice oxygen—and their implications for electrode configurations. This study found that gas evolution rates significantly shaped by the design of the electrode, especially by the loading density and spatial arrangement of particles within it. By systematically establishing the relationship between the extents of gas evolution and the concentration of 1O2, we discovered that the rates of O2 and CO2 evolution are correlated with the concentration of 1O2 in second and first order, respectively. It became evident that the extent of O2 and CO2 evolution may vary with the inter‐particle spacing, even when the number of particles remains constant within the electrode. The different evolution rates in response to the local 1O2 concentration underscore the impact of particle distribution on gas generation. This comprehensive examination of gas evolution kinetics in the context of overlithiated positive electrode configurations offers valuable insights for the strategic design of electrodes. Such designs aim to control the product distribution from competing reactions, optimizing the performance based on our understanding of reaction kinetics.

4 Experimental Section

Electrode Preparation and Electrochemical Operation

Pristine Li6CoO4, and LiNixCoyMnzA11‐x‐y‐zO2 (x > 0.85) powders were provided by LG Energy Solution. The powder X‐ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern of pristine Li6CoO4 was measured via in‐house XRD instrument (D8 Advance, Bruker) in the 2θ range of 15°–60° with a step size of 0.02° and step time of 3 s. Particles and electrode images were collected by FESEM (Apreo 2 S Hivac, Thermofisher Scientific) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. For electrode distribution analysis using FESEM, electrode samples were prepared using the ion‐milling system (IM4000, Hitachi) with 6 kV accelerating voltage at 60° for 30 min at the Research Institute of Advanced Materials, Seoul National University.

Pristine Li6CoO4 powder, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and Super P (TIMCAL) in the ratio of 97.5:1:1.5 wt.% were homogeneously dispersed in N‐methyl‐pyrrolidone (Acros Organics, 99%) in a planetary mixer (Thinky) at 2000 rpm for 15 min. The positive electrode composite was casted on an aluminum current collector with the thickness of 80 µm using a doctor blade and left to dry for 12 h under dry air condition of 80 °C. The areal loading of composite was 1.2 mg cm−2 after completely drying, and electrodes were pressed to 45 µm by calendaring. To prepare electrodes in varying densities of overlithiated materials, Li6CoO4 was replaced with NCMA in different weight percentage while maintaining the areal loadings and thickness of electrode. All electrodes were transferred to an argon‐filled glovebox ([O2] <1 ppm, [H2O] <0.1 ppm) for storage and assembly of any types of electrochemical cells used in experiments. 2032‐type coin cells were assembled with 12 mm positive electrode, 17 mm separator, 14 mm lithium metal counter electrode, and 1M LiPF6 EC/DMC (1:1 volume ratio). For all electrochemical tests, a galvanostatic cycling was performed at a rate of 40 mAg−1 to 4.3 V vs. Li/Li+, followed by a constant voltage step until the current reaches 10 mAg−1.

Operando Gas Analysis

Online differential mass spectrometry (HPR‐40, Hiden Analytical) was modified to accommodate gas analysis on Li‐ion batteries. OEMS experiments were performed with lithium metal counter electrodes and positive electrodes at varying densities of overlithiated materials, implemented in a custom‐built OEMS cell platform. The volume of 1M LiPF6 EC/DMC (1:1 volume ratio) electrolyte added to the cell was maintained at 1 mL. Electrochemical data were obtained with VSP‐200, and signals from mass spectrometer were collected with Hiden analytical software. All OEMS experiments proceeded after 1 hour open‐circuit‐voltage to stabilize background signals from the OEMS instrument. For quantitative analysis of gas evolution, signals obtained from the mass spectrometry were quantified using the 3D calibration surface contour that was constructed based on signals and partial pressures of standard gases in various concentrations.

Operando X‐Ray Diffraction Anaylsis

Operando XRD experiments were performed using pouch cells. Pouch cells were ≈5cm by 8cm, and the components consisting of pouch cells were analogous to coin cell as specified. The pouch cells were assembled with a lithium metal counter electrode, glass fiber separator, and Li6CoO4 positive electrode with 1M LiPF6 EC/DMC (1:1 volume ratio) electrolyte. Operando XRD patterns were collected by an in‐house XRD instrument (D8 Advance, Bruker) in the 2θ range of 15°–60° with an average measurement interval of 2 min per images. Data reduction from 2D to 1D was performed with MATLAB, and the sample‐to‐detector distance was calibrated based on diffraction peaks from the aluminum current collector as the reference.

Post‐Mortem Characterization

For X‐ray absorption spectroscopy experiments, electrodes were retrieved after disassembling coin cells at 5 different states of charge during the cycle with specified galvanostatic protocol. Retrieved electrodes were thoroughly washed with DMC to remove any electrolyte components that possibly hinder the accurate measurements, and electrodes were vacuum‐sealed in aluminum pouches. The X‐ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) at Co K‐edge was measured at the 7D XAFS beamline of Pohang Light Source (PLS). The energy shift was calibrated based on the Co metal foil as the reference. After fitting the linear background in the pre‐edge and post‐edge regions and subtracting from each spectrum, the spectra were normalized using the Athena software.

1H NMR spectroscopy (Ascend 500, Bruker) was incorporated for the analysis on byproducts formed in the electrolyte during the electrochemical operation under varying concentration of overlithiated materials. After the coin cells with electrodes in varying densities of Li6CoO4 were cycled with a specified galvanostatic cycling protocol, glass fibers separators were retrieved from disassembled coin cells. Each of the four electrolyte samples cycled under varying concentration of overlithiated materials as well as a pristine reference sample were prepared by extracting electrolyte soaked in glass fiber separators. Each 1H NMR spectra was acquired at 500 MHz frequency with 1024 scans, and dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the internal standard solvent for quantification of byproducts in the liquid phase.
