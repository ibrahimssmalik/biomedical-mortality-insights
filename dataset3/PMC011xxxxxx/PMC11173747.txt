==== Body
pmc Error in Figure

In the original publication [1], there was a mistake in “Scheme 1. Reaction mechanisms of LVA hydrodeoxygenation to GVL” as published. There is a technical mistake in the formula of γ-valerolactone.

Please see the corrected version below of Scheme 1.

Text Correction

There was an error included in the original publication. There was a mistake in the stated solvent.

A correction has been made to 3. Experimental Part, 3.3. Impregnation of Coal Fly Ash Zeolite with Ni, Co and Cu, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.

The monometallic fly ash zeolites were prepared by the following procedures: 10 wt.% Ni: 550 mg Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 1 mL distilled water and was added to 1 g zeolite support by stirring until evaporation of the solvent. Then, the sample was dried at 80 °C for 18 h and calcined at 450 °C for 3 h with a rate of 1 °C/min. The sample was denoted as 10Ni/Z; 10 wt.% Co: 548.2 mg Co(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 1 mL distilled water and was added to 1 g AES0 support by stirring until evaporation of the solvent. Then, the sample was dried at 80 °C for 18 h and calcined at 450 °C for 3 h with a rate of 1 °C/min. The sample was denoted as 10Co/Z; 10 wt.% Cu: 516.4 mg Cu(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 1 mL distilled water and was added to 1 g zeolite support by stirring until evaporation of the solvent. Then, the sample was dried at 80 °C for 18 h and calcined at 450 °C for 3 h with a rate of 1 °C/min. The sample was denoted as 10Cu/Z.

Bimetallic, 5 or 10 wt.% Ni- and Co-modified fly ash zeolite was prepared by the following procedures: 275/550 mg Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 274.1/548.2 mg Co(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in 1 mL distilled water was added to 1 g fly ash zeolite sample and then was dried at 80 °C for 18 h. The precursor salts were decomposed in air at 450 °C with a rate of 1 °C/min for 3 h. The samples were denoted as 5Ni5Co/Z and 10Ni10Co/Z, respectively.

Bimetallic, 5 or 10 wt.% Ni- and Cu-modified fly ash zeolite was prepared by the following procedures: 275/550 mg Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 258.2/516 mg Cu(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in 1 mL distilled water was added to 1 g zeolite and then was dried at 80 °C for 18 h. The precursor salts were decomposed in air at 450 °C with a rate of 1 °C/min for 3 h. The samples were denoted as 5Ni5Cu/Z and 10Ni10Cu/Z, respectively.

The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated.
