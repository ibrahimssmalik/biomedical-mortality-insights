Sensory hair cells of the inner ear utilize specialized ribbon synapses to transmit sensory stimuli to the central nervous system. This sensory transmission necessitates rapid and sustained neurotransmitter release, which relies on a large pool of synaptic vesicles at the hair-cell presynapse. Work in neurons has shown that kinesin motor proteins traffic synaptic material along microtubules to the presynapse, but how new synaptic material reaches the presynapse in hair cells is not known. We show that the kinesin motor protein Kif1a and an intact microtubule network are necessary to enrich synaptic vesicles at the presynapse in hair cells. We use genetics and pharmacology to disrupt Kif1a function and impair microtubule networks in hair cells of the zebrafish lateral-line system. We find that these manipulations decrease synaptic-vesicle populations at the presynapse in hair cells. Using electron microscopy, along with in vivo calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we show that a diminished supply of synaptic vesicles adversely affects ribbon-synapse function. Kif1a mutants exhibit dramatic reductions in spontaneous vesicle release and evoked postsynaptic calcium responses. Additionally, we find that kif1a mutants exhibit impaired rheotaxis, a behavior reliant on the ability of hair cells in the lateral line to respond to sustained flow stimuli. Overall, our results demonstrate that Kif1a-based microtubule transport is critical to enrich synaptic vesicles at the active zone in hair cells, a process that is vital for proper ribbon-synapse function.

Sensory hair cells in the inner ear rely on specialized ribbon synapses to encode auditory and vestibular stimuli. During stimulation, ribbon synapses are capable of releasing synaptic vesicles at high rates with exquisite precision over long durations (Nouvian et al., 2006; Mukhopadhyay & Pangrsic, 2022). The morphology of the presynaptic active zone (AZ) of ribbon synapses is specifically designed to sustain these release properties. Additionally, hair cells also have efficient mechanisms to recycle synaptic vesicles in order to sustain release (Wichmann & Moser, 2015; Pangrsic & Vogl, 2018). Disrupting presynapse morphology or vesicle recycling disrupts ribbon-synapse function and can lead to hearing and balance impairments (Trapani et al., 2009; Jing et al., 2013; Kroll et al., 2019; Wan et al., 2019). While considerable work has focused on the importance of synaptic vesicle recycling, less is known about how new synaptic material is made and transported to the presynaptic AZ in hair cells.

Hair cells convert sensory stimuli into electrical impulses to transmit to the brain. Sensory stimuli deflect cilia-like hair bundles at the apex of the cell, opening mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels and depolarizing the cell in a graded manner (Gillespie & Walker, 2001). Cell depolarization activates voltage-gated Cav1.3 channels at the presynaptic AZ at the base of the hair cell (Brandt et al., 2003). Calcium influx through Cav1.3 channels leads to synaptic-vesicle fusion and glutamate release onto the afferent neuron. Hair cells exhibit rapid and sustained neurotransmission in part due to a specialized presynaptic structure known as the synaptic ribbon (Moser et al., 2006; Matthews & Fuchs, 2010). The synaptic ribbon is an electron-dense structure that anchors synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic AZ, readying them for release. Ribbon synapses have been shown to be indefatigable, with rapid vesicle replenishment allowing for sustained release (Griesinger et al., 2005; Holt et al., 2004). But how hair cells supply sufficient synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic AZ to sustain synapse function is not fully understood.

Synaptic vesicle recycling, through endocytosis and local recycling of synaptic materials at the presynapse, has been shown to be critical to maintain synapse function in neurons and hair cells (Neef et al., 2014; Gallimore et al., 2023). But in neurons, numerous studies have also outlined the importance of de novo transport of synaptic material from the cell soma to presynaptic terminals (Santos et al., 2009; Rizzoli, 2014). In the soma of neurons, new synaptic material is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and then packaged and sorted in Golgi. This material leaves the Golgi as synaptic cargos that are transported along axons via microtubule highways and kinesin motor proteins. Kinesins transport cargos, such as synaptic-vesicle precursors, towards the plus-end of microtubules. In neurons, the plus-end of microtubules in axonal nerve processes are oriented towards the presynapse; thus kinesin-mediated transport delivers synaptic cargos to the presynapse (Guedes-Dias & Holzbaur, 2019). KIF1A, a member of the kinesin-3 family, has been shown to play a conserved role in transporting synaptic-vesicle precursors to neuronal presynapses across multiple species (Yonekawa et al., 1998; Zhao et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2001; Pack-Chung et al., 2007; Rizalar et al., 2021). In neurons axons can be extremely long, and cargos must be transported considerable distances to reach the presynapse. In contrast, hair cells are compact, polarized epithelial cells. In hair cells the Golgi is located on top of the nucleus, and the presynaptic AZ is just below the nucleus (Figure 1D, (Siegel & Brownell, 1986)). Recent work has demonstrated that hair-cell microtubules grow their plus ends from the cell apex, past the Golgi, and toward the presynaptic AZ (Hussain et al., 2024; Voorn et al., 2024). Additionally, immunostaining and scRNAseq data have shown that Kif1a is present in hair cells (Michanski et al., 2019; Sur et al., 2023). However, whether Kif1a or a microtubule network is required for proper transport of synaptic-vesicle precursors to the presynaptic AZ in hair cells remains unknown.

To study the role of Kif1a and microtubules in synaptic-vesicle transport in hair cells, we examined hair cells in larval zebrafish. In zebrafish, hair cells are found in the inner ear and in the lateral-line system, which are responsible for hearing and balance, and detection of local water flow, respectively (Figure 1A, (Nicolson, 2005; Sheets et al., 2021)). In larval zebrafish, the inner ear is composed of 5 sensory organs (3 crista and 2 maculae), while the lateral line is made up of clusters of hair cells called neuromasts that form in lines along the fish. Both of these sensory systems develop rapidly in zebrafish and are mature when larvae are only 5 days post fertilization (dpf) (Zeddies & Fay, 2005; Bhandiwad et al., 2013). Importantly, hair cells in the larval zebrafish are morphologically, genetically, and functionally similar to mammalian hair cells, and many of the core synaptic molecules are conserved between zebrafish and mammals. For example, in both mammals and zebrafish: Ribeye makes up the majority of the ribbon density, Vglut3 is the vesicular glutamate transporter required to uptake glutamate into synaptic vesicles, and calcium influx through Cav1.3 channels triggers vesicle fusion (Figure 1E; (Sidi et al., 2004; Obholzer et al., 2008; Lv et al., 2016)). The lateral-line system has proved particularly advantageous to study hair-cell synapses due to the superficial location of neuromasts along the body and the transparency of zebrafish at larval stages. Previous research using both fixed and live imaging approaches in lateral-line organs of larval zebrafish has shown that synaptic vesicles are highly enriched at the base of lateral-line hair cells (Figure 1C, (Obholzer et al., 2008; Einhorn et al., 2012)). In addition, there are powerful transgenic lines to visualize ribbon synapses or monitor ribbon-synapse activity in vivo using genetically-encoded indicators (Zhang et al., 2018). To complement this functional imaging, established electrophysiological approaches make it possible to measure vesicle fusion by recording spikes from the afferent neurons that innervate lateral-line neuromasts (Trapani & Nicolson, 2011). Together, these experimental advantages and tools make zebrafish an excellent model to study the role of synaptic-vesicle transport at ribbon synapses in hair cells.

Our study identifies Kif1a as a kinesin motor protein important for transporting and ultimately enriching synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic AZ in hair cells. We show that while both zebrafish ohnologues (paralogous sequences that result from complete genome duplication) of mammalian Kif1a, kif1aa and kif1ab, are expressed in inner-ear hair cells, only kif1aa is expressed in lateral-line hair cells. We find that kif1aa mutants are unable to enrich synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic AZ of lateral-line hair cells. Likewise, wild-type zebrafish exhibit the same loss of synaptic-vesicle enrichment when microtubules are destabilized. Functionally, we show that kif1aa mutants have normal evoked presynaptic-calcium responses, but that postsynaptic-calcium responses in afferent neurons are dramatically reduced. Further, the spontaneous spike rate of lateral-line afferent neurons is dramatically decreased in kif1aa mutants. Behaviorally, we find that kif1aa mutants have impaired station holding behavior during rheotaxis-a behavior that depends on a functional lateral-line system. Overall, our work demonstrates that a Kif1a-based mechanism is essential to enrich synaptic vesicles at ribbon synapses in hair cells. This enrichment is essential for ribbon-synapse function and ultimately for sensory behavior.

Results

Kif1aa is expressed in lateral-line hair cells and impacts ribbon-synapse counts

Work in neurons has demonstrated that Kif1a is an anterograde kinesin motor that transports synaptic-vesicle precursors towards the plus ends of microtubules (Okada et al., 1995). Recent work in both mouse and zebrafish hair cells has demonstrated that microtubules are polarized, with their plus ends growing toward the cell base, near the presynaptic AZ (Figure 1B; (Hussain et al., 2024; Voorn et al., 2024)). Further, RNAseq data indicates robust levels of Kif1a transcripts in mouse auditory hair cells and zebrafish hair cells (Lush et al., 2019; Kolla et al., 2020; Sur et al., 2023). Based on work in neurons, we used zebrafish to test whether Kif1a is a kinesin motor involved in the transport of synaptic vesicles to ribbon synapses in hair cells.

In zebrafish, there are two ohnologues of mammalian Kif1a, kif1aa and kif1ab (Figure 1I). Kif1aa and Kif1ab proteins show a high degree of identity to each other (89 %, NCBI BLAST) and to human KIF1A (84 and 85 % identity respectively, NCBI BLAST). Recent scRNAseq work has detected widespread expression of both kif1aa and kif1ab transcripts throughout the zebrafish nervous system (Sur et al., 2023). Similarly, widespread expression of Kif1a in the nervous system of mice is also well-documented (Okada et al., 1995). We used high-resolution RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) to verify whether the kif1aa and kif1ab mRNAs are present in zebrafish hair cells (Choi et al., 2018). We found that only kif1aa mRNA was present in hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line (Figure 1F-H). In contrast, both kif1aa and kif1ab mRNA were present in the hair cells of the zebrafish inner ear (Figure 1-S1). In the inner ear we observed both kif1aa and kif1ab mRNA in the cristae (which detects angular acceleration), the anterior macula (which detects gravity and is required for balance), and the posterior macula (which primarily detects auditory stimuli) (Fay & Popper, 2000).

After validating that Kif1a ohnologues are indeed expressed in hair cells, we leveraged zebrafish genetics to test whether Kif1a plays a role in the transport of synaptic vesicles in hair cells. We focused our efforts on a germline kif1aa mutant we created in a previous study (Hussain et al., 2024). This mutant has a stop codon in the Kif1aa motor domain and is predicted to be a null mutation (Figure 1I). This mutant should impair Kif1a in lateral-line hair cells but leave Kif1a function at least partially intact in the inner ear and the nervous system, due to the expression of the ohnologue kif1ab. We found via RNA-FISH that kif1aa mRNA expression was reduced by ~60 % in lateral-line hair cells in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 1-S2, control: 403.3 ± 65.8 puncta; kif1aa: 172.7 ± 48.6 puncta, n = 18 control and 16 kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p < 0.0001). Overall, this reduction in mRNA levels provides evidence that we have disrupted the kif1aa locus and that there is significant nonsense-mediated degradation of kif1aa mRNA in the lateral-line hair cells of kif1aa mutants.

Before assessing synaptic vesicles in kif1aa mutant hair cells, we first performed a gross assessment of lateral-line neuromasts using immunohistochemistry to label hair cells and ribbon synapses (Figure 2A-B). We performed our analyses at 5 dpf, when the majority of the hair cells are mature, and the lateral-line system is functional. We used antibodies against Myosin7a (Myo7a) to label hair cells, along with Ribeye b (Rib b) and Membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) to label the pre- and postsynapses respectively. We found that kif1aa mutants have a similar number of hair cells per neuromast compared to sibling controls (Figure 2C, control: 15.6 ± 1.3; kif1aa: 16.0 ± 1.7, n = 18 control and 15 kif1aa neuromasts; unpaired t-test, p = 0.399). For our synapse analysis we examined 2D maximum intensity projections and quantified the number and area of ribbons and postsynapses. Similar to our previous work on developing hair cells (3 dpf), we found that there were significantly fewer complete synapses (paired Rib b-MAGUK puncta) per hair cell in mature lateral-line hair cells (5 dpf) in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 2D, control: 3.13 ± 0.35; kif1aa: 2.68 ± 0.14, n = 18 control and kif1aa 15 neuromasts; unpaired t-test, p = 0.00870). Quantification of pre- and post-synapse size at complete synapses revealed no difference in presynapse size, but slightly larger postsynapses in kif1aa mutants compared to controls (Figure 2E, presynapse area, control: 0.21 ± 0.02; kif1aa: 0.20 ± 0.02, unpaired t-test, p = 0.345; Figure 2F, postsynapse area, control: 0.19 ± 0.02; kif1aa: 0.20 ± 0.02, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0498). Overall, we found that Kif1a ohnologues are present in hair cells in zebrafish. In the lateral-line, loss of Kif1aa does not alter hair-cell counts but does result in slightly fewer ribbon synapses.

Kif1aa is essential for synaptic-vesicle distribution in hair cells

Our overall assessment suggests that in kif1a mutants, ribbon synapses are largely intact, although fewer in number. As previous work in neurons has shown that Kif1a transports synaptic-vesicle precursors to the presynaptic AZ, we assessed whether loss of Kif1aa impacts synaptic-vesicle distribution at the presynapse in hair cells. We imaged both live and fixed preparations to visualize synaptic-vesicle distributions in hair cells of kif1aa mutants. To label synaptic vesicles live, we used the vital dye LysoTracker. This dye has been shown to label acidified organelles, including synaptic vesicles in lateral-line hair cells (Einhorn et al., 2012). To label synaptic vesicles in fixed samples, we used immunohistochemistry to label Vglut3, the vesicular glutamate transporter that labels synaptic vesicles in hair cells of zebrafish and mice (Obholzer et al., 2008; Schraven et al., 2012)

In line with previous work, we observed an enrichment of LysoTracker dye at the cell base near the presynaptic AZ in sibling controls (Figure 3A,C; (Einhorn et al., 2012)). In contrast, we did not observe enrichment of LysoTracker at the base of hair cells in kif1aa mutants (Figure 3B,C). To quantify Lysotracker enrichment, we measured the base to apex ratio of fluorescence in individual hair cells (Figure 3C). Using this metric, we found that kif1aa mutants enrich significantly less LysoTracker at the cell base (Figure 3D, control: 7.38 ± 1.16; kif1aa: 0.52 ± 0.16 n = 10 control and kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p<0.0001). Interestingly, we observed that the base to apex ratio was less than 1 in Kif1aa-deficient hair cells. This indicates that the LysoTracker label is more enriched in the hair-cell apex in kif1aa mutants.

Similar to LysoTracker label, and consistent with previous work in lateral-line hair cells, we observed that Vglut3 immunolabel was enriched at the cell base in sibling controls (Figure 3E,G; (Obholzer et al., 2008)). This enrichment was not observed in kif1aa mutants (Figure 3F,G). We quantified enrichment by measuring the base to apex ratio of Vglut3 immunolabel. We found that the base to apex ratio of Vglut3 label was significantly reduced in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 3H, control: 2.24 ± 0.65; kif1aa: 0.45 ± 0.07; n = 12 control and 13 kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p<0.0001).

To further verify that kif1aa mutants fail to enrich synaptic vesicles at the base of lateral-line hair cells, we used immunohistochemistry to label Rab3a and Cysteine string protein (CSP) (Figure 3-S1A-C and E-G). Rab3a and CSP are synaptic-vesicle markers that have also been shown to be enriched at the base of lateral-line hair cells (Einhorn et al., 2012; Kindt & Sheets, 2018). We measured the base to apex ratio of Rab3a and CSP immunolabels to quantify synaptic-vesicle enrichment. We observed that similar to our Vglut3 immunolabel, the base to apex ratio of both Rab3a and CSP immunolabels were significantly reduced in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 3-S1D, CSP, control: 1.86 ± 0.34; kif1aa: 0.58 ± 0.07; n = 10 control and kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p<0.0001 and Figure 3-S1H, Rab3a, control: 1.57 ± 0.30; kif1aa: 0.63 ± 0.15; n = 9 control and kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p<0.0001).

In addition to lateral-line hair cells, we also examined synaptic-vesicle distribution in inner-ear hair cells in kif1aa mutants. For our analysis, we focused on Vglut3 labeling, as Vglut3 has been shown to be essential for both inner ear and lateral-line function in zebrafish (Obholzer et al., 2008). First, we examined Vglut3 distribution in cristae. Interestingly, in sibling controls, we observed that Vglut3 label was only enriched in a subset of the hair cells (Figure 3-S2A, blue outlines). Previous work has shown that zebrafish cristae have two main hair-cell types that can be distinguished morphologically as “tall” and “short” hair cells (Zhu et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020). In sibling controls, we found that the tall cells enriched Vglut3 at the cell base. Compared to tall cells, short cells had nearly undetectable levels of Vglut3 (Figure 3-S2A, yellow outlines). A difference in Vglut3 immunolabel has also been observed between hair-cell types in mouse vestibular hair cells where type 2 but not type 1 vestibular hair cells express Vglut3 (Schraven et al., 2012). Importantly, when we examined kif1aa mutants we found that tall cells fail to enrich Vglut3 immunolabel at the cell base (Figure 3-S2B, blue outlines). This observation in kif1aa mutants indicates that kif1ab mRNA in cristae is not sufficient for normal Vglut3 enrichment in kif1aa mutants (Figure 1-S1B). In addition to cristae, we also examined Vglut3 immunolabel in the anterior and posterior macula. Unlike in the cristae, we found that in sibling controls all macular hair cells had detectable amounts of Vglut3 immunolabel and showed enrichment of Vglut3 at the cell base (Figure 3-S2C). In general, Vglut3 immunolabel was qualitatively lower yet still enriched at the cell base in the macular hair cells of kif1aa mutants (Figure 3-S2D). This indicates that Kif1aa is not essential for normal synaptic-vesicle distribution in macular hair cells.

Overall, our live and fixed imaging of synaptic-vesicle distribution in kif1aa mutants indicates that Kif1aa is essential to enriching synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic AZ of lateral-line hair cells and specifically in tall cells of the cristae. In contrast, loss of Kif1aa has a more moderate impact on synaptic-vesicle distribution in macular hair cells.

An intact microtubule network is essential for synaptic-vesicle distribution

Kif1a is known to transport synaptic-vesicle precursors towards the plus ends of microtubules. Therefore, we employed a pharmacological approach to understand the role that an intact microtubule network plays in synaptic-vesicle distribution in lateral-line hair cells. Nocodazole has been shown to block the self-assembly of tubulin and depolymerize preassembled microtubules (Samson et al., 1979). In addition, recent work has shown that treatment with 250–500 nM nocodazole can disrupt microtubule networks in developing lateral-line hair cells (Hussain et al., 2024). We found that incubating 5 dpf larvae in 250 nM nocodazole for 2 hrs disrupted microtubules in mature hair cells without any detectable hair-cell death (Figure 4-S1). We used nocodazole along with LysoTracker label or Vglut3 immunolabel to assess the impact of microtubule disruption on synaptic-vesicle distribution.

After incubation with 250 nM nocodazole, we observed less basal enrichment of Lysotracker compared to DMSO controls (Figure 4A-C). To quantify label enrichment, we measured the base to apex ratio of Lysotracker fluorescence in hair cells (Figure 4C-D). We found significantly less basal enrichment of Lysotracker in nocodazole-treated hair cells compared to DMSO controls (Figure 4D, control: 6.12 ± 0.93; nocodazole: 1.25 ± 0.40 n = 8 control and nocodazole neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p<0.0001). In addition, we found significantly less basal enrichment of Vglut3 in hair cells in nocodazole-treated larvae compared to DMSO controls (Figure 4H-E, control: 5.75 ± 1.61; nocodazole: 2.53 ± 0.65; n = 8 control and nocodazole neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p<0.0001). Together, our nocodazole treatments indicate that an intact microtubule network and functional Kif1aa are necessary to localize synaptic vesicles at the presynapse in lateral-line hair cells.

Kif1aa is important to maintain synaptic vesicles at ribbon synapses

Our live and fixed confocal imaging strongly suggests that synaptic vesicles fail to enrich at the cell base in kif1aa mutants (Figure 3, Figure 3-S1, S2). To understand how synaptic vesicles are impacted specifically at sites of release we examined synaptic vesicles at individual ribbons in lateral-line hair cells. We first examined our LysoTracker label more closely at individual ribbons. To detect ribbons within the LysoTracker label, we used a transgenic line that labels ribbons Tg(myo6b:Rib a-TagRFP). In addition to LysoTracker measurements, we also used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize individual synaptic vesicles at ribbons.

In control hair cells, we observed an intense LysoTracker label or halo surrounding individual ribbons (Figure 5A-B). This halo likely represents the population of synaptic vesicles tethered to the ribbon and is comparable to previous observations in lateral-line hair cells (Einhorn et al, 2012). We quantified the amount of LysoTracker in ROIs directly on individual ribbons. We measured Lysotracker intensity in a single place that encompassed the center of the ribbon. Using this approach, we found that the amount of Lysotracker at individual ribbons was significantly reduced in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 5C, control: 2582 ± 450; kif1aa: 1810 ± 650, n = 18 control and kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0003). This indicates that there is less Lysotracker label and likely fewer synaptic vesicles at ribbons in kif1aa mutants.

To quantify synaptic vesicles more definitively, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize ribbons in lateral-line hair cells. We only examined micrographs that contained images of a centrally sectioned ribbon adjacent to a well-defined postsynaptic density (Figure 5D-H). We quantified three main populations of synaptic vesicles localized in the vicinity of ribbons. We define these populations as following: 1) “vesicles tethered to the ribbon”; 2) “ready releasable vesicles” located directly beneath the ribbon; and 3) “reserve pool of vesicles” residing within 200 nm of the ribbon (Figure 5E, zones shaded in blue and orange, and a yellow dashed line) (Lenzi et al., 1999; Nouvian et al., 2006). We found that all three of these synaptic-vesicle populations were reduced in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 5I, readily releasable, control: 7 ± 1.8; kif1aa: 3.7 ± 2.0, unpaired t-test, p<0.0001; Figure 5J, tethered, control: 21.1 ± 3.5; kif1aa: 13.4 ± 5.3, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0001; Figure 5K, reserve pool, control: 36.3 ± 23.0; kif1aa: 9.7 ± 5.9, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0005). Our TEM quantification of synaptic vesicles is consistent with our LysoTracker labeling at ribbons, indicating that LysoTracker can be a quantifiable way to measure synaptic vesicles at ribbons using confocal microscopy. Overall, using both of these methods, we find that synaptic vesicles are depleted at ribbons in kif1aa mutants.

Loss of Kif1aa does not impact mechanosensitive or presynaptic calcium responses

Our results indicate that loss of Kif1aa in lateral-line hair cells dramatically decrease synaptic vesicle localization at the hair-cell base and at ribbon synapses (Figures 3, 5 and Figure 3-S1). But what impact this impairment in localization has on synaptic-vesicle release at ribbon synapses was unclear. Before examining vesicle release, performed several control experiments in kif1aa mutants and sibling controls.

Prior to assessing vesicle release in lateral-line hair cells, we first examined the localization of voltage-dependent calcium channels (CaV1.3). CaV1.3 channel localization can impact presynaptic calcium responses as well as both spontaneous and evoked vesicle fusion (Brandt et al., 2005; Trapani & Nicolson, 2011). In addition, calcium channels have been shown to be transported in synaptic precursor vesicles (Petzoldt, 2023). We used immunohistochemistry to examine CaV1.3 clusters and Rib b to label ribbons (Figure 6A-B). For our analyses we examined maximum intensity projections and quantified the number of puncta, along with the 2D area, average intensity, and integrated density of CaV1.3 puncta. We first quantified the number of paired CaV1.3-Rib b puncta and found that there were significantly fewer paired puncta per hair cell in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 6C, control: 4.13 ± 0.39; kif1aa: 3.59 ± 0.41; n = 13 control and 9 kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.00550). Fewer paired CaV1.3-Rib b puncta per cell is consistent with an overall reduction in the number of complete synapses per cell we observed in kif1aa mutants (Figure 2D). Looking more closely at CaV1.3 puncta, we did not observe a significant difference in the average size of CaV1.3 puncta between sibling controls and kif1aa mutants (Figure 6D, control: 0.14 μm2 ± 0.02; kif1aa: 0.15 μm2 ± 0.02; n = 13 control and 9 kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0953). However, both the mean intensity and integrated intensity of CaV1.3 puncta were significantly higher in kif1aa mutants compared to controls (Figure 6E, mean intensity, control: 1685 ± 459; kif1aa: 2961 ± 1002, unpaired t-test, p = 0.000600; Figure 6F, integrated intensity, control: 229.0 ± 73.6; kif1aa: 444.1 ± 180.2, unpaired t-test, p = 0.000900; n = 13 control and 9 kif1aa neuromasts). Together, our CaV1.3 immunolabeling experiments indicate that although there are fewer paired CaV1.3-Rib b puncta in kif1aa mutants, on average more CaV1.3 channels may reside within each CaV1.3 puncta.

After examining CaV1.3 channel localization at ribbon synapses we also did control experiments to assess hair-cell function. We first examined mechanosensation and presynaptic calcium responses. These are two activity-dependent events in hair cells that are required to drive synaptic vesicle fusion at ribbon synapses. To assess hair-cell mechanosensation we used two independent methods: FM 1–43 labeling and calcium imaging. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the vital dye FM 1–43 is a straightforward way to assess whether hair cells have intact mechanotransduction channels (Gale et al., 2001; Meyers et al., 2003). When applied to the media zebrafish are housed in, FM 1–43 enters mechanotransduction channels in lateral-line hair cells in seconds (Seiler & Nicolson, 1999). In contrast, mutants lacking mechanotransduction fail to label with FM 1–43. When we applied FM 1–43 to kif1aa mutants we found similar intensities of label compared to sibling controls (Figure 7-S1A-C, control: 2182 ± 227.1; kif1aa: 2034 ± 302.8, n = 8 control and 9 kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.276). Normal FM 1–43 label in kif1aa mutants indicates that mechanosensation is largely intact.

To obtain a more sensitive readout of hair-cell mechanosensation we used stimulus-evoked calcium imaging. We stimulated lateral-line hair cells with a fluid jet to evoke activity (Figure 7A) and read out calcium activity using a transgenic line that expresses membrane-localized GCaMP6s specifically in hair cells (myo6b:memGCaMP6s) (Lukasz & Kindt, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). This transgenic line can be used to image mechanosensation-dependent calcium signals in apical hair bundles, as well as calcium signals at the base of the cell that are associated with presynaptic-calcium influx (Figure 7A-B,D). We first examined calcium signals in apical hair bundles. In response to a 500-ms stimulus, we observed similar response magnitudes (AF/F GCaMP6s) in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 7B,D,F,G, control: 86.1 ± 24.2; kif1aa: 78.9 ± 18.7, n = 8 control and kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.514). Together our FM 1–43 labeling and calcium imaging experiments indicate that mechanosensation is intact in lateral-line hair cells of kif1aa mutants.

After assessing mechanosensation, we used the same transgenic line (myo6b:memGCaMP6s) and stimulation approach to examine presynaptic calcium responses at the hair-cell base. In responses to a 500-ms stimulus, we observed similar presynaptic-response magnitudes (ΔF/F GCaMP6s) in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 7C,E,H,I, control: 121.7 ± 57.6; kif1aa: 124.1 ± 51.5, n = 8 control and kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.930). Overall, our data indicate that both mechanosensitive and presynaptic responses in lateral-line hair cells are largely normal in kif1aa mutants.

Loss of Kif1aa alters spontaneous release and postsynaptic calcium responses

Our initial calcium imaging experiments suggests that presynaptic responses in kif1aa mutants are relatively normal (Figure 7C). Because kif1aa mutants fail to enrich synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic AZ, we hypothesized that vesicle release could still be impaired despite normal presynaptic-calcium responses. Therefore, we used additional functional approaches to examine the postsynaptic outcome of fewer synaptic vesicles.

Similar to hair cells in other species, zebrafish lateral-line hair cells release glutamate-filled synaptic vesicles at rest. Established work has shown that this release generates spontaneous spikes in neurons of the posterior lateral-line ganglion (pLLg)-neurons that innervate posterior lateral-line neuromasts (Figure 1A, (Trapani & Nicolson, 2011)). We used loose-patch electrophysiology recordings to measure spontaneous spikes in pLLg neurons (Figure 8A). To quantify the rate of spontaneous spiking, we measured the number of spikes per minute over a 5-min window. We observed a marked ~80 % decrease in the average afferent spike rate in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (Figure 8B-C, control: 207.5 ± 148.3, kif1aa: 42.03 ± 19.70; n = 8 control and 13 kif1aa cells, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0007). This indicates that a reduction in synaptic vesicles at the presynapse in kif1aa mutants results in fewer vesicles released at rest.

To assess evoked postsynaptic activity, we used calcium imaging. For our imaging, we used a transgenic line that expresses GCaMP6s specifically in neurons in the pLLg (en.sill,hsp70l:GCaMP6s) (Zhang et al., 2018). We stimulated hair cells with a fluid jet and used this line to measure evoked calcium signals in the afferent terminal beneath lateral-line hair cells (Figure 8D-F). In responses to a 500-ms stimulus, we observed that postsynaptic calcium responses (ΔF/F GCaMP6s) in kif1aa mutants were dramatically reduced compared to sibling controls (Figure 8E-H, control: 82.6 ± 27.9; kif1aa: 27.2 ± 24.7, n = 10 control and 9 kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0003). Together, our postsynaptic electrophysiology and calcium imaging indicate that loss of Kif1aa and fewer synaptic vesicles leads to impaired release of synaptic vesicles.

Kif1aa is required for normal rheotaxis behavior, but not acoustic startle behavior

After verifying that loss of Kif1aa impaired synapse function in lateral-line hair cells, we assessed what impact this impairment had on behavior. We examined two hair-cell mediated behaviors in zebrafish: the acoustic startle response and rheotaxis. The acoustic startle response is well-characterized zebrafish behavior where a rapid escape reflex occurs in response to an acoustic or vibrational stimulus (Kimmel et al., 1974; Granato et al., 1996). This behavior relies primarily on hair cells in the posterior macula (saccule), as well as hair cells in the lateral line (Granato et al., 1996; Holmgren et al., 2021). Rheotaxis, whereby fish orient into an oncoming current and hold their position to avoid being swept downstream, is a multisensory behavior where the lateral-line organ is used to sense changes in water flow (Coombs et al., 2020). Loss of lateral-line function in larval zebrafish leads to an inability to station hold (i.e., hold position at the source of oncoming water flow) during bouts of rheotaxis behavior (Newton et al., 2023).

To assay the acoustic startle response in our kif1aa mutants we used a Zantiks automated behavioral system. We presented larvae in a 12-well plate with acoustic vibrational stimuli of 3 levels of intensity (level 3 highest, level 1 lowest), with 5 trials per intensity level. Each trial was done with a 2-min inter-stimulus interval (ISI) to avoid habituation. Using Zantiks software, larvae were recorded and tracked throughout the experiment (Figure 9-S1A-B). We found that our kif1aa mutants were able to respond to a single non-habituating stimulus at the same rate as sibling controls at each stimulus intensity level (Figure 9-S1C, n = 38 control and 13 kif1aa larvae, 2-way ANOVA, level 3: p = 0.999, level 2: p = 0.999, level 1: p = 0.994, no stimulus: p = 0.586, 5 dpf). Because we saw no difference in kif1aa mutants in our acoustic startle assay, we decided to push this assay further to see if our mutants could maintain responses when presented with repeated or habituating stimuli with short ISIs. For this assay we first administered 3 non-habituating stimuli with a 2-minute ISI, followed by a train of 30 habituating stimuli with a 5-second ISI. We also tested recovery from habituation; here we administered one stimulus at 20 s, 40 s, 1 min, and 2 min each after the last habituating stimulus. Using this paradigm, we found that kif1aa mutants habituate at the same rate as sibling controls (Figure 9-S1D, n = 38 control and 25 kif1aa larvae, 2-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons, across stimulus and genotype, p = 0.545). In addition, the rate of recovery after habituation was not significantly different between kif1aa mutants and sibling controls (Figure 9-S1D, n = 38 control and 25 kif1aa larvae, 2-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons, across stimulus and genotype, p = 0.620). Overall, our acoustic startle assays indicate that loss of Kif1aa does not impair this escape reflex.

Our immunostaining demonstrated that synaptic-vesicle enrichment was less affected in hair cells of the inner ear in kif1aa mutants (Figure 3-S2). This may allow inner ear hair cells in kif1aa mutants to function normally, as the acoustic startle is a fast reflex and may not require sustained synaptic vesicle release. Therefore, we examined rheotaxis behavior, a hair-cell mediated behavior that is reliant on lateral-line hair cells, as synaptic vesicle populations in these hair cells were dramatically impaired in kif1aa mutants. To evaluate rheotaxis behavior, we used a custom microflume to present laminar flow to zebrafish at 6 dpf, at a rate of ~10 mm s−1 (Figure 9A; (Baker & Montgomery, 1999; Newton et al., 2023)). We recorded the behavior of larvae with an overhead camera 10 s before flow (pre-stimulus) and for 20 s during flow stimulus using infrared (850 nm) illumination to eliminate visual cues. We measured spatial use of the chamber, distance traveled, and rheotaxis events (orienting in flow) during flow. We first we examined the spatial use of the flow chamber, we found that when performing rheotaxis, wild-type siblings were predominantly positioned in the space at the front of the arena, in the region of the highest flow (Figure 9B; white dashed box). In contrast, kif1aa mutants cumulatively show less positioning in high-flow regions, indicating a reduced ability to station hold (Figure 9B). During bouts of rheotaxis, we also observed that kif1aa mutants accumulated along the side of the arena in a small lateral gradient in the laminar flow field (Figure 9B; orange dashed box). Together, these observations indicate that kif1aa mutants have an impaired ability to maintain position during rheotaxis. To determine why kif1aa mutants showed a reduced station holding, we evaluated whether there were differences in the metrics of rheotaxis behavior for the first (0–10 s) and last half (10–20 s) of stimulus. When we examined distance traveled during rheotaxis, we found that during the last half of the stimulus, kif1aa mutants traveled a reduced total distance compared to wild-type siblings (Figure 9C, 0–10 s, control: 43.33, kif1aa: 37.26, p = 0.532; 11–20 s, control: 50.08, kif1aa: 35.07, p = 0.0728, n = 43 controls and 30 kif1aa larvae). Importantly, we did not observe a difference in total distance traveled before the onset of flow, indicating that motor function is largely intact in kif1aa mutants (Figure 9C). Further, we observed a trend toward fewer rheotaxis events in kif1aa mutants during the last half of stimulus, though it did not reach significance (Figure 9D, 0–10 s, control: 3.21, kif1aa: 3.03, p = 0.532; 1120 s, control: 4.53, kif1aa: 3.70, p = 0.0728, n = 43 controls and 30 kif1aa larvae).

Taken together, our acoustic startle and rheotaxis assays demonstrate that while kif1aa mutants can respond normally to discrete acoustic stimuli, their ability to effectively station hold during rheotaxis behavior in sustained flow stimuli is impaired. This suggests that a large population of synaptic vesicles is important for behaviors that require sustained neurotransmission.

Discussion

Our work in zebrafish demonstrates that both Kif1a and an intact microtubule network are essential to localize synaptic vesicles properly at the presynaptic AZ. Our functional assays reveal that hair cells lacking Kif1a release fewer synaptic vesicles, leading to impaired afferent responses. Importantly, deficits in hair-cell vesicle release results in impaired station-holding during rheotaxis–a behavior mediated by the lateral-line sensory system. Altogether, our work highlights a new pathway that ensures an adequate supply of synaptic vesicles reaches the cell base to maintain high rates of release at specialized ribbon synapses.

Accessory machinery and cargo in transport vesicles

Our work demonstrates that lateral-line hair cells lacking Kif1aa have less enrichment of synaptic markers (Figure 3, Figure 3-S1) and fewer synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic AZ (Figure 5). This finding is consistent with studies in neurons in both mice and C. elegans where disruptions in Kif1aa orthologues Kif1a/UNC-104 result in significantly fewer synaptic vesicles at presynapses (Hall & Hedgecock, 1991; Okada et al., 1995). In neurons, synaptic-vesicle precursors are made de novo in the ER-Golgi network located in the cell soma. After budding from the trans-Golgi, these precursors are carried to presynaptic terminals along axonal microtubules via kinesin motors and mature into synaptic vesicles at the presynapse (Santos et al., 2009; Rizzoli, 2014). Precursor vesicles can contain many presynaptic components including: Rab3a, CSP, Vglut, Piccolo, Bassoon, SNARE proteins, Neurexins and calcium channels (reviewed in: (Petzoldt, 2023)). In our kif1aa mutants we show that several of these cargos such as Rab3a, CSP, and Vglut3 fail to localize properly at the presynaptic AZ in hair cells (Figures 3, Figure 3-S1). Although we did observe more CaV1.3 channels per presynapse (Figure 6F), we also observed fewer complete synapses (Figure 2D) and fewer Rib b-CaV1.3 paired puncta (Figure 6C) in kif1aa mutants. Fewer complete pairings could be due to a requirement for Kif1aa to transport material (ex: Ribeye and CaV1.3) during synapse formation. This is consistent with our previous work that revealed subtle defects in ribbon formation in lateral-line hair cells lacking Kif1aa (Hussain et al., 2024). Overall, our work on hair cells suggests that Kif1a plays a conserved role in the transport of synaptic material to the presynaptic AZ of neurons and hair cells.

An important part of transport is not only the kinesin motor moving cargo along microtubules, but also adaptors that link specific cargos to motors. Work in neurons suggests that the Kif1a motor relies on the adaptor protein MAP kinase activating death domain (Madd) to transport synaptic vesicle precursors. Specifically, Madd is thought to provide a linkage between Rab3a present on synaptic-vesicle precursors and Kif1a (Niwa et al., 2008; Hummel & Hoogenraad, 2021). In our study, and other work on hair cells, Rab3a has been shown to be a marker of synaptic vesicles in hair cells (Uthaiah & Hudspeth, 2010; Einhorn et al., 2012). Along with other synaptic markers, we found that in kif1aa mutants, Rab3a immunolabel was not enriched at the hair-cell presynapse (Figure 3-S1E-H). Based on this result and work in neurons, it is possible that Rab3a is part of the link that is required to facilitate the transport of new synaptic-vesicle precursors from the Golgi in hair cells. In the future it will be interesting to examine the localization of various synaptic vesicle markers in rab3a mutants or to lesion other transport partners such as Madd to determine whether they are also required to accumulate synaptic vesicles at the presynapse in hair cells.

Mechanisms to maintain synaptic vesicle populations at the presynapse

We found that fewer synaptic vesicles in kif1aa mutants were accompanied by impaired spontaneous and evoked activity in lateral-line afferent neurons (Figure 3, Figure 5, Figure 8). But despite a dramatic reduction in synaptic vesicles and activity, some synaptic vesicles were still present at ribbon synapses and activity was not completely abolished (Figures 5, Figure 8). Based on these results it is likely that there are alternate mechanisms in play that ensure synaptic vesicles reach the presynapse. For example, other kinesin motors could work in tandem with Kif1a to transport synaptic vesicle precursors. In support of this idea, immunolabeling results have shown that another kinesin, Kif3a, colocalizes with ribbons (Michanski et al., 2019). Alternatively, it is possible that synaptic-vesicle precursors may simply reach the presynapse through diffusion. Studies on ribbon synapses suggest that synaptic vesicles are able to freely diffuse within the cytosol until affixing to the ribbon (Holt et al., 2004; LoGiudice & Matthews, 2009). Based on these diffusion studies, it is possible that synaptic and precursor vesicles in kif1aa mutants diffuse from their site of origin near the Golgi until they eventually encounter and bind to a ribbon. In this scenario, although diffusion is less efficient than directed transport, it may allow enrichment of enough synaptic vesicles to explain the residual function at synapses in kif1aa mutants.

In many types of neurons, especially those with long axons, it is essential that new synaptic-vesicle precursors are actively transported, as presynaptic terminals are located at considerable distances from the cell soma. In these circumstances, the diffusion of synaptic-vesicle precursors is not practical. In addition to de novo synthesis and transport of synaptic material from the Golgi to the presynapse, at both neuronal synapses and ribbon synapses, endocytosis and local synaptic vesicle recycling also function to maintain synapse function. For example, work in hippocampal neurons has demonstrated that robust recycling of synaptic vesicles can maintain stable and consistent synaptic release even during high frequency and sustained stimulation (Gallimore et al., 2023). In hair cells, multiple forms of endocytosis have been characterized at ribbon synapses including clathrin-mediated endocytosis and bulk endocytosis; there is also evidence of kiss-and-run fast endocytosis (Neef et al., 2014). In the future, it will be important to more carefully explore whether endocytic pathways are disrupted in hair cells lacking Kif1aa.

While there are several pathways in hair cells capable of recycling synaptic material, it is less clear where this recycling occurs. For example, most of the recycling could occur locally at the presynaptic AZ. Synaptic material could also reenter the cell apically and be re-trafficked to the presynapse at the cell base. Additionally, it is possible that both apical and basal locations could be used for recycling synaptic material. Electron micrographs show evidence that both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and bulk endocytosis occur near the presynapse (Siegel & Brownell, 1986; Lenzi et al., 2002; Kamin et al., 2010). In addition, studies using FM 1–43 uptake to measure endocytosis in hair cells have shown that endocytosis may also occur more apically and undergo recycling in the Golgi (Griesinger et al., 2002, 2005). Endocytosis in hair cells has also been studied using the membrane tracer mCLING (Revelo et al., 2014). Work using mCLING revealed evidence that synaptic material is recycled apically, as well as basally at the presynapse via local recycling of synaptic vesicles and bulk endocytosis. Overall, it is likely that de novo synthesis and transport of synaptic material from the Golgi, bulk endocytosis, and local synaptic vesicle recycling all work together to supply synaptic vesicles for release at ribbon synapses. In the future it would be interesting to create transgenic zebrafish that label synaptic vesicles in hair cells. In vivo imaging of this transgenic line could be used to understand how synaptic vesicles are transported and recycled in living hair cells–and how these processes are perturbed in kif1aa mutants.

Impact of Kif1a loss on zebrafish behavior and in human patients

In humans mutations in the KIF1A gene lead to a rare inherited condition collectively known as KIF1A-associated neurological diseases (KANDs) (Nair et al., 2023). Because KIF1A is expressed broadly in the nervous system, there is extensive damage to neurons in the brain and spinal cord in KAND patients. Further, while optic nerve atrophy and vision impairment are also a part of KAND, hearing loss is a less well-studied symptom of this disease (Lee et al., 2015; Montenegro-Garreaud et al., 2020; Pennings et al., 2020). Our work suggests that in addition to neurons, KIF1a may also play an important role in sensory hair cells. Our study was able to highlight this role more clearly because zebrafish have two ohnologues of mammalian KIF1a, Kif1aa and Kif1ab (Figure 1I). Based on published scRNAseq data (Sur et al., 2023), in our kif1aa zebrafish mutants it is likely that Kif1ab compensates for loss of Kif1aa in most neurons. This allowed us to focus on phenotypes relevant to hair cells in the lateral line, which only express kif1aa (Figure 1F-H). Behaviorally, our kif1aa mutants have normal acoustic startle responses (Figure 9-S1). Normal startle behavior could be due to contributions from hair cells in the zebrafish inner ear which are less affected in our kif1aa mutants (Figure 3-S2). Alternatively, it is possible that fewer synaptic vesicles are needed for this reflexive behavior. Importantly, our rheotaxis experiments demonstrated that kif1aa mutants are unable to maintain position in flow (Figure 9B). Further, the deficits in rheotaxis behavior occurred during the last 10 s of stimulus (Figure 9C, D), suggesting that the inability to maintain synaptic vesicles at hair-cell presynapses may underlie these deficits. The continuous flow applied during our rheotaxis experiments demands a near constant supply of synaptic vesicles, specifically from lateral-line hair cells. In future studies, it will be important to rescue Kif1a in hair cells to ensure that our behavioral phenotypes are due to defects that arise specifically in hair cells.

Overall, our work suggests that inner ear deficits may contribute to phenotypes in human KAND patients. For example, KAND is associated with cerebellar ataxia, and although there is evidence of cerebellar atrophy in KAND patients, it is possible that there are also contributions from the inner ear, particularly the vestibular system where hair cells must maintain sustained release of synaptic vesicles for proper balance (Paprocka et al., 2023). In the future it will be important to assess KAND patients carefully for hearing and balance deficits. In addition, our kif1aa zebrafish could be used to understand the role KIF1a plays in hair cells or to assess pathogenic variants in KIF1a.

Our current study highlights how an understudied mechanism–Kif1a-based transport–functions to enrich synaptic vesicles at ribbon synapses in hair cells. In the future it will be important to understand how this transport works alongside recycling and endocytic pathways to supply the near constant demand for synaptic vesicles at ribbon synapses. A powerful way to study synaptic vesicle dynamics is by using live imaging and sensitive readouts of release, such as afferent recordings. The zebrafish lateral line provides an excellent model to apply these approaches in future studies.

Methods

Zebrafish husbandry

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) lines were maintained at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under animal study protocol #1362-13. Zebrafish larvae (0–7 dpf) were raised in incubators at 28°C in E3 embryo medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, and 0.33 mM MgSO4, buffered in HEPES, pH 7.2) with a 14hr:10hr light:dark cycle. Lines were maintained in a Tu or TL background.

For rheotaxis experiments embryos were shipped at 1 dpf from NIH to Washington University-St. Louis and maintained under IACUC protocol #23-0078, and subsequently, raised in incubators at 28°C in embryo media2 (15 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM KCl, 1 mMCaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.15 mM KH2PO4, 0.042 mM Na2HPO4, 0.714 mM NaHCO3) with a 14hr:10hr light:dark cycle. After 4 dpf, larvae were raised in 100–200 ml of EM in 250 ml plastic beakers and fed rotifers daily.

All experiments were performed on larvae at 3–6 days post fertilization (dpf). Neuromasts L1-L4 were used for all analyses, except the CaV1.3 immunolabel where L1-L4, D1 and O1 were examined, and our TEM analysis where cranial neuromasts M1, along with the POs, and SOs were examined. Larvae were chosen at random and used at an age where sex determination is not possible. The previously described mutant and transgenic lines were used in this study: kif1aaidc24, Tg(myo6b:memGCaMP6s)idc1Tg, Tg(en.sill,hsp70l:GCaMP6s)idc8Tg, Tg(myo6b:Cr. ChR2-EYFP)ahc1Tg, Tg(myo6b:ctbp2a-TagRFP)idc11Tg (also referred to as: Tg(myo6b:rib a-TagRFP)idc11Tg) and Tg(myo6b:YFP-Hsa.TUBA)idc16Tg(Monesson-Olson et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2019; Ohta et al., 2020; Hussain et al., 2024)

The kif1aa germline mutant has been previously described (Hussain et al., 2024). This Crispr-Cas9 mutant has a complex INDEL that leads to a disruption in Kif1aa at amino acid 166, in exon 6, within the kinesin motor domain (Figure 1I). This INDEL also disrupt a Bsl1 restriction site in exon 6. Genotyping was done using standard PCR followed by a Bsl 1 restriction enzyme digest. Kif1aa genotyping primers used were as follows: kif1aa_FWD 5’-AACACCAAGCTGACCAGTGC-3’ and kif1aa_REV 5’-TGCGGTCCTAGGCTTACAAT-3’. Kif1aa mutants were compared to either heterozygous and wild-type siblings (sibling controls) or to wild-type siblings as stated in the text.

Nocodazole treatment

To destabilize microtubules, Tg(myo6b:YFP-Hsa.TUBA)idc16Tg larvae at 5 dpf were incubated in 250 nM nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich, SML1665) for 2 hours. Nocodazole was diluted in E3 media for a final concentration of 250 nM nocodazole and 0.1 % DMSO. After effective nocodazole treatment YFP-Hsa.TUBA labeling was visually disrupted. For controls, larvae were incubated in media containing 0.1 % DMSO. After 2 hours, larvae were fixed for immunohistochemistry or prepared for LysoTracker labeling (see below).

Lysotracker labeling, and imaging

After 2 hours of nocodazole treatment, 100 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (ThermoFisher, L7528) was added to the media for 15 min. Larvae were then embedded in 1 % low melt agarose prepared in E3 media containing 0.03 % tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, A5040, ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt), 100 nM LysoTracker and either 250 nM nocodazole or 0.1 % DMSO. A similar labeling approach was used for Lysotracker labeling in kif1aa mutants. LysoTracker Red DND-99 was used to label Tg(myo6b:YFP-Hsa.TUBA)ldc16T9 larvae while LysoTracker Green DND-26 (ThermoFisher, L7526) was used to label Tg(myo6b:rib a-TagRFP)ldc11Tg larvae. Transgenic larvae were incubated in 100 nM LysoTracker dye in E3 media for 15 min and mounted in 1 % low melt agarose prepared in E3 media containing 0.03 % tricaine and 100 nM Lysotracker dye.

To image LysoTracker label, samples were imaged live on a Nikon A1R upright confocal microscope using a 60× 1 NA water objective lens. Denoised images were acquired using NIS Elements AR 5.20.02 with an 0.425 μm z-interval. Z-stacks of whole or partial neuromasts were acquired in a top-down configuration using 488 and 561 nm lasers.

FM 1–43 labeling, imaging and analysis

To assay mechanotransduction using FM 1–43, larvae at 5 dpf were incubated in 3 μM FM 1–43 (Thermofisher, T3163) in E3 media for 35 s. Larvae were then washed 3* in E3 and mounted in 1 % low melt agarose prepared in E3 media with 0.03 % tricaine. After mounting larvae were imaged on a Nikon A1R upright microscope using a 60× 1 NA water objective lens. Denoised images were acquired using NIS Elements AR 5.20.02 with an 0.425 μm z-interval. Z-stacks of whole neuromasts were acquired in a top-down configuration using 488 and 561 nm lasers. Z-stacks were further processed in FIJI. Z-stacks were max-projected and thresholded to obtain the mean intensity of the FM 1–43 label per neuromast.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry was performed on whole larvae. Zebrafish larvae were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3–4 hrs at 4 °C. After fixation samples were washed 5 * 5 min in PBS + 0.01 % Tween (PBST), followed by a 5-min wash in H2O. Larvae were then permeabilized with ice cold acetone (at −20 °C) for 5 min. Larvae were then washed again in H2O for 5 min, followed by a 5 * 5-min washes in PBST, and then blocked overnight at 4 °C with PBST containing 2 % goat serum, 2 % fish skin gelatin and 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA). Primary antibodies were diluted in PBST containing 1 % BSA. Larvae were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After 5 * 5 min washes in PBST to remove the primary antibodies, larvae were incubated in diluted secondary antibodies (1:1000) in PBST containing 1 % BSA for 3 hrs at room temperature. After 5 * 5 min washes in PBST to remove the secondary antibodies, larvae were rinsed in H2O and mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade (ThermoFisher, P36930).

RNA-FISH to detect kif1aa and kif1ab mRNA in hair cells

To detect mRNA for kif1aa and kif1ab we followed the Molecular Instrument RNA-FISH Zebrafish protocol, Revision Number 10 (https://files.molecularinstruments.com/MI-Protocol-RNAFISH-Zebrafish-Rev10.pdf), with a few minor changes to the preparation of fixed whole-mount larvae as follows. For our dehydration steps we dehydrated using the following methanol series: 25, 50, 75, 100, 100 % methanol, with 5 min for each step in the series. To permeabilize we treated larvae with 10 μg/mL proteinase K for 20 min. RNA-FISH probes were designed to bind after the motor domain of zebrafish kif1aa and kif1ab (Figure 1I, Molecular Instrument Probe lot # RTD364, RTD365, using B2 and B3 amplifiers respectively). Tg(myo6b:Cr.ChR2-EYFP)ahc1Tg larvae were labeled using these probes; the strong EYFP label is retained after RNA-FISH and allows for delineation of hair cells within the whole-mount larvae. After the RNA-FISH protocol the larvae were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade (ThermoFisher, P36930).

Confocal imaging of RNA-FISH and immunolabels

Fixed immunostained and RNA-FISH samples were imaged on an inverted LSM 780 laser-scanning confocal microscope with an Airyscan attachment using Zen Blue 3.4 (Carl Zeiss) and an 63× 1.4 NA Plan Apo oil immersion objective lens. Neuromast and inner ear z-stacks were acquired every 0.15 μm. The Airyscan z-stacks were auto processed in 3D. Experiments were imaged with the same acquisition settings to maintain consistency between comparisons. For presentation in figures, images were further processed using Fiji.

Quantification of RNA-FISH and synaptic components

Z-stack image acquisitions from zebrafish confocal images were processed in FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012). Researchers were blinded to genotype during analyses. Hair-cell numbers were counted manually based on Myo7a, Cr.ChR2-EYFP, YFP-Hsa.TUBA or Acetylated tubulin label. Each channel was background subtracted using the rolling-ball radius method. Then each z-stack was max-intensity projected. A mask was generated by manually outlining the region or interest in the reference channel (ex: hair cells via Myo7a, Acetylated tubulin or Tg(myo6b:Cr.ChR2-EYFP)). This mask was then applied to the z-projection of each synaptic component or RNA-FISH channel.

We then used automated quantification to quantify puncta using a customized Fiji-based macro previously described (Jukic et al., 2024). In this macro, each masked image was thresholded using an adaptive thresholding plugin by Qingzong TSENG (https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/adaptivethreshold) to generate a binary image of the puncta (presynaptic, postsynaptic, CaV1.3 cluster or RNA-FISH puncta). Individual synaptic or RNA-FISH puncta were then segmented using the particles analysis function in Fiji. A watershed was applied to the particle analysis result to break apart overlapping puncta. After the watershed, the particle analysis was rerun with size and circularity thresholds to generate ROIs and measurements of each punctum. For particle analysis, the minimum size thresholds of 0.025 μm2 (Rib b, CaV1.3, kif1aa and kif1ab RNA-FISH particles) and 0.04 μm2 (Maguk) were applied. A circularity factor of 0.1 was also used for the particle analysis. The new ROIs were applied to the original z-projection to get the average intensity and area of each punctum.

To identify paired synaptic components, images were further processed. Here, the overlap and proximity of ROIs from different channels (ex: pre- and post-synaptic puncta) were calculated. ROIs with positive overlap or ROIs within 2 pixels were counted as paired components. The ROIs and synaptic component measurements (average intensity, area) and pairing results were then saved as Fiji ROIs, jpg images, and csv files.

Synaptic vesicle quantification of live and fixed labels

Z-stack image acquisitions from live or fixed confocal images were processed and quantified in FIJI. A minimum of 3–6 hair cells per neuromast analyzed. Hair cells with a clear side view were used for base to apex analyses. For base to apex, two rectangular ROIs with an area of 2.25 × 0.65 μm (L x W), were placed above and below the nucleus of each hair cell, in 1 z-slice. Nuclei were identified based on Acetylated tubulin or YFP-Hsa.TUBA labeling. The mean values were measured in all ROIs. The ratio of the base to apex was measured per hair cell to assess the enrichment of synaptic vesicles. Ratio values for hair cells were then averaged for a single neuromast base to apex fluorescence value. To quantify Lysotracker fluorescence at ribbons, a circular ROI was drawn around the ribbon indicated by Rib a-mCherry fluorescence, and the mean value was measured in FIJI.

Startle behavior

A Zantiks MWP behavioral system was used to assess acoustic startle responses in larvae at 5 dpf as previously described (Giese et al., 2023; Jukic et al., 2024). The Zantiks system tracks and monitors behavioral responses using an infrared camera at 30 frames per second. During the tracking and stimulation, a Cisco router connected to the Zantiks system was used to relay x, y coordinates of each larva in every frame. A 12-well plate was used for behavioral analyses. Each well was filled with E3 and 1 larva. All fish were acclimated in the plate within the Zantiks chamber in the dark for 15 min before each test. A vibrational stimulus that triggered a maximal proportion of animals startling in control animals without any tracking artifacts (due to the vibration), was used for our strongest stimuli. We used 4 different levels of intensity (1–4, increasing in intensity), with level 4 as the highest intensity stimulus. For our initial startle assay, each larva was presented with stimuli from intensity levels 1–3, 5 times, with 100 s between trials. For each animal, the proportion of startle responses out of the 5 trials was plotted. For our habituation and recovery assay, a non-habituating stimulus, followed by a habituating stimulus train, and lastly recovery stimulus was performed as previously described (Marsden & Granato, 2015). Our non-habituating stimulus was presented 3 times (intensity level 4), with 100 s between trials. This was followed by a habituating train of 30 stimuli (same stimulus intensity), presented with 5 s in between each stimulus. We then presented recovery stimuli once each at 20 s, 40 s, 1 min, and 2 min after the last stimulus in the habituating train. The proportion of startle responses out of the initial 3 non-habituating stimuli and the proportion of responses at each habituation block and recovery stimulus were plotted. To qualify as a startle response, a distance above 4 pixels or ~1.9 mm was required within 2 frames after stimulus onset. Larvae were excluded from our analysis if no tracking data was recorded. Startle behavior was performed on at least three independent days.

Rheotaxis behavior

A custom microflume (previously described in: (Newton et al., 2023)) was used as the experimental apparatus for rheotaxis behavior. Laminar water flow of a constant velocity was provided by a 6V bow thruster motor (#108-01, Raboesch) inserted into the flume. An Arduino (UNO R3, Osepp) was programmed with custom scripts to coordinate the timing of the flow and video recording. An array of 196 LEDs emitting infrared light (850 nm) provided illumination for video capture through a layer of diffusion material (several Kimwipes sealed in plastic) and the translucent bottom of the flume. A monochromatic high-speed camera (SC1 without IR filter, Edgertronic.com) with a 60 mm manual focus macro lens (Nikon) was used to record behavioral trials at 60 fps. The flume was filled with EM media (28 °C) and the arena placed within the flume. Due to the heat generated by the IR lights, the temperature was monitored and miniature ice packs (2 × 2 cm; −20 °C) were used to maintain a consistent temperature range of 27–29 °C. For each rheotaxis behavior test, individual 6 dpf larval zebrafish were transferred by pipette to the arena within the flume and their swimming activity was monitored for ~10 s to ensure that it exhibited burst-and-glide swimming behavior; larva that did not exhibit normal swimming behavior during the pre-trial period were not included in the analysis. Each larva was genotyped after behavior acquisition and analysis. A total of 43 wild-type siblings and 30 kif1aa mutant larvae were analyzed. Rheotaxis behavior was assessed blind, prior to genotyping. Data was collected from 6 experimental sessions on separate days.

Larval fish were tracked using DeepLabCut as previously described (Newton et al., 2023). In brief, video files were downsampled to 1000 × 1000 px and cropped. A previously created and trained single animal maDLC project was used to annotate seven unique body parts (left and right eyes, swim bladder, four points along the tail) on each larva. Videos were analyzed with the maDLC project, and the detections were assembled into tracklets using the box method. The original videos were overlaid with the newly labeled body parts to check for trackelet accuracy. Misaligned tracklets were manually adjusted. Rheotaxis behavior was annotated and analyzed using a previously created custom Python feature extraction script (SimBA) that defined positive rheotaxis events as when the larvae swam into the oncoming water flow at an angle of 0 degrees ± 45 degrees for at least 100 ms. Videos processed through DeepLabCut analysis were converted to AVI format using the SimBA video editor function and imported into SimBA as previously described.

Calcium imaging and electrophysiology

Larvae for electrophysiology recordings were either in a Tg(myo6b:Cr.ChR2-EYFP) transgenic background or a nontransgenic background. For calcium imaging either Tg(myo6b:memGCaMP6s)idc1Tg or Tg(en.sill,hsp70l:GCaMP6s)idc8Tg transgenic larvae were used. To prepare larvae for calcium imaging and electrophysiology, 3–6 dpf larvae were anesthetized in 0.03 % Tricaine-S (SYNCAINE/MS-222, Syndel), pinned to a Sylgard-filled perfusion chamber at the head and tail. Then larvae were paralyzed by injection of 125 μM α-bungarotoxin (Tocris, 2133) into the heart cavity, as previously described (Lukasz & Kindt, 2018). Larvae were then rinsed once in E3 embryo media to remove the tricaine. Next, larvae were rinsed three times with extracellular imaging solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, OSM 310±10) and allowed to recover prior to calcium imaging or electrophysiology. Researchers were blind to genotype during the acquisition.

Calcium responses in the hair cells and afferent process were acquired on a Swept-field confocal system built on a Nikon FN1 upright microscope (Bruker) with a 60× 1.0 NA CFI Fluor water-immersion objective. The microscope was equipped with a Rolera EM-C2 EMCCD camera (QImaging), controlled using Prairie view 5.4 (Bruker). GCaMP6s was excited using a 488 nm solid state laser. We used a dual band-pass 488/561 nm filter set (59904-ET, Chroma). For evoked measurements, stimulation was achieved by a fluid jet, which consisted of a pressure clamp (HSPC-1, ALA Scientific) and a glass pipette (pulled and broken to achieve an inner diameter of ~50 μm) filled with extracellular imaging solution. A 2-s or 500-ms pulse of positive or negative pressure was used to deflect the hair bundles of mechanosensitive hair cells along the anterior-posterior axis of the fish. For GCaMP6s imaging in hair bundles or at the presynapse the Tg(myo6b:memGCaMP6s)idc1Tg line was used. For GCaMP6s imaging in the afferent terminal beneath lateral line hair cell, the Tg(en.sill,hsp70l:GCaMP6s)idc8Tg line was used. GCaMP6s measurements were performed on larvae at 4 and 5 dpf. Each neuromast (L1-L4) was stimulated four times with an inter-stimulus interval of ~2 min. To acquire GCaMP6s evoked responses, 5 z-slices (0.5 μm step for mechanosensation, 1.5 μm step for presynaptic and 2.0 μm step for the afferent process) were collected per timepoint for 80 timepoints at a frame rate of 20 ms for a total of ~100 ms per z-stack and a total acquisition time of ~8 sec. Stimulation began at timepoint 31; timing of the stimulus was triggered by an outgoing voltage signal from Prairie view.

GCaMP6s z-stacks were average projected, registered, and spatially smoothed with a Gaussian filter (size = 3, sigma = 2) in custom-written MatLab software as described previously (Zhang et al., 2018). The first 10 timepoints (~1 sec) were removed to reduce the effect of initial photobleaching. Registered average projections analyzed in Fiji to make intensity measurements using the Time Series Analyzer V3 plugin. Here circular ROIs were placed on hair bundles or synaptic sites; average intensity measurements over time were measured for each ROI, as described previously (Lukasz & Kindt, 2018). GCaMP6s data was excluded in the case of excessive motion artifacts. Presynaptic responses were defined as >20% ΔF/F0. Hair-bundle responses were defined as >20% ΔF/F0. Postsynaptic responses were defined as >5% ΔF/F0 and a minimum duration of 500 ms. Calcium imaging data then plotted in Prism 10 (Graphpad). The first 20 timepoints were averaged to generate an F0 value, and all responses were calculated as ΔF/F0. The Area under the curve (AUC) function of Prism was used to determine the peak value for each response. Responses presented in figures represent average responses within a neuromast. The max ΔF/F0 was compared between sibling and kif1aa mutants.

Extracellular postsynaptic current recordings from afferent cell bodies of the posterior lateral-line ganglion (pLLg) of zebrafish at 3–6 dpf were performed as previously described (Trapani & Nicolson, 2011; Lukasz et al., 2022). Briefly, borosilicate glass pipettes (Sutter Instruments, BF150-86-10 glass with filament) were pulled with a long taper, with resistances between 5 and 15 MΩ. The pLLg was visualized using an Olympus BX51WI fixed stage microscope equipped with a LumPlanFl/IR 60× 1.4 NA water dipping objective (N2667800, Olympus). An Axopatch 200B amplifier, a Digidata 1400A data acquisition system, and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, LLC) were used to collect signals. To record spontaneous extracellular currents, afferent cell bodies were recorded using a loose-patch configuration with seal resistances ranging from 20 to 80 MΩ. Recordings were done in voltage-clamp mode, and signals were sampled at 50 μs/point and filtered at 1 kHz. The number of spontaneous events from one neuron per min was quantified from a 5-min recording window using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics).

Transmission electron microscopy

Larvae were genotyped at 2 dpf using a larval fin clip method to identify kif1aa and wild-type siblings to prepare for TEM (Wilkinson et al., 2013). Larval tail DNA was genotyped as described above. At 5 dpf kif1aa and wild-type siblings were fixed in freshly prepared solution containing 1.6 % paraformaldehyde and 2.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer supplemented with 3.4% sucrose and 2 μM CaCl2 for 2 h at room temperature, followed by a 24-h incubation at 4 °C in a fresh portion of the same fixative. After fixation, larvae were washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer with supplements, and post-fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide for 30 min, and then washed with distilled water. Larvae were, dehydrated in 30 – 100 % ethanol series, which included overnight incubation in 70 % ethanol containing 2% uranyl acetate, and in propylene oxide, and then embedded in Epon. Transverse serial sections (60–70 nm thin sections) were used to section through neuromasts. Sections were placed on single slot grids coated with carbon and formvar, and then sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All reagents and supplies for TEM were from (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Samples were imaged on a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope (JEOL Inc.). Whenever possible, serial sections were used to restrict our analysis to central sections of ribbons adjacent to the plasma membrane and a well-defined postsynaptic density.

To quantify ribbon area, ROIs were drawn in FIJI outlining the electron-dense ribbon, excluding the filamentous “halo” surrounding the ribbon. Vesicles with a diameter of 30–50 nm and adjacent (within 60 nm of the ribbon) to the “halo” were counted as tethered vesicles. Readily releasable vesicles were defined as tethered vesicles between the ribbon and the plasma membrane. To quantify reserve vesicles, we counted vesicles that were not tethered to the ribbon but were within 200 nm of the edge of the ribbon. All distances and perimeters were measured in FIJI.

Statistics

All data shown are mean and standard deviation unless stated otherwise. All replicates were biological-distinct animals and cells. Wild-type zebrafish animals were selected at random for drug treatments. Kif1aa mutants were compared to sibling controls which were either wild-type siblings or a combination of wild-type and or kif1aa heterozygous siblings obtained from the same clutch. All experiments were performed blind to genotype. In all datasets dot plots represent the ‘n’. N represents either the number of neuromasts, hair cells, synapses or puncta as stated in the legends. All experiments were replicated on multiple independent days. For our zebrafish experiments a minimum of 3 animals and 8 neuromasts were examined. An exception is our TEM experiments where we examined ribbon synapses in 7 neuromasts from 4 wild-type siblings and 4 neuromasts from 3 kif1aa mutants. Sample sizes were selected to avoid Type 2 error. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 10 software (GraphPad) or in R for our rheotaxis assays. A D’Agostino-Pearson normality test was used to test for normal distributions. To test for statistical significance between two samples with normal distributions, an unpaired t-test was used. For acoustic startle assays, a 2-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons was used. A Sidak test was used to correct for multiple comparisons. For rheotaxis behavior: data wrangling, cleaning, and figure generation were performed with R and performed as previously described (Newton et al., 2022). The mean duration, number, total distance traveled, and mean latency to the onset of rheotaxis events were calculated for 10 s bins (pre-stimulus, first 10 s of stimulus, and last 10 s of stimulus) using SimBA and analyzed in R using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and post hoc t-tests (Satterthwaite method). Type III ANOVAs provided significance values for the fixed effects of the GLMMs (see Supplementary Tables 1,2). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. All error bars and ± are standard deviation, unless stated otherwise.

Figure 1. kif1aa is expressed in lateral-line hair cells in zebrafish.

(A) Schematic of a larval zebrafish at 5 dpf. Hair cells are present in the inner ear and lateral line (blue). Hair cells are innervated by neurons in the posterior lateral-line ganglion (pLLg) located near the inner ear (green). (B-C) The lateral line is composed of clusters of hair cells called neuromasts (5 dpf). The apex of hair cells project from the center of these clusters, while the ribbon synapses are located at the base of the cells. Neuromasts can be viewed from the top-down B or from the side C. An individual hair cell in B and C is outlined in yellow. Within hair cells, microtubule networks extend along the apical-basal axis (B). At the base of hair cells, synaptic vesicles (Vglut3 label, green) are enriched near the presynapse or ribbons (CTBP, magenta) (C). (D) Within hair cells the Golgi is located above the nucleus (gray oval, n in B-C). The Golgi is where synaptic-vesicle precursors are made de novo. Kinesin motors could be used to transport vesicles along microtubules to the cell base. (E) Synaptic vesicles surround the presynapse or ribbon in hair cells. Synaptic vesicles contain Rab3a, CSP and Vglut3. Beneath the ribbon CaV1.3 channels are clustered adjacent to the postsynaptic density (PSD). (F-H) RNA-FISH reveals that kif1aa (orange) but not kif1ab (cyan) mRNA is present in lateral-line hair cells (YFP, gray) at 5 dpf. (H-I) Overview of the Kif1aa and Kif1ab proteins and major domains (coiled coil (CC), fork-head associated (FHA), pleckstrin homology (PH)). The location of the germline kif1aa lesion in the kinesin motor domain within exon 6 is indicated. The red dashed line indicates the regions encompassed by the RNA-FISH probe. The scale bar in B, C and H = 5 μm.

Myosin7a (Myo7a) labels hair cells, Ribeye b (Rib b) labels ribbons or presynapses, and Maguk labels postsynapses. (C) The number of hair cells per neuromast is the same in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (control: 15.6 ± 1.3; kif1aa: 16.0 ± 1.7, unpaired t-test, p = 0.399). (D) Kif1aa mutants have fewer complete synapses per cell (control: 3.13 ± 0.35; kif1aa: 2.68 ± 0.56, unpaired t-test, p = 0.00870). (E) In kif1aa mutants the average area of Rib b puncta (presynaptic) was similar to sibling controls (control: 0.21 μm2 ± 0.023; kif1aa: 0.20 μm2 ± 0.02, unpaired t-test, p = 0.345). (F) In kif1aa mutants the average area of Maguk puncta (postsynaptic) was slightly larger compared to sibling controls (control: 0.19 μm2 ± 0.02; kif1aa: 0.20 μm2 ± 0.02, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0498). n = 18 control and 15 kif1aa neuromasts in C-F. Scale bar in A = 5 μm.

Scale bar in A and E = 5 μm and 2 μm in C and G.

Figure 5. Kif1a is important to maintain synaptic vesicles at ribbon synapses

(A-B) Example live images of neuromasts at 5 dpf in a kif1aa mutant (B) or sibling control (A) at 5 dpf. Synaptic vesicles are labeled with LysoTracker Green (green), and ribbons are labeled with Rib a-TagRFP (magenta). The yellow dashed lines in A and B were used to create the insets shown to the side. The top inset image shows the base of this single hair cell labeled with Lysotracker (green) and Rib a-TagRFP (magenta), while the bottom inset shows just LysoTracker (gray). Insets are only a partial projection (single cell) of the larger image. The yellow dashed circles indicated ROIs used to quantify LysoTracker intensity at ribbons. (C) The average LysoTracker intensity at ribbons is significantly lower in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (control: 2582 ± 450; kif1aa: 1810 ± 650, n = 17 control and kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0003). (D) Schematic of an individual hair cell with a ribbon (black dashed box) like ones examined for TEM. (E-H) Representative TEM images of ribbon synapses from kif1aa mutants (G-H) or wild-type sibling controls (E-F) at 5 dpf. In E “tethered vesicles” are in blue, “readily releasable vesicles” in orange, while “the reserve pool” within 200 nm of the ribbon is encompassed by the yellow dashed line. (I-K) All synaptic vesicle pools are reduced in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (I, readily releasable, control: 7 ± 1.8; kif1aa: 3.7 ± 2.0, unpaired t-test, p<0.0001; J, tethered, control: 21.1 ± 3.5; kif1aa: 13.4 ± 5.3, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0001; K, reserve pool, control: 36.3 ± 23.0; kif1aa: 9.7 ± 5.9, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0005). n = 14 control kif1aa ribbons in I-J, and n = 12 control and 13 kif1aa ribbons in K. Scale bar in A = 5 μm, inset is 0.1 μm, F = 250 nm.

Figure 6. There are fewer paired Cav1.3-Rib b puncta in kif1aa mutants

(A-B) Example immunostain of neuromasts at 5 dpf in kif1aa mutants (B) or sibling control (A). Ribeye b (Rib b) labels ribbons or presynapses, and CaV1.3 labels calcium channels. Insets to the side show high magnification images of individual synapses. (C) The number of paired Rib b-CaV1.3 puncta is significantly reduced in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling controls (control: 4.13 ± 0.39; kif1aa: 3.59 ± 0.41; n = 13 control and 9 kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.00550). (D) The average size of CaV1.3 puncta was similar between sibling controls and kif1aa mutants (control: 0.14 ± 0.02; kif1aa: 0.15 ± 0.02, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0953). (E-F) The mean intensity and integrated intensity of CaV1.3 puncta were significantly higher in kif1aa mutants compared to controls (E, mean intensity, control: 1685 ± 459; kif1aa: 2961 ± 1002, unpaired t-test, p = 0.000600; F, integrated intensity, control: 229.0 ± 73.6; kif1aa: 444.1 ± 180.2, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0009). n = 13 control and 9 kif1aa neuromasts in C-F. Scale bar in A = 5 μm, inset is 0.5 μm.

Figure 7. Kif1aa mutants have normal mechanosensitive and presynaptic responses.

(A) Overview of the scheme used to assess evoked calcium responses in lateral-line hair cells. A fluid-jet is used to deliver flow stimuli to lateral-line neuromasts. A membrane-localized GCaMP6s (myo6b:memGCaMP6s, green) expressed in hair cells is used to measure fluid-jet evoked calcium signals in apical hair bundles or presynaptic calcium signals at the cell base. (B-E) Top-down images show optical planes of memGCaMP6s in neuromast hair bundles (B,D) or at the presynapse (C,E). Heatmaps show spatial representations of Δ GCaMP signals during evoked mechanosensitive (B-C) and presynaptic (D-E) activity during a 500-ms stimulation (stim) compared to prestimulus (prestim) in sibling controls and kif1aa mutants. (F-I) Traces show the average mechanosensitive (F) and calcium presynaptic (H) calcium responses in sibling control and kif1aa mutant hair cells (n = 8 neuromasts). Dot plots show that the average mechanosensitive (G) and presynaptic (I) calcium responses are similar in sibling control and kif1aa mutant hair cells (G, control: 86.1 ± 24.2, kif1aa: 78.9 ± 18.7, n = 8 control and kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.514; I, control: 121.7 ± 57.6, kif1aa: 124.1 ± 51.5, n = 8 control and kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.930, 5 dpf). Scale bar in B-E = 5 μm.

Figure 8. Afferent neurons in kif1aa mutants have fewer spontaneous spikes and reduced evoked responses.

(A) Overview of the scheme used to record spontaneous spiking from afferent cell bodies in the posterior lateral-line ganglion (pLLg). Glass pipettes pulled with long tapers were used to record extracellularly in a loose-patch configuration. (B) Representative 10 s traces show spiking in pLLg neurons in sibling control (top) and kif1aa mutant (bottom). (C) Quantification shows that the average number of spikes per min in kif1aa mutants is significantly lower than sibling controls (control: 207.5 ± 148.3, kif1aa: 42.03 ± 19.70; n = 8 control and 13 kif1aa cells, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0007, 3–6 dpf). (D) Overview of the scheme used to assess evoked calcium responses in the afferent terminals beneath lateral-line hair cells. A fluid-jet is used to deliver flow stimuli to lateral-line neuromasts. A transgenic line (en.sill,hsp70l:GCaMP6s) expressed in posterior lateral-line afferents is used to measure fluid-jet evoked GCaMP6s calcium signals in afferent terminals beneath neuromasts. (E-F) Top-down images show optical planes of GCaMP6s in afferent terminals. Heatmaps show spatial representations of Δ GCaMP signals in afferent terminals during a 500-ms stimulation (stim) compared to prestimulus (prestim) in sibling control and kif1aa mutants. (G) Traces show the average response in the afferent terminal in sibling control and kif1aa mutants (n = 10 control and 9 kif1aa neuromasts). (H) Dot plot shows that the average response in the afferent terminal is significantly lower in kif1aa mutants compared to sibling control (control: 82.6 ± 27.9, kif1aa: 27.2 ± 24.7; n = 10 control and 9 kif1aa neuromasts, unpaired t-test, p = 0.0003, 4–5 dpf). Scale bar in E-F = 5 μm and 1 s in B.

Figure 9. Station holding within flow stimulus is impaired in kif1aa mutants.

(A) Top-down view of the working section of the microflume apparatus. Blue arrows indicate the direction of water flow. A larval fish performing behavior is included for scale. (B) Two-dimensional heat maps showing spatial use/cumulative positioning during flow stimulus. Wild-type siblings (B) predominantly maintain position in the space at the front of the arena (white dotted lines) in the strongest part of the flow. Cumulative positioning in the source of the flow is reduced for kif1aa mutants (white vs. orange dotted lines) indicating impaired ability to station hold. (C) Box and whisker plots of total distance traveled during rheotaxis events. Under flow stimulus, the total distance traveled by kif1aa mutant larvae was significantly reduced compared to wild-type siblings during the second half (11–20 s) of flow stimulus (control: 50.08 nm; kif1aa: 35.07 nm, adjusted p = 0.017 (11–20 s)). (D) Box and whisker plots of the mean number of rheotaxis events. Under flow stimulus, kif1aa mutant larvae trended toward fewer rheotaxis events during the last half (11–20 s) of stimulus, though the difference was not significant (control: 4.53 events; kif1aa: 3.70 events, adjusted p = 0.0728). n = 43 wild-type and 30 kif1aa mutant larvae were tested.

Key points:

Kif1a mRNAs are present in zebrafish hair cells

Loss of Kif1a disrupts the enrichment of synaptic vesicles at ribbon synapses

Disruption of microtubules depletes synaptic vesicles at ribbon synapses

Kif1a mutants have impaired ribbon-synapse and sensory-system function
