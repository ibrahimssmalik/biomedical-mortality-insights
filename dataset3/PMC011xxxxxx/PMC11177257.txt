Reactive functional groups, such as N-nitrosamines, impart unique bioactivities to the natural products in which they are found. Recent work has illuminated enzymatic N-nitrosation reactions in microbial natural product biosynthesis, motivating interest in discovering additional metabolites constructed using such reactivity. Here, we use a genome mining approach to identify over 400 cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding homologues of the N-nitrosating biosynthetic enzyme SznF, including the BGC for chalkophomycin, a CuII-binding metabolite that contains a C-type diazeniumdiolate and N-hydroxypyrrole. Characterizing chalkophomycin biosynthetic enzymes reveals previously unknown enzymes responsible for N-hydroxypyrrole biosynthesis, including the first prolyl-N-hydroxylase, and a key step in the assembly of the diazeniumdiolate-containing amino acid graminine. Discovery of this pathway enriches our understanding of the biosynthetic logic employed in constructing unusual heteroatom–heteroatom bond-containing functional groups, enabling future efforts in natural product discovery and biocatalysis.

Many natural product bioactivities are direct consequences of incorporating reactive functional groups. N-nitroso groups, for example, are precursors to DNA alkylating agents and generate reactive NO radicals.1−4 Recently, diazeniumdiolates (N-hydroxy-N-nitrosamines) have been identified as bidentate ligands in multiple metallophores.5−7 This plethora of functions has increased interest in N-nitroso natural products and in discovering biosynthetic enzymes that synthesize this and similarly reactive functional groups containing heteroatom–heteroatom bonds.8−12

The first dedicated N-nitrosating enzyme to be biochemically characterized, SznF, was identified in the biosynthesis of the FDA-approved cancer chemotherapeutic streptozotocin.13,14 This multidomain metalloenzyme catalyzes the oxidative rearrangement of a guanidine group to the N-nitrosourea pharmacophore of streptozotocin (Figures 1A and S1). The diiron-binding heme oxygenase-like diiron oxidase and oxygenase (HDO) domain of SznF converts l-Nω-methylarginine to l-Nδ-hydroxy-Nω-hydroxy-Nω′-methylarginine, and its nonheme mononuclear iron-containing cupin domain catalyzes a synthetically and biochemically unprecedented intramolecular rearrangement of this intermediate to afford the N-nitrosourea product.15,16 Prior to the discovery of SznF, characterized approaches for N-nitrosation in biology invoked nonenzymatic nitrosation of amines using nitrite; however, the evolution of a dedicated N-nitrosating enzyme suggests important biological roles for this functional group and raises questions about the distribution of this enzymatic chemistry.

Figure 1 Genome mining reveals numerous uncharacterized biosynthetic pathways that use putative N-nitrosating enzymes. (A) SznF is a nonheme iron-dependent oxygenase that catalyzes guanidine N-oxygenation and N-nitrosation in streptozotocin biosynthesis. Leveraging an understanding of SznF-catalyzed chemistry may inform the discovery of new N-nitrosating enzymes.

Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE) alignment was used to determine conservation of the metal-binding residues of SznF’s HDO (7 residues) and cupin (3 residues) domains. The node highlighting SznF represents the protein sequences from Streptomyces sp. di50b and S. sp. di188 (94% amino acid ID to query SznF sequence from Streptomyces achromogenes var. streptozoticus NRRL 2697). (D) Select examples from the MUSCLE alignment of all protein sequences derived from the seven largest clusters in the SSN. The position of metal-binding residues of the heme oxygenase-like diiron oxidase and oxygenase (HDO) domain and the cupin domain in SznF’s sequence are highlighted (bolded, gray) to convey the diversity in ligand conservation across BLAST hits.

Genome mining has been a successful strategy for discovering novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including several pathways that produce N–N bond-containing natural products. N-nitroso metabolite-producing BGCs discovered using this strategy include the gramibactin, megapolibactin, plantaribactin, and tistrellabactin BGCs, all of which produce diazeniumdiolate (N-hydroxy-N-nitroso)-containing metallophores.5,6,17 In each case, a gene encoding an SznF homologue that is believed to carry out N-nitrosation has been identified in the corresponding BGC; however, these enzymes have not been biochemically characterized. Previous work from our group demonstrated the wide distribution of SznF homologues in phylogenetically diverse bacteria.13 However, compared to the number of unique BGCs predicted to encode an N-nitrosating enzyme, very few N-nitroso-containing natural products have been isolated.

Here, we use genome mining to identify additional N-nitrosating enzyme-encoding BGCs, including the BGC that produces chalkophomycin, a CuII-binding metallophore that features the C-type diazeniumdiolate-containing amino acid graminine and a rare N-hydroxypyrrole heterocycle.7 We elucidate the biosynthetic origins of these unusual functional groups using stable isotope feeding experiments and further probe the enzymes responsible for their construction using in vitro biochemical characterization. We unexpectedly find that a heme-dependent enzyme participates in N-nitroso biosynthesis by generating l-dihydroxyarginine, akin to the role of SznF’s HDO domain, providing the first biochemical insights into the origins of graminine. We also characterize the enzymes responsible for biosynthesizing N-hydroxypyrrole from l-proline, uncovering a biosynthetic logic distinct from that used in the assembly of other functionalized pyrroles. Identifying the genetic and biochemical basis for N-hydroxypyrrole biosynthesis solves a longstanding mystery in the field, as the enzymes used to construct this structural motif have never been reported despite its presence in natural products being noted for decades. This knowledge has enabled us to identify additional cryptic BGCs that likely produce N-hydroxypyrroles, suggesting that this heterocycle may play important roles in many more uncharacterized natural products.

Results

Genome Mining Identifies the Chalkophomycin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster

To identify putative N-nitrosating enzymes encoded in uncharacterized BGCs, we performed iterative basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) searches of the Joint Genome Institute/Integrated Microbial Genomes (JGI/IMG) database using the full amino acid sequence of SznF (Figure 1B).18 We classified these proteins into putative isofunctional groups using a sequence similarity network (SSN) generated using the EFI-Enzyme Similarity Tool (Figure 1C).19 A large cluster of 118 sequences in the SSN contained enzymes previously implicated in diazeniumdiolate biosynthesis (GrbD, MegD, PlbJ, and MobE), although they have not yet been biochemically characterized. A second SSN cluster included SznF and 135 other proteins located in szn-type BGCs. Finally, a third prominent cluster in the SSN contained 48 uncharacterized proteins not yet known to perform N-nitrosation chemistry. The genes encoding these proteins are found in a variety of unique genomic contexts. Unlike sznF, but like grbD, these genes colocalize with genes encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) machinery. We therefore predicted that these enzymes biosynthesize distinct nonribosomal peptide and polyketide natural products featuring an N-nitroso functional group.

We next sought to assess the chemical capabilities of the SznF homologues in the SSN. A multiple sequence alignment of all 426 identified proteins was performed to examine conservation of the metal-binding residues in the HDO and cupin domains of SznF (Figure 1D). Intriguingly, among the sequences in the newly defined cluster of NRPS- and PKS-associated enzymes, all but one lack many of the iron-binding residues of the HDO domain but retain the three histidines of SznF’s N–N bond-forming cupin domain. This observation suggests these SznF homologues may lack N-oxygenating activity but might still catalyze N–N bond formation.

To further explore the biosynthetic roles of these enzymes, we selected the BGC from Streptomyces anulatus ATCC 11523 for further investigation due to the strain’s commercial availability and well-annotated genome (JGI/IMG Genome ID: 2873289101). An identical BGC is also encoded in the genome of Lentzea flaviverrucosa DSM 44664. Comparing the genomes of these two strains revealed the conservation of 17 consecutive genes that compose the BGC of interest (Figure 2A). Using a combination of gene annotations, conserved domain databases from NCBI and InterPro, and NRPS-PKS analysis databases (antiSMASH, University of Maryland NRPS Predictor, and PRISM)20−22 we generated a predicted structure for the encoded natural product to inform metabolite identification efforts (Tables S1 and S2). Although there was ambiguity surrounding substrate predictions for many of the biosynthetic enzymes, we deduced that in addition to an N-nitroso group, this metabolite likely contained features commonly found in metallophores, including a catechol or phenol as well as a thiazoline heterocycle (Table S2).

Figure 2 The chm gene cluster produces the metallophore chalkophomycin. (A) sznF homologue chmM is encoded within a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in the S. anulatus ATCC 11523 genome. (B) Heterologous expression of the chm gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 reveals chalkophomycin production. (C) Same mass feature, corresponding to chalkophomycin, can be observed in metabolomic samples of native chm-encoding organisms with the same m/z ratio and diagnostic Cu isotopic distribution pattern. Mass spectrum intensity was normalized to the height of 455 m/z ions in each sample.

We recognized a striking resemblance between elements of our predicted structure and chalkophomycin, a CuII-binding natural product from Streptomyces sp. CB00271 that was reported shortly after we had completed our genome mining effort.7 Notably, chalkophomycin contains an N-hydroxypyrrole in lieu of the predicted catechol or phenol, where N–OH serves as a metal-binding ligand. Chalkophomycin also has an oxazoline in place of the predicted thiazoline. Finally, the presence of a diazeniumdiolate in this natural product is consistent with a biosynthetic pathway that involves an SznF homologue. A BLAST search of the S. sp. CB00271 genome using SznF revealed a hit that shared 97% amino acid identity (aa ID) to the S. anulatus ATCC 11523 homologue, ChmM, encoded within an identical BGC. This provided strong support for the involvement of this cryptic gene cluster (which we termed the chm gene cluster) in chalkophomycin production.

To confirm this assignment, we heterologously expressed the chm gene cluster from S. anulatus ATCC 11523 in S. coelicolor M1152 (Figure 2B). S. coelicolor M1152 harboring the chm gene cluster (S. coelicolor pDualP-chm), but not the wild-type strain, produced chalkophomycin in R2B medium supplemented with 100 mg/L Cu(II)SO4·5H2O, confirmed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) with the exact mass and Cu-specific isotopic distribution pattern expected for this metabolite. When S. anulatus ATCC 11523 was cultured in the medium used for chalkophomycin isolation (M2 medium), chalkophomycin was detected via LC–MS. Additionally, L. flaviverrucosa DSM 44664 and several other strains possessing the chm gene cluster also produced chalkophomycin under the R2B + Cu(II) growth conditions (Figures 2C, S2, and S3). Apo-chalkophomycin was identified by LC–MS, and the MS/MS fragmentation pattern matches reported data (Figure S4).7 Therefore, heterologous expression of the chm BGC and metabolite profiling of native encoders unambiguously verified the link between this gene cluster and chalkophomycin.

We next sought to formulate an initial hypothesis for chalkophomycin biosynthesis and assign roles to individual Chm biosynthetic enzymes (Figure 3). We proposed a convergent biosynthesis that employs thiotemplated formation of N-hydroxypyrrole and l-graminine, the diazeniumdiolate-containing nonproteinogenic amino acid. In this report, we document the enzymatic transformations that afford the N-hydroxypyrrole building block and intermediates in the l-graminine synthesis. We hypothesized that the N-hydroxypyrrole is hydrolyzed from ChmI and reintroduced as the starter unit of the NRPS assembly line beginning with ChmL, after which the remaining amino acid substrates are incorporated into the growing natural product structure. ChmP adds a unit of malonyl-CoA, the last substrate required to produce the core chalkophomycin scaffold; however, there is no clear thioesterase (TE) domain in ChmP. The cyclization could occur via a nonenzymatic reaction or a TE located elsewhere in the genome. Cyclization by an unknown mechanism yields the dehydrolactam, and a final O-methylation would afford the final natural product.

Stable Isotope Feeding Experiments Confirm Biosynthetic Origins of Reactive Functional Groups

To determine the biosynthetic precursors of the N-hydroxypyrrole and diazeniumdiolate functional groups, we performed stable isotope feeding experiments. Noting the peptidic nature of chalkophomycin, we hypothesized that theN-hydroxypyrrole would derive from l-proline through a series of oxidations, analogous to one established pathway for pyrrole biosynthesis.23 We proposed that the l-graminine residue could arise either from l-arginine via an SznF-type rearrangement or from an intermolecular N-nitrosation reaction between nitrite and l-ornithine. To test these proposals, 15N-l-proline, 15N4,13C6-l-arginine, 15N2-l-ornithine, or 15N-sodium nitrite was added to cultures of S. sp. Root63, and culture supernatants were analyzed by LC–MS/MS. We chose this strain due to its consistently robust production of chalkophomycin (LC–MS peak areas ∼1.2–3.2 × 107). Significant mass enrichment of chalkophomycin was observed only for the 15N-l-proline and 15N4,13C6-l-arginine-fed cultures (Figure 4A). Moreover, in 15N-l-proline-fed cultures, the label was isolated to fragments containing the N-hydroxypyrrole, and in arginine-fed cultures, mass enrichment of the diagnostic NO-loss localized the arginine-derived labels to the diazeniumdiolate group (Figures 4B and S5). Consistent with our findings, while our studies were ongoing, efforts to characterize the biosynthetic origin of l-graminine in gramibactin and tistrellabactin biosynthesis also revealed l-arginine as the source of the diazeniumdiolate.6,24

Figure 4 Stable isotope labeling determines precursors for chalkophomycin biosynthesis. (A) 13C and 15N are incorporated into chalkophomycin from l-proline and l-arginine by the metabolomic analysis of S. sp. Root63 cultures supplemented with isotopically enriched substrate. Percent enrichment for each substrate (Mean ± SD%): 15N-l-proline (64.93 ± 9.52%), 15N-sodium nitrite (1.88 ± 0.08%), 15N2-l-ornithine (11.65 ± 4.16%), and 15N4,13C6-l-arginine (49.03 ± 3.58%). (B) LC–MS/MS of chalkophomycin results in 15NO fragment loss when 15N4,13C6-l-arginine is incorporated, localizing arginine-derived atoms to the diazeniumdiolate.

N-Hydroxypyrrole Biosynthesis Requires Two Flavin-Dependent Enzymes

With key chalkophomycin biosynthetic precursors identified, we next investigated the activities of enzymes responsible for constructing an unusual N-hydroxypyrrole heterocycle. N-hydroxypyrroles are rarely found in natural products but have been observed previously in hormaomycin, glycerinopyrin, pyranonigrins B and C, and surugapyrroles A and B.25−30 Chalkophomycin is the first example of this functional group serving as a metal-binding ligand. Additionally, pyrroles are a widespread motif in pharmaceuticals.31,32 The N-hydroxypyrrole heterocycle likely has several distinct biosynthetic origins, including from l-leucine and a linear PKS product (Figure S7).33−36 However, in all cases, the enzymatic chemistry involved in N-hydroxypyrrole formation has eluded characterization.

Analysis of the chm BGC revealed four genes encoding likely candidate N-hydroxypyrrole-forming enzymes (chmGHIJ). A closely related set of genes is also found in the hormaomycin BGC (hrmKLMN); however, these genes and their encoded enzymes have never been investigated.37 Three of these genes share annotations with several previously characterized enzymes required for thiotemplated pyrrole biosynthesis: an acyl carrier protein (ACP), a proline-specific adenylating enzyme, and an FAD-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD).23,38 The adenylating enzyme uses ATP to activate l-proline via a prolyl-AMP intermediate that is transferred onto the thiol of the phosphopantetheine (ppant) arm of the ACP. The ACAD then catalyzes a 4-electron oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring of the prolyl thioester to the corresponding pyrrole prior to further elaboration of the pyrrole scaffold.38,39 The chm gene cluster encodes an ACP (ChmI) and an adenylase (ChmJ); however, it encodes two putative ACADs (ChmG and ChmH). We envisioned the second ACAD might perform N-oxygenation post-pyrrole formation.40

To elucidate the biosynthetic logic of N-hydroxypyrrole formation, we reconstituted its biosynthesis in vitro (Figure 5A). ChmI and ChmJ were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and their activity toward l-proline was examined (see the Supporting Information for further details). When holo-ChmI and ChmJ were incubated with ATP and l-proline, we observed l-proline loading onto the ppant arm of ChmI via LC–MS (4), which was further confirmed by targeted MS/MS to release a diagnostic ppant-proline fragment (Figure 5C,E). When ChmJ, ATP, or l-proline were omitted from assay mixtures, prolyl-ChmI (4) was not observed (Figure S8), indicating that ChmJ activates l-proline for loading onto the ppant arm of ChmI.

Figure 5 N-oxygenation precedes pyrrole formation in the biosynthesis of N-hydroxypyrrole. (A) l-Proline is converted to N-hydroxypyrrole-2-carboxylic acid by ChmIJGHF. Note the C2–C3 double bond in 6 is proposed based on literature precedent but has not been experimentally confirmed. (B) MUSCLE alignment of ChmG and ChmH with characterized pyrrole-forming enzymes Bmp3, PltE, and RedW shows that only ChmH retains the catalytic glutamate required for pyrrolidine dehydrogenation. AlphaFold2 models of ChmH and ChmG superimposed with Bmp3 crystal structure (PDB: 6CXT) show the spatial alignment of the glutamate and methionine residues, respectively. Pyrrolyl-ppant (green) and FAD (yellow) are from the Bmp3 structure. (C) Whole protein LC–MS activity assay demonstrates that LflChmG and LflChmH are required for the modification of the ChmI-proline substrate. (D) Free N-hydroxypyrrole-2-carboxylic acid is hydrolyzed from ChmI in the presence of ChmF, as observed by LC–MS. (E) LC–MS/MS of whole protein mass features in panel (C) confirms proline modification from observation of the ppant-derived mass features.

We next examined the candidate enzymes for l-proline oxidation. Both ChmG and ChmH are annotated as ACADs. ACADs, including RedW, PltE, and Bmp3, catalyze the 4-electron oxidation of carrier protein-bound l-proline to the corresponding pyrrole.23,38,39 Although ChmG and ChmH are most similar to RedW, they share only 24 and 31% aa ID with this protein, respectively. As such, it was not evident which of the two proteins may perform dehydrogenation and whether there may be differences between this system and the characterized pyrrole-forming pathways. Moreover, ChmG and ChmH share only 22% aa ID with each other, suggesting that they might perform distinct chemical transformations.

Multiple sequence alignments revealed that ChmH has the conserved, catalytic glutamate residue essential for pyrrole formation in AnaB and Bmp3 (Figures 5B and S9).41,42 This catalytic base is proposed to initiate substrate oxidation by deprotonation of C2–H to form a prolyl thioester enolate, facilitating subsequent hydride transfer to FAD. Although the exact position of hydride transfer (C3 or N1) has not been confirmed experimentally, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) studies of the Bmp1–Bmp3 complex suggest hydride transfer from C3 as the most favorable.43 Unlike the characterized proline oxidases, ChmG has a methionine at this position, suggesting that it might catalyze a distinct reaction. Searches with the DALI server using an AlphaFold2-generated structure of ChmG revealed structural similarity to the flavin-dependent amino sugar N-oxygenase KijD3 (24% aa ID), suggesting ChmG might possess N-oxygenase activity (Table S3).44−47 This was not evident from ChmG′s sequence or gene annotation, making it unique in the ACAD superfamily for its proposed N-oxygenase activity toward a proline-derived thioester. Combined with a phylogenetic analysis of the broader “Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase” enzyme family (IPR006091) (Figure S10), these data led us to hypothesize that ChmH catalyzes the 4-electron oxidation of proline prior to ChmG-catalyzed N-oxygenation. This proposed logic would resemble those of other biosyntheses of functionalized pyrroles.

To test this proposal, we biochemically characterized ChmH and ChmG in vitro. After encountering significant difficulties expressing the enzymes from S. anulatus, we successfully expressed homologues from L. flaviverrucosa DSM 44664 (LflChmG and LflChmH) in E. coli. We first tested whether either LflChmG or LflChmH could oxidize ChmI-tethered prolyl thioester 4 (Figure 5C,E). Notably, no activity toward 4 was observed when LflChmH was added alone (Figure S11). By contrast, when LflChmG alone was added to assay mixtures containing holo-ChmI, ChmJ, proline, and ATP, 4 was converted primarily to a species consistent with ChmI-N-hydroxydehydroproline (6). Control experiments omitting NADPH or adding a flavin reductase to the reaction mixture resulted in varied product ratios of 5 and 6, with both being formed, but the more highly oxidized product, 6, was more abundant under conditions with higher FADH2 concentrations (Figure S12A,B). To control for the role that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play in this reaction, superoxide dismutase (100 U/mL) and catalase (35 U/mL) were added to the reaction mixtures. Both 5 and 6 were formed when only LflChmG was added, but the product distribution favored 5, suggesting ROS may be accelerating the conversion of 5 to 6 (Figure S12C). 1 was still formed with both LflChmG and LflChmH, confirming that dehydrogenation is enzyme-catalyzed (Figure S12D). Addition of LflChmH following preaccumulation of 5 and 6 results in the formation of 1 (Figure S13). These results indicate that N-oxygenation occurs prior to dehydrogenation in the biosynthesis of 1 and that both 5 and 6 may be on-pathway intermediates.

Collectively, our results demonstrate that thiotemplated N-hydroxypyrrole biosynthesis uses two distinct flavin-dependent enzymes. ChmG first catalyzes N-oxygenation of ChmI-proline, followed by either a 2- or 4-electron oxidation by ChmH to afford the final ChmI-bound N-hydroxypyrrole (1). This order of events has never been previously observed for thiotemplated biosynthesis of functionalized pyrroles, which has exclusively involved pyrrole formation prior to further transformations, such as halogenation.48 Additionally, ChmG is the first example of a prolyl N-oxygenase and the first nonassembly line-associated flavin-dependent N-oxygenase to act on an aminoacyl-ACP substrate, broadening our knowledge of these oxygenases.

ChmF Hydrolyzes N-Hydroxypyrrole from ChmI

Located near chmGHIJ in the chm BGC is chmF, a gene encoding a predicted α,β-hydrolase. This BGC also encodes a putative adenylate-forming enzyme (ChmK) that is predicted to accept 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid or salicylic acid (Table S2). We hypothesized that ChmF hydrolyzes the N-hydroxypyrrole thioester from ChmI and that ChmK adenylates the resulting N-hydroxypyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (2) for loading onto NRPS ChmL. Alternatively, this hydrolase may remove incorrectly loaded substrates from a carrier protein. To test the proposal that ChmF hydrolyzes the N-hydroxypyrrole thioester, we added ChmF to an assay mixture containing ChmIJGH and all of the necessary cofactors. We found that ChmF hydrolyzed N-hydroxypyrrole from ChmI (Figure 5C–E). Both the ChmI-ppant (7) and free N-hydroxypyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (2) products were observed by LC–MS only when ChmF was included in the reaction. ChmF appears to specifically recognize the N-hydroxypyrrole substrate, as little or no activity was observed toward 4 or the ChmG reaction products, 5 and 6 (Figure S14). Although it may seem inefficient to generate free N-hydroxypyrrole for reloading onto the assembly line, perhaps this enables incorporation of N-hydroxypyrrole into other additional biosynthetic pathways. When ChmK and ChmL were added to this reaction mixture, we observed the loading of N-hydroxypyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (2) onto the first thiolation domain of ChmL (Figure S15). This not only confirms that ChmF hydrolyzes N-hydroxypyrrole, but it also identifies ChmK as an adenylase for N-hydroxypyrroles. This logic also differs from characterized biosynthetic pathways that generate pyrroles from l-proline, where the pyrrole is assembled on a carrier protein and transferred to the subsequent NRPS or PKS without hydrolysis.49

Bioinformatic Analysis Reveals Many N-Hydroxypyrrole-Encoding BGCs

With an understanding of N-hydroxypyrrole biosynthesis, we next examined the extent to which additional BGCs may produce this rare, functionalized heterocycle. Using prettyClusters, a set of tools that facilitate the analysis and visualization of genomic neighborhoods for a gene of interest, we identified 4 distinct classes of BGCs from 97 different organisms that encode homologues of the N-hydroxypyrrole forming enzymes (Figures 6 and S16).50 Many of these BGCs lack genes that encode obvious N-nitrosating enzymes. Notably, BGCs encoding this biosynthetic machinery are found in multiple human and plant pathogens, such as Nocardia nova and Pseudomonas fluorescens. This highlights the existence of additional undiscovered N-hydroxypyrrole-containing metabolites.

Figure 6 N-hydroxypyrrole biosynthetic genes appear in many BGCs, suggesting that this heterocycle is present in multiple undiscovered natural products.

Heme-Dependent Guanidine N-Oxygenase Replaces the Diiron HDO Domain of SznF

We next sought to characterize chalkophomycin biosynthetic enzymes involved in diazeniumdiolate formation. Our stable isotope feeding experiments revealed l-arginine as the biosynthetic precursor of this functional group, suggesting a pathway for N-nitrosation that parallels that of streptozotocin. However, because the SznF homologue in chalkophomycin biosynthesis (ChmM) lacks the amino acid residues required for diiron binding in its HDO domain, we hypothesized that it would be unable to generate the l-dihydroxyguanidine intermediate required for N-nitrosation. Therefore, we proposed that this pathway would use a different N-oxygenating enzyme. ChmN is annotated as a member of the “YqcI/YcgG uncharacterized protein family.” Recently, two members of this protein family, AglA and GntA, were shown to be heme-dependent guanidine N-oxygenases in argolaphos and guanitoxin biosynthesis, respectively (Figure 7A).51,52 Additionally, DcsA, a related enzyme required for d-cycloserine biosynthesis was found to bind heme, although its activity could not be confirmed in vitro.53 Although ChmN only shares 31% aa ID with AglA and 22% aa ID with GntA, we hypothesized that it could catalyze N-oxygenation of l-arginine, paralleling the transformation performed by SznF’s HDO domain. Notably, 107 genes encoding ChmN homologues colocalize with genes encoding SznF homologues predicted to have inactive HDO domains, further supporting this proposal (Figure S18).

Figure 7 ChmN is a heme-dependent arginine N-oxygenase. (A) YqcI/YcgG uncharacterized protein family has two biochemically characterized members, both of which catalyze guanidine N-oxygenation. (B) Purified ChmN has UV–vis spectroscopic features consistent with a thiolate-bound heme cofactor and is bright red. The C47A variant loses these features and all color, consistent with disruption of the heme-binding ligand. (C) ChmN catalyzes mono- and dihydroxylation of l-arginine. (C) Incubation of ChmN with l-arginine and necessary redox cofactors results in the production of l-Nδ-hydroxyarginine. The hArg standard is a mixture of Nδ-hArg and Nω-hArg synthetic standards. (E) LC–MS samples for the full reaction were left at room temperature for 1 week and reanalyzed. Complete decomposition of Nδ,Nω-dhArg was observed with a corresponding increase in concentration corresponding to a mixture of Nδ-hArg and Nω-hArg. All EICs are graphed on the same y-axis range (0–2 × 105 Ion Counts). (F) Proposed pathway for l-graminine biosynthesis involves the putative N-nitrosating enzymes ChmM and NRPS ChmO.

When recombinantly expressed in E. coli, ChmN bound heme, evidenced by characteristic UV–vis spectroscopic features and a bright red color (Figure 7B). These features and color were lost when putative active site residue Cys47 was substituted with Ala, supporting its role as the axial heme-binding ligand. Moreover, when incubated with l-arginine, NADPH, spinach ferredoxin, and ferredoxin reductase, ChmN catalyzes the production of Nδ-hydroxyarginine (Nδ-hArg, 8) and Nδ,Nω-dihydroxyarginine (Nδ,Nω-dhArg, 3) (Figure 7C,D). Nω-hydroxyarginine (Nω-hArg, 9) was also detected in reaction mixtures and was found to coelute with Nδ-hArg (8), evidenced by LC–MS/MS data and differential fragmentation patterns of the two hydroxyarginine isomers. We found that Nδ-hArg (8) is produced more rapidly than Nω-hArg (9) over a 3 h time course (Figure S19 and Table S6). When supernatants of quenched reaction mixtures were left at room temperature for 1 week, all Nδ,Nω-dhArg (3) disappeared, while we saw an overall increase in the mass corresponding to both hydroxyarginine isomers (Figure 7E). Due to the correlation between Nδ,Nω-dhArg (3) degradation and an increase in Nω-hArg concentration, we concluded that Nω-hArg (9) is the degradation product of Nδ,Nω-dhArg (3). Although purified recombinant ChmM has not yet displayed activity toward any of these arginine derivatives, these data support the proposal that heme-dependent enzymes have evolved to collaborate with SznF-like enzymes in the synthesis of N-nitrosated products (Figure 7F). This is the first biochemical evidence linking the “YqcI/YcgG” enzymes that commonly appear in graminine-encoding gene clusters to the biosynthesis of this diazeniumdiolate-containing amino acid.

Discussion

Although N-hydroxypyrroles have been proposed to originate from amino acids such as l-leucine and l-proline, the enzymes used to construct this heterocycle have never been characterized. By genome mining for biosynthetic pathways involving N-nitrosation, we identified the chalkophomycin BGC and revealed enzymes involved in N-hydroxypyrrole and diazeniumdiolate assembly. While this paper was in revision, an identical chalkophomycin gene cluster was identified in the genome of S. sp. CB00271; however, no biochemical characterization of any enzymes was performed.54

We demonstrate in vitro that l-proline is adenylated by ChmJ and loaded onto the carrier protein ChmI before undergoing N-oxygenation by the flavin-dependent enzyme ChmG. Following N-oxygenation, ChmH catalyzes the formation of the final N-hydroxypyrrole via an FAD-dependent 2- or 4-electron oxidation. This product is then hydrolyzed by ChmF to enable mobilization of the free N-hydroxypyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (2) building block. Characterization of the adenylase ChmK reveals a route for incorporating additional hydroxylated aromatic building blocks into nonribosomal peptides. This knowledge will aid identification of BGCs that encode N-hydroxypyrrole-containing natural products, including novel metallophores.

Prior to this report, thiotemplated biosynthesis of functionalized pyrroles followed a prescribed path of pyrrolidine to pyrrole oxidation prior to further elaboration. Halogen, methoxy, and methyl substituents have also been observed on the carbon atoms of pyrroles in natural products (Figures S20 and S21). Biochemical characterization of the pentabromopseudilin biosynthetic pathway shows the strategy for thiotemplated halopyrrole biosynthesis from l-proline involving an initial flavin-dependent 4-electron oxidation of ACP-bound l-proline followed by halogenation of the ACP-bound pyrrole.39 Methylpyrrole in clorobiocin is synthesized in a similar fashion, where carrier protein-bound l-proline is first oxidized to the pyrrole by ACAD CloN3.55 CloN6 has been proposed to perform a radical-based methylation of the pyrrole due to conservation of a cysteine-rich sequence motif found in the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) protein superfamily, and genetic deletions of cloN6 provide support for methylation occurring after pyrrole formation.56,57 C2-methylpyrrole and methyoxypyrrole have also been described to originate from distinct pathways.49,58,59

The characterization of enzymatic N-hydroxypyrrole formation represents a deviation from this established logic. Unlike the established order of proline oxidation, followed by pyrrole functionalization, the Chm system catalyzes N-hydroxylation of proline prior to pyrrole formation. This order of events could perhaps reflect a strict requirement for the more nucleophilic nitrogen of the pyrrolidine to engage the presumed hydroperoxyflavin electrophile to achieve N-oxygenation.

This logic was not expected from prior analyses of the hormaomycin BGC.37 It was noted upon analysis of the hrm BGC that it did not reveal an obvious candidate for N-oxygenation, and in fact, it was incorrectly proposed that the ChmG and ChmH homologues, HrmN and HrmM, worked together to catalyze pyrrole formation prior to N-hydroxylation by an unknown enzyme. Not only does our work reveal the functions of these enzymes, but it also corrects this mis-held assumption. Moreover, ChmG is, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance of both enzymatic proline N-oxygenation and N-oxygenation of a carrier protein-bound substrate by a flavin-dependent enzyme.

Using the newly elucidated genetic basis for N-hydroxypyrrole formation, we identified cryptic BGCs that construct this structural motif. Although N-hydroxypyrrole biosynthetic genes only co-occur with putative N-nitrosating enzymes in the chm BGC, these genes do appear near additional genes encoding siderophore transporters and NRPSs. In other BGCs, they are clustered with genes encoding nonassembly line-type biosynthetic enzymes. These BGCs are found in the genomes of many Nocardia and Pseudomonas species that are opportunistic human pathogens. Given that competition for iron and other metals influences bacterial virulence, it is possible these putative metallophores may contribute to growth or pathogenicity.60,61 These BGCs present exciting opportunities for natural product discovery that may reveal new biological functions for N-hydroxypyrroles.

In addition to characterizing N-hydroxypyrrole biosynthesis, we discovered the activity of ChmN, a heme-dependent arginine N-oxygenase. Our results provide the first biochemical experimental insights into how l-arginine is transformed into l-graminine. Interestingly, we observed that genes encoding members of this family often co-occur in gene clusters alongside genes encoding SznF homologues predicted to lack a functional HDO domain. Therefore, we propose that ChmN and its relatives functionally replace the HDO domain’s role in N-nitrosation. This enzyme adds to our knowledge of the nascent YqcI/YcgG protein family, with heme-binding and guanidine N-oxygenation emerging as common features. Of note, this would be the first case in which a YqcI/YcgG enzyme catalyzes dihydroxylation and in which the hydroxyguanidine product motif is not observed in the final natural product structure, suggesting great potential for how these enzymes may be implemented in diverse biosynthetic pathways. This work substantially increases our understanding of this poorly characterized enzyme family, which has >4000 members (IPR014988).

Although the N–N bond-forming activity in chalkophomycin biosynthesis has yet to be reconstituted, ongoing efforts are directed toward this goal. The NRPS protein ChmO is the most likely candidate for incorporation of l-graminine into chalkophomycin. Interestingly, ChmO has a completely distinct A-domain substrate recognition sequence than that found in the NRPS enzymes predicted to activate and incorporate l-graminine in the gramibactin, megapolibactin, plantaribactin, gladiobactin, and tistrellabactin biosynthetic pathways (Table S2).6,17 While this could suggest that multiple A-domain sequences are dedicated to l-graminine adenylation, it could also indicate a distinct pathway for l-graminine biosynthesis where the l-dihydroxyguanidine precursor is recognized by the NRPS and the diazeniumdiolate is formed on a protein-tethered substrate. N-nitrosation of a protein-based aminoacyl thioester substrate would result in a dramatic expansion of the activity of the SznF enzyme family. Moreover, the ability of these enzymes to generate both diazeniumdiolates and N-nitrosoureas raises questions about the mechanistic differences between ChmM and SznF. Specifically, enzymes that form l-graminine must promote carbon and nitrogen excision, while N-nitrosourea formation retains all atoms from the l-dihydroxyarginine substrate in the product.

Over the last two decades, genome mining has enabled the discovery of new microbial BGCs and natural products. This effort and previous studies have demonstrated the value of genome mining in identifying metallophore-encoding gene clusters by searching for putative N-nitrosating enzymes that construct a key metal-binding functional group. The discovery of the chalkophomycin biosynthetic pathway and the elucidation of N-hydroxypyrrole biosynthesis underscore how such efforts can also provide unanticipated opportunities for enzyme and metabolite discovery.

Experimental Section

Cultivation of S. anulatus ATCC 11523 for Chalkophomycin Production

S. anulatus ATCC 11523 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). S. anulatus ATCC 11523 was grown on Mannitol Soy Agar (MS agar) (20 g/L d-mannitol, 20 g/L soybean flour, 20 g/L agar) for 9 days or until spores were produced. Spores were scraped using a sterile 10 μL inoculating loop and used to inoculate 30 mL of liquid TSB medium. Cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm for 2 days. 5 mL of TSB starter culture was used to inoculate 50 mL of M2 medium (15 g/L soluble starch, 5 g/L Pharmamedia, 100 mg/L CuSO4·5H2O, 5 mg/L NaI, 3 g/L CaCO3, pH 7) with 1.5 g (dry weight) activated HP20 resin (n = 6). Cultures were placed in a 30 °C incubator and shaken at 220 rpm for 7 days.

After 7 days, the 50 mL S. anulatus ATCC 11523 cultures were decanted into conical tubes, and the cells and resin were pelleted by centrifugation (3,220g, 10 min). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed 3x with Milli-Q water or until the supernatant was clear after centrifugation. 45 mL of MeOH was added to the pellet and left to incubate for 10 min, with gentle inversion every few minutes. The resin was pelleted again by centrifugation, and the MeOH supernatant was concentrated using a rotary evaporator and further dried under vacuum overnight.

To the concentrated residue was added 1 mL of MeCN and 1 mL of H2O. 10 μL of the resuspended material was diluted into 90 μL of 5% MeCN in H2O. The samples were spun at 16,100g for 10 min, and the supernatants were transferred into vials for analysis by LC–MS, using an Agilent Q-TOF 6530 equipped with a Dual AJS ESI source and a Kinetex C18 column (1.7 μm, 100 Å, 150 × 2.1 mm) flowing at a rate of 0.2 mL/min in a column compartment heated to 35 °C. Solution A was H2O + 0.1% formic acid, and Solution B was MeCN + 0.1% formic acid. The LC method was as follows: 5% Solution B for 5 min, 5–95% Solution B over 25 min, 95% Solution B for 5 min, 95–5% over 1 min, hold at 5% for 10 min. The following parameters were used for the Q-TOF: gas temp 275 °C, drying gas 11 L/min, nebulizer 35 psi, sheath gas temp 275 °C, sheath gas flow 11 L/min, VCap 3500 V, and nozzle voltage 500 V.

Cultivation of Streptomyces sp. Root63, Streptomyces sp. Root1295, and L. flaviverrucosa DSM 44664 for Chalkophomycin Production

Streptomyces sp. Root63, Streptomyces sp. Root1295, and L. flaviverrucosa were purchased from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ. Each strain was grown on MS agar until sporulating, about 3 days. Spores were scraped from the plate using a 10 μL inoculating loop and used to inoculate 30 mL of liquid TSB medium. Cultures were grown for 3 days at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm until being saturated. 750 μL of TSB starter culture was used to inoculate 25 mL of R2B medium supplemented with 100 mg/L Cu(II)SO4·5H2O (400 μM final concentration) (n = 5 per strain). Cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm for 1 week, after which cells were pelleted (8000g, 10 min), and the supernatants were filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. The filtrate was lyophilized to dryness. To the concentrated residue was added 500 μL of LC–MS grade MeCN and 500 μL of LC–MS grade water. The resuspended material was diluted 1:10 into water, and the samples were spun at 16,100g for 10 min. The supernatants were transferred into vials for analysis by LC–MS. The same parameters for chalkophomycin detection from S. anulatus cultures were used.

Heterologous Expression of chm Gene Cluster in S. coelicolor M1152

A 5 mL culture of E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 pDualP-chm was grown in LB with apramycin (50 μg/mL), kanamycin (50 μg/mL), and chloramphenicol (20 μg/mL) at 37 °C with shaking at 190 rpm for 2 days until being saturated. Cells were passaged 1:100 in a 5 mL culture of LB with apramycin (50 μg/mL) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until the OD600 reached 0.6, after which the cells were pelleted at 4000g for 5 min. The cells were washed twice with 5 mL of LB without any antibiotics. After washing, the cells were resuspended in 500 μL of LB. To prepare the heterologous host, S. coelicolor M1152, for conjugation, 10 μL of spores from a frozen glycerol stock were added to 500 μL 2xYT medium. Spores were heat-shocked at 50 °C for 10 min and allowed to cool before they were added to the 500 μL of concentrated E. coli cells. The mixture was briefly centrifuged at 8000g to pellet the cells. The supernatant was removed to leave ∼50 μL of liquid. The pelleted cells were resuspended by gently pipetting up and down, and they were plated on MS agar that contained 10 mM MgCl2 and incubated at 30 °C. 16 h after plating, the plate was overlaid with 0.5 mg nalidixic acid and 1.25 mg apramycin in 1 mL of water and then returned to incubate at 30 °C for 6 days. Successful exconjugants were restreaked on MS agar with apramycin (50 μg/mL) and nalidixic acid (30 μg/mL).

A 20 mL portion of TSB medium was inoculated with spores from a plate of wild-type S. coelicolor M1152 or S. coelicolor pDualP-chm grown on MS agar with no antibiotic or apramycin (50 μg/mL) for the respective strains. TSB starter cultures of wild-type S. coelicolor contained no antibiotics, and cultures of S. coelicolor pDualP-chm contained 50 μg/mL apramycin. After 3–4 days of shaking at 30 °C and 200 rpm, 750 μL of culture was used to inoculate 25 mL of R2B + 100 mg/L Cu(II)SO4·5H2O (n = 6). Cultures were left to incubate for 9 days at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm, after which cells were pelleted at 8000g for 10 min. Supernatants were passed through a 0.2 μm filter and lyophilized to dryness.

The concentrated culture supernatants were resuspended in 500 μL of LC–MS grade water and 500 μL of LC–MS grade MeCN and then diluted 1:10 in water. The samples were centrifuged at 16,100g for 10 min, and the sample supernatants were used for LC–MS analysis of chalkophomycin production. LC–MS parameters are identical to those listed above for detecting chalkophomycin in S. anulatus cultures.

Stable Isotope Feeding in Streptomyces sp. Root63

Streptomyces sp. Root63 was struck out on MS agar from a frozen spore stock stored at −70 °C until sporulating. 20 mL of sterile TSB was inoculated with spores from this plate and incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 3–4 days. 750 μL of the TSB seed culture was passaged into 25 mL of R2B + 100 mg/L Cu(II)SO4·5H2O and returned to the incubator at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. After 48 h, a 1 mM isotope-enriched substrate was added to cultures [13C6,15N4-l-arginine (99%) (n = 3), 15N2-l-ornithine (98%) (n = 3), 15N-sodium nitrite (98%) (n = 2), or 15N-proline (98%) (n = 3); Cambridge Isotope Laboratories]. After 5 d of growth, cultures were filtered through a 0.2 μm filter, and the filtrate was lyophilized to dryness. The lyophilized filtrate was resuspended in 500 μL of LC–MS grade MeCN and 500 μL of Milli-Q water. This solution was diluted 1:5 into Milli-Q water to prepare samples for LC–MS.

Samples were analyzed by LC–MS on a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap IQ-X equipped with an HESI source using a Kinetex C18 column (1.7 μm, 100 Å, 150 mm × 2.1 mm) flowing at a rate of 0.4 mL/min in a column compartment heated to 35 °C. Solution A was H2O + 0.1% formic acid, and Solution B was MeCN + 0.1% formic acid. The LC method was: 5% Solution B for 2 min, 5–80% Solution B over 27 min, 80% Solution B for 3 min, and re-equilibrated to 5% Solution B for 3 min. The following parameters were used for the Orbitrap detection: resolution 60k, RF Lens 35%, standard AGC target, and auto maximum injection time mode.

General Method for Expression and Purification of Chm Enzymes

All proteins were expressed using BL21(DE3) E. coli or BAP1(DE3)62E. coli and appropriate expression vectors (see the Supporting Information for further details). An overnight culture of liquid LB medium supplemented with either 50 μg/mL kanamycin or 100 μg/mL ampicillin was inoculated from a frozen glycerol stock of E. coli harboring the expression vector for the desired protein and allowed to shake at 170 rpm and 37 °C. pET28a and pETDuet-1 were the two expression vectors used in this study. For each liter of protein expression culture (LB + antibiotic), 10 mL of the overnight culture was used for inoculation. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm until they reached an OD600 of 0.4–0.6. Protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG (250 μM), and the cultures were returned to shaking with a lowered temperature at 16 °C for overnight expression.

The following day, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,730g. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2, pH 8) and sonicated. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (18,000g, 35 min), and the clarified lysate was applied to a column of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen and Thermo Fisher) pre-equilibrated in wash buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM imidazole, pH 8) for purification. The resin was washed with wash buffer 1, followed by wash buffer 2 (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 60 mM imidazole, pH 8), before eluting the protein of interest with elution buffer (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 200 mM imidazole, pH 8). The protein was buffer exchanged into storage buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 10% w/v glycerol, pH 7.5) prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Protein aliquots were stored at −70 °C until needed.
