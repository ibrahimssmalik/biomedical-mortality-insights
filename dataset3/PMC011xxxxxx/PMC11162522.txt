We present a genome assembly from a specimen of Potentilla anserina (the silverweed cinquefoil; Streptophyta; eudicotyledons; Rosales; Potentilleae). The haploid genome sequence is 237 megabases in span. Most of the assembly is scaffolded into seven chromosomal pseudomolecules. The mitochondrial and plastid genomes have also been assembled and are 294.6 and 155.6 kilobases in length respectively.

Background

Potentilla anserina L. (Rosaceae) ( Figure 1) is a wide-spread and common perennial across Britain and Ireland which can easily be spotted creeping along the ground in a diversity of habitats like meadows, grasslands, riversides, rough ground and roadsides. Its pinnate leaves are covered below in silver-grey hairs giving rise to its common name, silverweed.

Figure 1. Example images of Potentilla anserina (not the sampled specimen) growing in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, showing ( a) the whole plant, ( b) a close-up view of the silvery leaves, and ( c) a close-up of the flower (photos A.R. Leitch).

Taxonomy of the genus Potentilla L. is contentious, and based on molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear and plastid markers ( Eriksson et al., 1998; Töpel et al., 2011), it was shown that the genus in the traditional sense is polyphyletic, with diverse genera like Alchemilla L. and Fragaria L. embedded in it. Potentilla is sometimes treated in the broad sense to include these genera, but it is also often subdivided, with Potentilla anserina (and 70 related species) placed in the genus Argentina Hill [as A. anserina (L.) Rydb.]. Nevertheless, we here follow Stace (2010) to be consistent with the taxonomy used for all British and Irish vascular plants sampled by the Darwin Tree of Life.

Globally, silverweed cinquefoil has an extensive native range from the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia to the mountains of New Mexico and the Himalayas in Asia ( POWO, 2023; Rousi, 1965). It is tolerant of disturbance, pollution, inundation and drought. It is therefore not surprising that it is widespread and thriving across Britain and Ireland, with little change in its distribution over the last 60 years. It is also frequently naturalised outside its native range, including Argentina, Australia, Chile and New Zealand.

Many uses of P. anserina have been documented, giving rise to some of the local names associated with this species. For example, it has been called ‘traveller’s ease’, perhaps from reports that it was used by Roman soldiers as a botanical shoe insole to provide padding and absorb sweat on their long marches (possibly because the high starch content helps to absorb moisture). In addition, its highly starchy stolons often provided an important food source, especially during famine, giving rise to the name of ‘bread and butter’ in some parts of the UK. For thousands of years P. anserina has been used in traditional medicine to treat a wide diversity of symptoms – e.g. coughs, diarrhoea and viral infections ( Tomczyk & Latté, 2009) – with recent biochemical studies validating their use – e.g. the role of distinctive polysaccharides extracted from roots in relieving coughing ( Guo et al., 2016) and the suppression of Hepatitis B growth by a specific triterpenoid saponin isolated from the rhizome ( Zhao et al., 2008).

While tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 28), pentaploid (2 n = 5 x = 34) and hexaploid (2 n = 6 x = 42) individuals of P. anserina have been reported, tetraploids are the most common across its native distribution ( Ockendon & Walters, 1970; Rice et al., 2015), with a recent genomic analysis suggesting that the tetraploid is an ancient allopolyploid estimated to have formed c. 6.4 million years ago ( Gan et al., 2021). While the ancestral genome donors are unclear, comparative sequence analysis suggests that one of the two parents may be P. micrantha Ramond ex DC. or a close relative ( Gan et al., 2021). Fossil achenes are known from the Pleistocene and Pliocene of Europe ( Velichkevich & Zastawniak, 2003).

The in-depth genomic analyses of a tetraploid accession of P. anserina, made possible by the release of this high-quality chromosome level genome sequence, will enable further exploration of the evolution of this ancient polyploid genome. Analyses of the genomic networks underpinning the biochemical pathways, which have contributed to the rich diversity of metabolites, may also provide opportunities for bioprospecting to identify novel medicines.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from a Potentilla anserina specimen collected from along the River Thames in Canbury Gardens, Kingston upon Thames (latitude 51.42, longitude –0.31). Using flow cytometry, the genome size (1C-value) was estimated to be 0.56 pg, equivalent to 550 Mb which is similar in size to a previous estimate by flow cytometry for an autotetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 48) cytotype ( Šmarda et al., 2019) and gives an estimated haploid genome size comprising 7 chromosomes of 275 Mb. A total of 36-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads and 61-fold coverage in 10X Genomics read clouds were generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected eight missing joins or mis-joins and removed 12 haplotypic duplications, reducing the assembly length by 48.31% and the scaffold number by 48.43%, and increasing the scaffold N50 by 18.96%.

The final haploid assembly has a total length of 237.1 Mb in 148 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 28.9 Mb ( Table 1). Most (87.84%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to seven chromosomal-level scaffolds. Chromosome-scale scaffolds are named by synteny based on the genome assembly of Fragaria nilgerrensis Schltdl. ex J.Gay (eudicots) GCA_010134655.1 ( Figure 2– Figure 5; Table 2). The mitochondrial and plastid genomes were also assembled. The assembly has a BUSCO v5.3.2 ( Manni et al., 2021) completeness of 90.5% (single 88.8%, duplicated 1.7%) using the eudicots_odb10 reference set ( n = 2,326). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the other similar three haplotype sets of the tetraploid have also been deposited.

Methods

Sample acquisition, genome size estimation and nucleic acid extraction

A Potentilla anserina specimen (drPotAnse1) was collected in Canbury Gardens, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, UK (latitude 51.42, longitude –0.31) on 12 August 2020. The specimen was picked by hand by Maarten Christenhusz (Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew) collection number 9040, and identified by the same person. The specimen was preserved at –80°C.

The genome size was estimated by flow cytometry using the fluorochrome propidium iodide and following the ‘one-step’ method outlined in ( Pellicer et al., 2021). Specifically for this species, the General Purpose Buffer (GPB) supplemented with 3% PVP and 0.08% (v/v) beta-mercaptoethanol was used for isolation of nuclei ( Loureiro et al., 2007), and the internal calibration standard was Petroselinum crispum ‘Champion Moss Curled’ with an assumed 1C-value of 2.20 Gb ( Obermayer et al., 2002).

DNA was extracted at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The drPotAnse1 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice with tissue set aside for Hi-C sequencing. Leaf tissue was cryogenically disrupted to a fine powder using a Covaris cryoPREP Automated Dry Pulveriser, receiving multiple impacts. High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Plant MagAttract HMW DNA extraction kit. Low molecular weight DNA was removed from a 20 ng aliquot of extracted DNA using the 0.8X AMpure XP purification kit prior to 10X Chromium sequencing; a minimum of 50 ng DNA was submitted for 10X sequencing. HMW DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30. Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation using AMPure PB beads with a 1.8X ratio of beads to sample to remove the shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA sample. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

RNA was extracted from the leaf tissue of drPotAnse1 in the Tree of Life Laboratory at the WSI using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was then eluted in 50 μl RNAse-free water and its concentration assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit RNA Broad-Range (BR) Assay kit. Analysis of the integrity of the RNA was done using Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit and Eukaryotic Total RNA assay.

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus and 10X Genomics read cloud DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Poly(A) RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the NEB Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit. DNA and RNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi), Illumina HiSeq 4000 (RNA-Seq) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (10X) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from tissue of drPotAnse1 using the Arima v2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). One round of polishing was performed by aligning 10X Genomics read data to the assembly with Long Ranger ALIGN, calling variants with FreeBayes ( Garrison & Marth, 2012). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using SALSA2 ( Ghurye et al., 2019). The assembly was checked for contamination as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes were assembled using MBG ( Rautiainen & Marschall, 2021) from PacBio HiFi reads mapping to related genomes. A representative circular sequence was selected for each from the graphs based on read coverage.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

This article reports a genome assembly of  Potentilla anserina. About 88% of the assembly sequence was assigned to seven chromosomes.  This genome provides a new addition for comparative genomic analyses of Rosaceae species and polyploidy evolution. I am happy to see the publication of this article.

In a previous study, Potentilla anserina was inferred to be a allotetraploid and two sub genomes A and B were assembled (Gan et al., 2021). However, in this study, only one haploid was assembled. Please clarify the difference in genome assembly between this study and Gan's report.
