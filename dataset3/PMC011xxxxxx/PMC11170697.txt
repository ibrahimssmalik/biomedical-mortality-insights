Engineered artificial minerals (EnAMs) are the core of a new concept of designing scavenger compounds for the recovery of critical elements from slags. It requires a fundamental understanding of solidification from complex oxide melts. Ion diffusivity and viscosity play vital roles in this process. In the melt, phase separations and ion transport give rise to gradients/increments in composition and, with it, to ion diffusivity, temperature, and viscosity. Due to this complexity, solidification phenomena are yet not well understood. If the melt is understood as increments of simple composition on a microscopic level, then the properties of these are more easily accessible from models and experiments. Here, we obtain these data for three stoichiometric lithium aluminum oxides. LiAlO2 is a promising EnAM for the recovery of lithium from lithium-ion battery pyrometallurgical processing. It is obtained through the addition of aluminum to the recycling slag melt. The high temperature properties spanning from below to above the liquidus temperature of three stoichiometric Li–Al–Oxides: Li5AlO4, LiAlO2, and LiAl5O8 are determined using molecular dynamic simulations. The compounds are also synthesized via the sol–gel route. The Li+ ion exhibits the largest diffusivity. They are quite mobile already below the liquidus temperature, i.e., for LiAlO2 at T = 1700 K, the diffusion coefficient of the lithium ion equals D = 3.0 × 10–9 m2 s–1. The other ions Al3+ and O2– do not move considerably at that temperature. The diffusivity of Li+ is largest in the lithium-rich compound Li5AlO4 with D = 32 × 10–9 m2 s–1 at 2500 K. The lower the viscosity, the higher the lithium content. The Li5AlO4 exhibits a viscosity of η = 2.2 mPa s at 1328 K which matches well with the experimentally determined 2.5 mPa s at this temperature. The viscosity of LiAlO2 at 1800 K is more than two times higher. These data sets can help to describe the melts on a microscopic level and understand how the melt properties will change due to gradients in the Li/Al concentration.

Recovery of Critical Materials from Slags

The recovery of critical materials from waste streams has become a major concern in industrialized regions of the world with limited primary resources. The European Union has defined a list of materials critical for its economy and accessed their supply risk for the first time in 2011. It has been updating this list ever since.1 From the correlation of both, specific elements and materials were considered critical and of high priority for recycling efforts and prospecting. For example, heavy rare earth elements are considered very critical.2 With respect to increasing use of electric vehicles, cobalt and, recently, lithium have been rated critical materials.3,4 Various pyrometallurgical routes have already been developed, e.g., by the company Umicore (bath T of approx. 1723 K).5 As these routes only concentrate on the recovery of the more noble elements such as cobalt, nickel, and copper, it is accepted that elements with high oxygen affinity (e.g., lithium, rare earth elements, tantalum) migrate into the slag.6,7 The maximum yield of lithium in the slag is reported to be >80 wt % of the total Li of the recycled batteries.8 However, a substantial amount is lost through evaporation. Although recycling processes including hydrometallurgical leaching of Li from the battery recycling slags have been developed,9 commonly, the slags are reused in construction work and the critical elements incorporated into them are lost for recovery. Leaching procedures are sometimes discussed.10 A new highly promising concept to facilitate a cost- and resource-efficient recovery is to bind these elements in minerals that can be easily separated and enriched from the slag. This new approach, which is currently being investigated in various research projects, is known as the “engineered artificial minerals” method. The term most often used to refer to these minerals is “engineered artificial minerals” (EnAM).2,6,11 The concept of EnAM formation and liberation is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Concept of EnAM. Starting from the left: initially the melt is represented by a high degree of dispersion of the constituting cations and the oxygen counterions. Tetrahedral cation-oxygen polytops like [SiO4]n− can form networks by oxygen bridging, here represented in yellow triangles. The purple squares represent cations which do not form networks, e.g., Ca2+. The critical cation is presented as red hexagons, e.g., Li+. To drive the critical element in a solitary phase, a mineral forming additive is added, here green diamonds, e.g., Al3+. After solidification, the EnAM ideally binds all critical elements (middle image). Here, the rectangles constituted of red and green elements. These are separated in the last step from the “gangue” material.

An efficient liberation and separation in general require the EnAM to be the only/main compound formed from the melt bearing the critical element. Meaning, the ratio of the fraction of the element in the slag matrix (ElSM) to the fraction in the EnAm compound (ElEnAm) is minimized: ElSM/ElEnAm = min (optimum: 0). In the optimum case, the crystal morphology is isometric and the crystallite size is maximized, as small dendritic or needle-shaped crystals make liberation more difficult.6,12 Though there is a maximum in flotation, usually 20–40 μm,13 comminution will allow to liberate particle of this size, when the grain size is larger. If possible, an EnAm compound should be an early or first crystallizate, as this ensures that the crystals have sufficient space to grow and the target element cannot be incorporated into any other compound. Accordingly, it is necessary to synthesize compounds from the melt that crystallize first at high temperatures and exhibit no competing phases.

Solidification of Slags

The solidification from these complex melts is not well understood. Though the thermodynamic prediction of phase transitions is fundamental to understand compound formation, solidification from high temperature melts <1273 K is additionally governed kinetically.14 The viscosity of the melt and the individual ion diffusivity play a vital role in this process.15,16 In viscous melts, solidification may occur without predicted crystal formation. High viscosity and low ion diffusivity can limit the support of the constituent elements during crystal growth. The processes in the melts can be quite complex. During cooling, phase separation in the melt can occur in the form of liquid–liquid separations as well as solid–liquid separation.14,17,18 The phase separation gives rise to composition gradients in solid–liquid separation and sharp compositional interfaces in liquid–liquid separation. Different composition translates into different viscosity, and melt-chemistry, e.g., redox-potential.19,20 Compounds like Fe2O3 reduce the viscosity significantly due to depolymerization of the silicate network and increase the oxygen diffusivity by an order of magnitude.21,22 As a first approximation, we propose to understand the melt as a regime of phase transitions with microscopic areas of simple composition. The description of those, especially its viscosity and ion diffusivity, will facilitate deeper understanding of the solidification.

LiAlO2 a Potential EnAM for Lithium Recovery

The lithium aluminum oxide LiAlO2 is an early crystallizate. It has been observed to form from silicate recycling melts when aluminum is added. It bound nearly all lithium and exhibited excellent characteristics for the subsequent crushing and sorting and hence was suggested as a potential EnAM for lithium recovery.6 Flotation studies using novel collectors showed good performance of up to 89% recovery of lithium aluminate separating it from spodumene.23 High diffusivity of oxygen potentially increases the oxidation state of redox-active elements like manganese, which has a major influence on the formation of the EnAM LiAlO2.6,11 Accordingly, knowledge about the melt, e.g., diffusivity and viscosity, has the potential to predict and design compound formation in metal oxide melts. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are potent tools to study the high-temperature metal oxide properties. MD studies found that networks present in TiO2–FeO–Na2O melt significantly impact viscosity and solidification processes in slags.24 MD simulations of lithium aluminum oxides have been used to study the defect chemistry and sophisticated potentials could be developed due to the simple crystal structures and strong ionicity among ternary lithium-containing oxides.25,26 However, less attention was paid to transport properties, such as viscosity. Here, we study individual ion diffusivity and viscosity of Li–Al–O-compounds with different Li/Al ratios according to their thermodynamically predicted phase diagram. These are important properties that help to understand microscopic conditions during solidification. The selected compounds differ in the Li/Al ratio, and from lithium-rich to poor, the compound stoichiometry is Li5AlO4, LiAlO2, and LiAl5O8. The unit cells of these compounds and the pure endmembers of Li2O and Al2O3 are shown in Figure 2. The diffusivity of Li+, Al3+, and O2– and viscosity at temperatures between 1000 and 1900 K were determined using MD simulations.

Experimental and Computational Methods

Molecular Dynamic Simulations

All the MD simulations are performed with the open-source LAMMPS code.27 Periodic boundary conditions are employed, and the time step in all of the simulations is 1 fs. In the system Li2O–Al2O3, three stable lithium aluminate compounds are studied: Li5AlO4, LiAlO2, and LiAl5O8 beside Li2O and Al2O3. In the present study, charged particles interact via the long-range Coulomb potential supplemented by the short-range Buckingham potential (eq 1)1

here i and j denote an interacting pair of two ions among lithium, aluminum, and oxygen separated by a distance rij, ε0 stands for the dielectric constant. The Buckingham potential parameters are taken from Kuganathan et al.25 and are listed in Table 1. Oxygen atoms’ polarizability is included using the core–shell model,28 in which a harmonic spring connects the positive core (charge +0.8) with the negative shell (charge −2.8). The adiabatic core–shell model by Mitchell and Fincham29 is used with the CORESHELL package within LAMMPS.

The crystal structures of the five compounds at the initial state are summarized in Table 2 and shown in Figure 2. Size effects of the simulated systems are expected to be small using properly large cells and by applying periodic boundary conditions in all three dimensions. At first, the samples are relaxed at a temperature of around 300 K using an isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble for 20 ps. After relaxation of the samples, the compounds are heated up to the target temperature which is dominantly 2500 K. This high temperature was chosen to ensure that all compounds are in liquid state. At the target temperature, the samples are relaxed again for 500 ps. All visualizations as well as the analysis of the radial distribution function (RDF) and the coordination analysis are done by the software tool OVITO-PRO.30

Calphad Model

Calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) is a method that integrates experimental information, e.g., thermal and caloric material properties, phase diagram data, as well as data from atomistic modeling to establish thermodynamic models and parameters such that the Gibbs energies for respective phases for various materials systems can be predicted. Applications are for instance in the understanding of material’s microstructure and solidification predictions.37 Particularly, in terms of lithium-containing oxide material systems, CALPHAD is widely applied for calculating and predicting the phase diagrams and serves as input for nonequilibrium solidification modeling.8,12,38−42 In this work, thermodynamic models and thermodynamic database of the Li2O–Al2O3 system are applied according to Konar et al.42 Based on this, essential phase information is provided for synthesizing different lithium-containing samples.

Chemicals

Lithium hydroxide, aluminum nitrate nona hydrate, citric acid, 65% nitric acid, 25% ammonia, 95–97% sulfuric acid, and 35% hydrogen peroxide were obtained in pro analysis quality from Carl Roth. Dilutions were performed with ultrapure water (>18.2 MΩ cm, Purelab Flex 4, ELGA Veolia).

Glazed porcelain crucibles (15 mL, wide form) were purchased from IDL for the sintering of the powders. Crucibles were cleaned in boiling 10% nitric acid for 4 h and were heated to 1273 K for 2 h before usage.

Argon (99.996% purity, Linde) was used for sintering in an inert atmosphere.

Instrumentation

Powder X-ray diffraction analysis was performed with a PANalytical X’PERT PRO diffractometer with Co Kα excitation (40 kV, 40 mA) as the scatter sample in Bragg–Brentano geometry. Identification of the phases was evaluated with the PDF-2 ICDD database.43 Rietveld refinement was performed with the program package Fullprof.44

Sintering of the powders prepared by sol–gel synthesis was performed in a Nabertherm L 3/11 furnace with minimal air supply. Preparation of Li5AlO4 took place in a Naberthem LHT 02/18 furnace with automatic gas supply set to 200 L h–1 argon at 1.2 bar. Heating ramps were set for both furnaces to 10 K min–1, while cooling was limited by the furnace specifications. Microwave-assisted digestions were performed in 10 mL quartz tubes in a CEM discover SP-D 80 microwave (300 W). Digestions were carried out in triplicate with about 25 mg of substance each using a mixture of 4 mL of sulfuric acid and 0.5 mL of hydrogen peroxide. The ramping temperature was set to 473 K with a 10 min ramping time and 20 min holding time. The digestion was repeated with an additional 0.5 mL of hydrogen peroxide added. The resulting solutions were diluted to a final volume of 25 mL for inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Standard additions for aluminum and lithium, respectively, were done in order to reduce matrix effects during the determination.

ICP-OES was performed with a Varian Vista-MPX instrument equipped with a vertical quartz torch (radial plasma) with a V-gap atomizer in a PTFE chamber. Torch power was set to 1.2 kW with 15 L min–1 argon for the plasma, 1.5 L min–1 argon around the torch, as well as 0.88 L min–1 for the atomizer. Observation height was set to 12 mm with evaluation of lithium 670.78 nm and aluminum 396.15 nm lines.

Determination of the viscosity of Li5AlO4 was obtained by using a Hesse Instruments EM301 heating microscope. A 3 mm diameter cylinder of the compound with a height of 3 mm was heated to 673 K at an 80 K min–1 heating rate followed by 7 K min–1 toward the maximum temperature of 1773 K.45 The half sphere temperature was determined to be 1328 K. In another run, another cylinder of sample material was heated using the same rate as described before but with an end temperature of 1328 K, which is held for 60 min. The heights and baseline of the shadow profile were used to calculate the squared half height width of half of the profile. This value is plotted over the elapsed time, the obtained slope of 3097.1 μm2 s–1 of the linear regression R2 = 0.9439 was interpreted as diffusion coefficient D. The viscosity was then obtained using eq 2.2

In eq 2, η is the viscosity, k the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, D the diffusion coefficient, and λ is the translation distance of the diffusing ion which is always considered to be 2.8 Å, the diameter of oxygen.46−48

Compound Preparation

Synthesis of LiAlO2 and LiAl5O8 was performed with a modified Pechini method similar to Blank et al.49 Lithium hydroxide and aluminum nitrate nona hydrate in corresponding mole fractions (total amount of substance = 30 mmol) were dissolved in about 30 mL of 20% nitric acid. Citric acid in 10 mol % excess was added, and the mixture was set to a neutral pH at reflux temperature with 25% ammonia solution. Excess water was evaporated upon the self-ignition of the mixture. The resulting powders were sintered at 1273 K for 2 h in air.

Due to the increased evaporation of lithium with smaller particle sizes, the sol–gel synthesis was not suitable for Li5AlO4 as only LiAlO2 resulted. A bulk powder approach was used instead, with mixing 3.75 g (10 mmol) aluminum nitrate nona hydrate with 1.31 g (55 mmol, 10 mol % excess) lithium hydroxide. The mixture was sintered at 1023 K for 24 h in argon atmosphere.

Results and Discussion

Lithium Aluminum Oxides

With phase equilibrium thermodynamics, the eutectic composition of the Li2O–Al2O3 system is determined. By applying CALPHAD37 with a database described in previous studies,38,40,42 the eutectic composition is identified to be 0.22. Additionally, the CALPHAD modeling predicts the compounds LiAlO2 and Li5AlO4 which are formed during solidification at this certain composition. Based on this information, the synthesis procedure was set up in this work, summarized in Table 3. The compositions of Al/Li of 0.17, 0.50, and 0.83 yield the stoichiometric compounds Li5AlO4, LiAlO2, and LiAl5O8 that are selected for this study. The predicted high temperature aluminate LiAl11O17 which is found at high aluminum concentrations has no common stability zone with the EnAM LiAlO2. Additionally, an extensive study on the Li2–Al2O–3 system by De Abreu et al. found no evidence for the phase formation and decomposition of LiAl11O17 by differential thermal analysis (DTA) as well as no microstructural evidence of an eutectoid decomposition of it using Scanning Electron Microscopy.50 The compound was, therefore, not considered in the models at this point. The compounds were synthesized via the sol–gel route, as described in the experimental section. The targeted composition was evaluated by ICP-OES. The elemental balance of target and final compound are displayed in Table 3.

The elemental determination confirms the expected stoichiometries for all three compounds. The structure of the compounds was validated by powder X-ray diffraction. The diffractograms exhibit a low background and, in general, only the expected reflexes. The stoichiometry as well as the diffractogram confirm the synthesis of LiAl5O8, LiAlO2, and Li5AlO4 (Figure 3). Rietveld refinement of the obtained Li5AlO4 reveals a composition of 85.2% Li5AlO4, 6.8% LiAlO2, and 8.0% LiOH· H2O (see Figure S1). Further reflexes with minor intensities could not be assigned. The viscosity of Li5AlO4 was studied for comparison with the MD results.

Viscosity and ion diffusivity are decisive information for gaining a better understanding of the solidification of melts. The diffusivity and viscosity were calculated from MD simulations of Li5AlO4, LiAlO2, and LiAl5O8 at temperature spanning from solid state to the phase transition and the molten state. Experimentally, the viscosity and melting point of the relatively low melting compound Li5AlO4 were accessible using melt-microscopy.45 The individual ion diffusivity was exclusively available from the MD simulations. In the following section, we will describe the results obtained from MD simulations, i.e., diffusivity of the ions and viscosity of the compounds at high temperatures.

Individual Ion Diffusivity

The MD simulations allow studying the position of the individual ions Li+, Al3+, and O2– over time. The simulations were performed for all three compounds, and at the end of this subsection, ion diffusivity in all three compounds are compared. However, for a concise presentation, we mainly illustrate the results for LiAlO2, which has been already identified as potential EnAM. The corresponding illustration for the other compounds are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S2–S8). The higher the temperature, the more random the positions of the ions are. This can be illustrated by snapshots of the simulated cube and the RDF. In Figure 4, this is illustrated for LiAlO2 at 300 K, 1700 K which is close to the liquidus temperature and 2000 K which is above the liquidus temperature. The snapshots visualize the degree of disorder increasing with temperature. The RDF at 300 K exhibits the interionic distances as expected in a LiAlO2 crystal (space group P41212). The distances of the individual ion pairs are described by quite narrow distributions (see colored lines in Figure 4). At 1700 K, the distributions have significantly broadened, and at 2000 K, the RDF displays the characteristics of a liquid.

Figure 4 Structural snapshots and RDF of LiAlO2 at (a) the initial state at T = 300 K, (b) T = 1700 K, and (c) T = 2000 K.

It is visible in the RDF that some distance distributions broaden more than others with an increase in temperature. For example, the Al–O distance distribution remains relatively narrow, whereas distances between Li+ and other ions become more random. This is also seen in the RDFs of the other two compounds (Figures S3–S6). The mobility of the ions is described by their mean square displacement (MSD). It can be computed for each individual ion and then averaged over all ions of the species, and it is a measure of their diffusivity. The diffusion coefficient D is calculated from the mean-square displacement of the lithium, aluminum, and oxygen ions according to eq 3.3

In the equation, t denotes the time and the above sum is carried out over the number of ions Nion.

The MSD of all three lithium aluminum oxides at 2500 K clearly shows that Li+ is the most mobile of the ions, which is shown here for LiAlO2 and LiAl5O8 (Figure 5, for each component see S2, S4 and S7). This is well in agreement with the literature, where the lithium-ion activation energy was found being lower compared to other ions, i.e., 0.53 eV.25 Our approach allows us to determine diffusivity of all three ions during phase transition of the Li–Al–Oxides, shown here for LiAlO2 (Figure 6, for the others see S5–S8) where a rapid increase of all ions’ diffusion between 1800 and 1900 K is observed. Some results of LiAlO2 are shown in Table 4.

Li (Jacobs et al.)52	8.9	10.9	13.0	15.2

O	0	0	1.5	1.9	

These results match quite well with the simulations of Jacobs et al.52 They studied lithium diffusion in LiAlO2 with respect to its application in nuclear fusion. Here, however, we examine besides LiAlO2 the higher and lower lithiated compounds Li5AlO4 and LiAl5O8 which according to the thermodynamic model can form in lithium-ion battery recycling slags depending on the actual composition. From the MD simulations of all compounds, it is evident that the lithium ions are more mobile in the lithium-rich compounds Li5AlO4 and LiAlO2 (Figure 7). Its diffusion coefficient at T = 2500 K in the lithium-poor LiAl5O8 is only approx. one-third (D = 12 × 10–9 m2 s–1) of the one in the lithium-rich Li5AlO4 (D = 32 × 10–9 m2 s–1). The mobility of aluminum ions and oxygen ions seams to decrease with decreasing lithium content; however, this is not significant.

Figure 7 Composition dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient of Li+, Al3+, and O2– at T = 2500 K.

Losses of lithium to the gas phase have been observed during the optimization of their Li–Al–oxide compound synthesis. An enrichment of approx. 70% of lithium in the flue dust is described in the literature in a small-scale lithium-ion battery pyrometallurgical recycling approach.9 Its relatively high diffusivity may contribute to its tendency to transfer from the molten phase to the gas phase.

Viscosity Depending on Li/Al Ratio

The viscosity of the Li–Al-oxide discussed here is accessible from the diffusion coefficients obtained from the MD simulations (eq 3) using eq 2. The temperature dependence of the viscosity of the three Li–Al-oxides is shown in Figure 8 and Table 5. A strong decrease of the viscosity is observed above the liquidus temperature, which is lowest for Li5AlO4 and highest for the LiAl5O8 composition. It appears that the higher the lithium content of the melt, the lower the viscosity, which indicates that a high content of lithium promotes phase separations in the liquidus and with that can govern the formation of the solid compounds. Experimentally, the viscosity is available with high confidence for low melting Li5AlO4. It was determined to be 2.5 mPa s at 1328 K matching well the simulated viscosity at this temperature of 2.2 mPa s. The two other compounds did not show melting up to 1773 K accessible with the microscope. The shadow image of the pressed substances remained a constant size and shape at a hold temperature of 1773 K, which was held constant over half an hour. The observable high temperature behavior of the compound is in accordance with the CALPHAD and MD model. In addition to our CALPHAD prediction, this is further supported by CALPHAD-based phase equilibrium calculations conducted in ref (42). Furthermore, ref (53) confirms that the melting temperatures of the complex oxides LiAlO2 and LiAl5O8 are 2058 and 2188 K, respectively. De Abreu et al. determined peritectic melting of Li5AlO4 at 2222 K using the DTA.50

The knowledge of the melt viscosity is highly valuable, as it influences the kinetics of solidification and can contribute to phase separations. Liquidus separation into immiscible phases can be predicted based on thermodynamics, taking the enthalpy and the entropy of mixing into account. If the enthalpy of mixing is positive, a critical temperature exists below which phase separation is spontaneous. Kinetic parameters, especially the viscosity, are decisive for phase separation actually to occur. Low viscosity will quickly yield a phase separation, whereas viscous melts will separate very slowly. Phase separation in molten slags has not been described in detail on a molecular level in the literature. Liquid–liquid immiscibility, is more extensively studied as a common phenomenon in glass forming melts.18 Actually, far more binary glass forming melts exhibit liquid–liquid immiscibility than exhibit homogeneous liquid behavior.54 The shape of the immiscibility volume in the system BaO–B2O3–SiO2 was determined from experimental data.17 Though, thermodynamics predict phase separation for many glasses, due to high viscosity, those are not always observed.15,16 High viscosity hampered studying the immiscibility in the B2O3–SiO2 system.55 Once separated, the phases exhibit different compositions, melting points, ion mobility, and viscosity. Liquid–solid phase separations in a Al–Si melt were also influenced by viscosity in a way, that the adhesion of the formed Si-crystals was supported by high viscosity.56 With respect to tailor EnAMs in slag systems, knowledge of ion mobility and viscosity of the potential compounds will be a key parameter, and it can be obtained by MD simulations as shown here (e.g., Figures 7 and 8).

Individual Ion Coordination Number Depending on Composition

The experimental results agree with the findings of the simulations, which increases the confidence in the other simulated parameters at high temperatures. These are difficult to assess experimentally. The simulations can potentially yield further information on the melt structure. The mean coordination numbers are determined by extracting the positions r corresponding to the initial peaks in their respective RDF (Figure 4). One interesting observation is the increase in the mean coordination number of Li+ and Al3+ in the melt, when comparing the three compounds from high to low lithium contents. The mean coordination number of Li+ in Li5AlO4 is approx. 3 and increases to 4 in the LiAl5O8. The mean coordination number of Al3+ in Li5AlO4 is approx. 4 and increases to 5 in LiAl5O8. The coordination number in the melt can steer the structure of the solidified compound. Of course, the simulations have limitations; e.g., they do not account for elemental transitions to the gas phase. During the simulations, the number of elements is always conserved.

Conclusions

In this work, we study melt characteristics of the three stoichiometric compounds in the Li2O–Al2O3 system, i.e., Li5AlO4, LiAlO2, and LiAl5O8. Our rational is that when we learn about viscosity of certain compositions and diffusivity of the constituent ions, conclusion helping the prediction of phase separation and solidification can be derived. We have chosen the Li–Al–O system because LiAlO2 has been identified previously as a promising phase to recover lithium from lithium-ion battery recycling slags. Initially, the eutectic composition in terms of LiAlO2 and Li5AlO4 is calculated under the CALPHAD framework. We have then simulated the MD of the three stoichiometric compounds at temperatures from below to well above the liquidus temperature and determined the viscosity of each compound with increasing temperature. Additionally, we determined the diffusivity of Li+, Al3+, and O2– for each compound and at each temperature. The viscosity was well in agreement with those obtained from literature and from reference compounds synthesized by the sol–gel route. It can be concluded that Li+ already diffuses at temperatures below the liquidus. Its diffusion coefficient is about ten times higher than that of Al3+ at the melting point in, i.e., LiAlO2. This implies that the availability of Li+ is not a limiting factor in the crystal formation of Li–Al–O rich melts. The results of the MD simulations and the experiments show that the viscosity increases with a decreasing lithium content. This finding suggests that lithium rich melts are more fluid, and high lithium concentrations will promote liquidus phase separation, and it could be an interesting topic for thermodynamics in the future. In conclusion, we have gained valuable insight into the melt characteristics of the Li–Al-oxides, which will be important for understanding compound formation in slags with respect to recycling critical elements.
