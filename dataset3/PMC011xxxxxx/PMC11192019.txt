Background

Merodon equestris (Fabricius, 1794) is a large, hairy, bumblebee-mimicking hoverfly with a small head and somewhat elongate abdomen as compared to Bombus species. The species is commonly called the Large Bulb Fly or Large Narcissus Fly, as the larvae are pests of flower bulbs. It is the only species from the genus Merodon occurring in Britain ( Ball & Morris, 2015; Chandler, 2023). It can be easily identified by the clear wing, a loop in vein R4+5, black hind legs with swollen femora with a large triangular ventral projection ( Ball & Morris, 2015; Stubbs & Falk, 2002; van Veen, 2014). There are 34 colour types, e.g. thorax black or tawny haired, or tawny anteriorly and black posteriorly and abdomen with a grey, yellow, orange, whitish, buff, or red tail; or abdomen tawny-haired with a transverse black band on tergite 3 ( Conn, 1972; Stubbs & Falk, 2002).

Meredon equestris is a Palaearctic species occurring from Fennoscandia to the Mediterranean, European parts of Russia, North Africa, Japan, North America and it has been introduced to New Zealand ( Speight, 2010) and recently reported from South Korea ( Han et al., 2018). It has been recorded from Britain since 1869. It is believed to have been introduced from The Netherlands with narcissus bulbs ( Hodson, 1932). It is now widely distributed in Britain and Ireland, and can be found in gardens, urban sites and countryside, with adults on the wing from April to September ( Ball et al., 2011; Ball & Morris, 2015; Stubbs & Falk, 2002).

The larvae feed on a number of bulb-producing plant species such as Narcissus, Hyacinth, Tulipa (rarely), Amaryllis, Habranthus, Vallota, Galtonia, Scilla, Leucojum, Eurycles, the wild snowdrop Galanthus and wild bluebell Hyacinthoides non-scripta ( Fryer, 1914; Hodson, 1932). The eggs are laid on a leaf close to the ground or on a flower bulb ( Hodson, 1932; Stubbs & Falk, 2002). They hatch after approximately 10 to 15 days. The newly hatched larva is distinctively different in appearance from later stages. It usually enters the bulb through the thinner base and begins feeding. Typically, one larva is found in a bulb, and it can migrate to another bulb if the food is depleted and the bulbs are grown closely together. The larval stage lasts approximately 300 days and larva vacates the bulb in early spring, digs through the soil and pupates at the surface level or just below it. The pupal stage lasts approximately 35 to 40 days. The observed adult lifespan was between 5 and 24 days for females and 6 to 18 days for males ( Hodson, 1932). The males are aggressive in copulation and will attempt to engage with anything resembling a female, including bumblebees and other males. If successful the flies will land (if flying) and copulate on the ground ( Conn, 1971). Adults fly low, often rest on the ground, and can be encountered feeding on umbellifers ( Speight, 2017).

There is one generation per year and the species overwinters as a larva inside the plant bulb ( Conn, 1971; Hodson, 1932). The egg, larva and pupa were described by Hodson (1932), the larva was also described by Heiss ( Heiss, 1938) and was later illustrated by Rotheray (1986). The genetics of Merodon equestris colour polymorphism have been studied by Conn ( 1971; 1972; 1976).

The high-quality genome sequence described here is the first one reported for Merodon equestris. It was sequenced based on one specimen from the Eden Project, England. It will aid research on biology, phylogeny and ecology of the species. This genome has been generated as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project, a collaborative effort to sequence all named eukaryotic species in the Atlantic Archipelago of Britain and Ireland.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one Merodon equestris ( Figure 1) collected from The Eden Project in Cornwall (50.36, –4.74). A total of 33-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 44 missing joins or mis-joins and removed 5 haplotypic duplications, reducing the scaffold number by 6.21%, and increasing the scaffold N50 by 3.69%.

Figure 1. Merodon equestris (Fabricius, 1794), specimen used for genome sequencing (NHMUK014452805) a) body in latero-ventral view, head in ventral view; b) body in dorsal view, head in anterior view.

The final assembly has a total length of 873.0 Mb in 271 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 129.8 Mb ( Table 1). The snailplot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of assembly scaffolds on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (92.4%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 6 chromosomal-level scaffolds. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

A specimen Merodon equestris specimen used for DNA sequencing (specimen ID NHMUK014452805, ToLID idMerEque2) and a second specimen used for RNA (NHMUK014452803, idMerEque3) were collected at the Eden Project (latitude 50.36, longitude –4.74) on 2021-06-28 using an aerial net. These specimens were collected and identified by Olga Sivell (Natural History Museum, London) and preserved by dry freezing at –80°C. The specimen used for Hi-C sequencing (specimen ID Ox000426, ToLID idMerEque1) was netted in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire (biological vice-county Berkshire), UK (latitude 51.77, longitude –1.34) on 2020-05-22. The specimen was collected and identified by Liam Crowley (University of Oxford) and preserved on dry ice.

The workflow for high molecular weight (HMW) DNA extraction at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI) includes a sequence of core procedures: sample preparation; sample homogenisation, DNA extraction, fragmentation, and clean-up. In sample preparation, the idMerEque2 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice ( Jay et al., 2023). Tissue from the thorax was homogenised using a PowerMasher II tissue disruptor ( Denton et al., 2023a). HMW DNA was extracted using the Automated MagAttract v2 protocol ( Oatley et al., 2023a). The DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 31 ( Bates et al., 2023). Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation ( Oatley et al., 2023b): in brief, the method employs a 1.8X ratio of AMPure PB beads to sample to eliminate shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

RNA was extracted from abdomen tissue of idMerEque3 in the Tree of Life Laboratory at the WSI using the RNA Extraction: Automated MagMax™ mirVana protocol ( do Amaral et al., 2023). The RNA concentration was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and a Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit RNA Broad-Range Assay kit. Analysis of the integrity of the RNA was done using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit and Eukaryotic Total RNA assay.

Protocols developed by the WSI Tree of Life core laboratory are publicly available on protocols.io ( Denton et al., 2023b).

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Poly(A) RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the NEB Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit. DNA and RNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (RNA-Seq) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from head and thorax tissue of idMerEque1 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the HiSeq X Ten instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected using the TreeVal pipeline ( Pointon et al., 2023). Manual curation was performed using JBrowse2 ( Diesh et al., 2023), HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

The article reports about the full genome of a hoverfly species, Merodon equestris, of economic importance, since it causes pests in ornamental plants. In addition, the genus this species belongs to has a high species diversity in the Palaearctic Region, being one of the largest within the family in this biogeographical context.

The article is adequately introduced and the methods and results are explained in detail. In order to give a frame to the given detailed explanation on the species M. equestris, authors could start the Introduction with a short paragraph on the genus Merodon, addressing its taxonomic diversity and poorly known larval stages and biology (e.g. Ricarte et al, 2017). In this paragraph, they may also address to the other species of the M. equestris group found in Europe (Vujic et al, 2021).

Otherwise, the article is adequately written and complete in the information presented.
