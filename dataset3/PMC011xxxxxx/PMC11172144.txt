pmcIn the published article, there were some errors in Supplementary Figures A, B and their legend. Figure A was the wrong figure, while Figure B contained a mistake. It indicated 10 cycles in the first histograms, while the correct number is 15. The legend indicated that no significant amplification was found at 10 and 15 cycles except for actin (figure A). The correct statement is “No significant amplification was found at 10 cycles except for actin (figure A)”. The correct figures A and B and their legend appear in the updated Supplementary Material.

The authors apologize for these errors and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way. The original article has been updated.
