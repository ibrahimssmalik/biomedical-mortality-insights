Alpha waves, one of the major components of resting and awake cortical activity in human electroencephalography (EEG), are known to show waxing and waning, but this phenomenon has rarely been analyzed. In the present study, we analyzed this phenomenon from the viewpoint of excitation and inhibition. The alpha wave envelope was subjected to secondary differentiation. This gave the positive (acceleration positive, Ap) and negative (acceleration negative, An) values of acceleration and their ratio (Ap-An ratio) at each sampling point of the envelope signals for 60 seconds. This analysis was performed on 36 participants with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 23 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 29 age-matched healthy participants (NC) whose data were provided as open datasets. The mean values of the Ap-An ratio for 60 seconds at each EEG electrode were compared between the NC and AD/FTD groups. The AD (1.41 ±0.01 (SD)) and FTD (1.40 ±0.02) groups showed a larger Ap-An ratio than the NC group (1.38 ±0.02, p<0.05). A significant correlation between the envelope amplitude of alpha activity and the Ap-An ratio was observed at most electrodes in the NC group (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r = -0.92 ±0.15, mean for all electrodes), whereas the correlation was disrupted in AD (-0.09 ±0.21, p<0.05) and disrupted in the frontal region in the FTD group. The present method analyzed the envelope of alpha waves from a new perspective, that of excitation and inhibition, and it could detect properties of the EEG, Ap-An ratio, that have not been revealed by existing methods. The present study proposed a new method to analyze the alpha activity envelope in electroencephalography, which could be related to excitatory and inhibitory neural activity.

pmcIntroduction

The most characteristic activity of the cerebral cortex observed in human electroencephalography (EEG) at rest and during wakefulness are alpha waves [1, 2]. From the perspective of brain structure, alpha wave fluctuations, oscillations, have been thought to occur as cortical rhythms, or as part of a neural circuit that forms between cortices, or outside the cortex, such as in the thalamus [3–9]. Apart from the mechanism of generation, alpha wave oscillations have been variously reported to be associated with cognitive mechanisms and diseases [10–12].

In addition to the alpha oscillation itself, the amplitude of the alpha wave fluctuates, described as waxing and waning [13]. Previous researches have focused on this phenomenon [6, 14–17], but little is known about the mechanism and clinical significance of the waxing and waning of the alpha rhythm, especially in the study of EEG in patients. Although the meaning of alpha oscillations and their waxing and waning has not yet been elucidated, it has been strongly suggested that they were activities related to neural information transmission [7, 8, 18].

The rhythmic function of alpha oscillations has been suggested to have inhibitory effects on the cortex [19–21]. On the other hand, the excitatory function of alpha oscillations has also been reported, suggesting that alpha oscillations modulate the attenuation and enhancement of resting-state activity, and that alpha oscillations acted as a pacemaker for the alternation of inhibition and excitation [22]. One hypothesis concerning the timing of the inhibitory and excitatory effects of alpha oscillations, including the waxing and waning phenomenon, proposed that the rhythmicity of alpha waves mediates inhibition [19–21, 23]. Another suggested that waxing and waning resulted from the summation of multiple periodic phenomena [14]. On the other hand, Lombardi et al. [22] proposed that the waxing and waning of alpha waves in the awake resting state involved the short-term attenuation and amplification in a few alpha cycles, a few hundred milliseconds, depending on the amplitude-dependent manner [24, 25], at each peak of alpha waves [22].

The aim of the present study was to show characteristics of alpha wave fluctuation at rest, i.e. 1) the ratio of increasing and decreasing forces that form the alpha oscillation and its relationship with amplitude, and 2) the difference of these values between healthy participants and patients with dementia in whom cognitive dysfunction occurred (Fig 1). These aims were based on previous work suggesting that the waxing and waning of alpha waves is regulated in an amplitude-dependent manner [24, 25] and that this functional regulation may be disrupted in patients with dementia [26–29]. The present study assessed the moment-to-moment amplitude fluctuations rather than the periodicity of the oscillation of alpha waves. In this respect, our measurements were based on the excitatory and inhibitory functions of alpha waves reported by Lombardi et al. [22].

10.1371/journal.pone.0305082.g001 Fig 1 Illustration of the concept of the present study.

Left: Alpha wave oscillation in a cortical area forms a balance between excitation and inhibition via neural circuits with subcortical structures such as the thalamus and other cortices and networks at rest. P: cortical pyramidal cells. Top right: The waxing and waning of alpha oscillations occurs in a balance in relation to the excitation and inhibition balance of the cortical region and is transmitted as neural information. In dementia, this balance is abnormal and functional impairment occurs. Arrows indicate positive (Ap) and negative (An) accelerations, second-order derivatives in time, of the alpha envelope. Bottom right: Mathematical implication. Neural oscillator models, such as neural mass models, contain non-linear equations of oscillation. The second-order derivatives in the equations can be inhibitory or excitatory forces, the balance of which is an important element of neural function. The small black and gray balance diagram in the figure shows a balanced and imbalanced condition, respectively. We calculated the ratio of positive and negative acceleration values, Ap-An ratio, during an analysis period in the present study. We assumed that the ratio was an indicator of the balance between excitation and inhibition in the cortical region. Note: The equations are simple oscillator model equations for illustrative purposes, not equations describing the envelope of the alpha oscillation.

For the mechanisms generating alpha oscillations observed in the EEG, mathematical models, neural mass models (NMMs), have been the leading elementary models to explain the dynamics of EEG signals, from spontaneous activity to the network level [30–35]. The NMMs had properties of nonlinear oscillator models and corresponded to physiological functions at the neuronal population level [30–35]. A nonlinear oscillator model involves second-order differential equations in time, and the second-order differential equations in the NMM developed by Umehara et al. [36] well incorporated the regulation of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations.

In the present analysis, we focused on the second-order derivative with respect to time, i.e. the acceleration, which formed the envelope of the clinical EEG. We obtained the sum of the positive and negative second-order derivative values and their ratios for each of the 60 seconds of EEG. We observed whether acceleration, as a variable component of the alpha wave oscillation, differed between healthy subjects and patients as a factor involved in the envelope of the alpha wave.

Although our analysis methods were applied to conventional EEG recordings, since our analysis method involved a novel idea, we report the present results using an open EEG dataset to facilitate its validation [37–39]. The dataset contained the eyes-closed resting-state EEG recordings from a total of 88 participants, including 36 participants with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 23 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 29 healthy participants (normal control, NC). We compared the values obtained from our analysis and compared between the groups. In this study, the EEG of patients with dementia as well as that of normal participants was investigated. In addition to cognitive decline, EEG abnormalities have been reported in patients with dementia, such as disinhibition of alpha rhythm and cortical activity in participants with AD in previous studies [26–29]. The envelope analysis in this study was related to the parameters of excitatory and inhibitory control of brain activity, i.e., the variability characteristics of the envelope with respect to inhibitory and excitatory regulation of brain function [22, 36], and was expected to be able to detect the destruction of alpha activity in patients with dementia.

The term excitation-inhibition (E-I or E/I) balance, which has received much interest recently [40–42], has been used in a broad sense, from the molecular to the system level [43]. The present study assessed positive (acceleration positive, Ap value), negative (acceleration negative, An value) acceleration values and their ratio, Ap-An ratio, of the alpha wave envelope, and it might be difficult to directly approach their origin in neural mechanisms, as well as their relationship to the E-I balance used in other studies. However, we thought that the present study proposed a functional factor of the EEG related to the E-I regulation, since the alpha oscillations at rest mediated inhibitory and excitatory functions in the models [22, 36]. This study was believed that the present analysis would also allow us to detect the destruction of the function of alpha activity in various disorders.

Methods

The EEG data sets used in the present study were obtained from an open dataset [37–39]. We chose to use this open dataset because it provided stable EEG recordings during resting, awake, and closed-eye conditions in the sitting position with sufficient recording time, more than 10 minutes for each participant [37–39]. Closed-eye recording was advantageous not only to avoid blink artifacts and brain activity associated with visual stimuli and eye movements, but also to maintain a constant resting state, especially in patients with dementia. The seated position was valuable in preventing participants from falling asleep.

Participants

The dataset included resting EEG with eyes closed from 88 participants, 36 participants with AD (24 females and 12 males, mean age; 66.4 ±2.6 (SD)), 23 with FTD (9 and 14, 63.6 ±8.2), and 29 with NC (11 and 18, 67.9 ±5.4). Information of all participants was provided in S1 Table in the Supporting Information and the dataset [37–39]. A score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [44], a questionnaire used to assess the cognitive severity of dementia, was also provided for each participant in the data set, and the mean MMSE score was 17.8 ±4.5 (range; 9–23) and 22.2 ±2.6 (18–27) for the AD and FTD groups, respectively.

EEG datasets

The datasets included the EEG signals obtained from 19 electrodes, Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, and O2, according to the international 10–20 system, with 2 reference electrodes (A1 and A2) placed on the mastoids. The inter-electrode impedance was less than 5 kΩ. Each recording was made with participants in the sitting position with eyes closed. The sampling rate was 500 Hz, and the EEG signals were collected with a time constant of 0.3 seconds and a high-cut filter at 70 Hz [37–39]. The pre-processing that had already been done on the datasets were: 1) a Butterworth bandpass filter 0. 5–45 Hz, 2) the signals were referenced to the two connected mastoid electrodes, A1-A2, 3) the Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) routine, an EEG artifact correction method included in the EEGLab/Matlab software, was applied, 4) the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method was performed, transforming the 19 EEG signals into 19 ICA components, and ICA components categorized as eye artifacts or jaw artifacts by the EEGLAB platform were automatically excluded [37–39].

Selection of epochs for the present analysis

The original datasets contained more than 10 minutes for each participant. We extracted 60 seconds of EEG signals for the present study. Although preprocessing and artifact rejection algorithms for electrocardiogram and eye blink artifacts were applied to the datasets, some electrical artifacts were present, as mentioned by Miltiadous et al. [37–39], possibly due to extra-brain electrical noise or some motion artifact. Therefore, we manually selected a 60-second window without significant noise for each participant. During the manual selection of the 60-second epoch, we selected the 60-second epochs based on the following criteria: 1) electromyography (EMG) burst, 2) square-wave noise, 3) abrupt baseline shift, and 4) noise greater than 300 μV. Even if the amplitude was less than 300 μV, the waves that were considered electrical artifacts because of their shape were omitted from the epochs. The epochs selected for each participant were listed in S1 Table in the Supporting Information.

It has been reported that the envelope of alpha waves contained fluctuations with periods ranging from a few seconds to tens of seconds [14]. This study was not a frequency analysis of the envelope, but an analysis of the increase or decrease in amplitude produced by the peaks of alpha waves. As shown in Fig 2, a few peaks of the alpha envelope were obtained in 1 second, and more than several dozen peaks of the envelope were included in a 60-second period, which was considered sufficient for the present analysis. A practical reason was that even in the 10-min resting EEG recordings of each participant, there were only one or two 60-second epochs with low artifacts such as motion. Not all participants had multiple suitable continuous 60-second recordings for analysis, and we had to select a 60-second epoch from the 10-min recording, particularly for participants with dementia (S1 Table, Supporting Information).

Data analysis (Figs 2 and 3)

We used MATLAB® (MathWorks®, US) and the MATLAB®-based open-source software Brainstorm for the following analysis [45]. First, bandpass filtering between 8 and 12 Hz was applied to obtain alpha band EEG activity for 60 seconds. The peak frequency in the alpha frequency band in the power spectrum density was calculated at each electrode in each participant using Welch’s method, which divided the signals into 50% overlapping windows for each second.

10.1371/journal.pone.0305082.g003 Fig 3 Relationship between envelope amplitude and first and second-order derivatives at electrodes F4 and O2 at each sampling point in 60 seconds.

One participant was presented in each group. Each vertical axis represents the envelope amplitude and the horizontal axis represents the first (Velocity) and the second-order (Acceleration) derivatives in time of the envelope (see Fig 2D) at each sampling point. While the first derivative values were symmetrically distributed with positive and negative values for each envelope amplitude, the second-order derivative values showed an asymmetrical distribution depending on the value of the envelope amplitude. In other words, the positive second-order derivative values were larger for smaller envelope amplitudes, while the negative second-order derivative values had a similar distribution for all amplitudes. The Ap-An ratios of the NC participant were lower than those of the AD and FTD participants, regardless of the envelope amplitude. NC: normal control; AD: participants with Alzheimer’s disease; FTD: participants with frontotemporal dementia.

The baseline was offset by the signal level averaged over 60 seconds, and the signal was rectified by taking the absolute value of the sampling points. In the present study, we analyzed the amplitude of the envelope formed by the alpha wave peaks. The envelope could be plotted for positive and negative alpha wave peaks relative to the baseline. Since alpha waves have been observed as oscillations on scalp EEG [46], the positive and negative deviations of alpha waves were treated as caused by similar temporal sequences of oscillations in the present study. To obtain more temporal information about the number of peaks per unit time, the waveforms were rectified to create the envelopes.

An envelope of the time course of the alpha activity at each electrode was calculated using the MATLAB command. For the rectified alpha activity, 60 seconds was used as the magnitude of the signal to create the upper envelope. The envelope was calculated using the discrete Fourier transform as implemented in the Hilbert transform. The function first removed the mean of the amplitude of the rectified alpha activity and added it back after calculating the envelope. Each point of the envelope was determined by spline interpolation over a value at each sample point. The calculation formula for generating the envelope (g(t)) from the alpha activity (f(t)) was as follows. The MATLAB "envelope (‘peak’)" command to create an envelope included the Hilbert transform processes. h(t)=sqrt{(f(t))^2+(H(f(t))^2} (1)

g(t)=|h(t)| (2)

H; Hilbert transform, sqrt; square root, h(t); intermediate formula

The envelope of the alpha wave time course was second-order differentiated at each sampling point. We defined an absolute value of a positive and a negative value of the second-order differentiation at each sampling point as acceleration positive (Ap) and negative (An) values, respectively, and the Ap-An ratio was a ratio of Ap to An values at each sampling point. Apvalue=|positivesecond‐orderdifferentiatedvalue| (3)

Anvalue=|negativesecond‐orderdifferentiatedvalue| (4)

Ap‐Anratio=[Apvalue]/[Anvalue] (5)

The average of the Ap and An values and the Ap-An ratio for 60 seconds were obtained at each electrode. The root mean square (RMS) of the alpha activity for 60 seconds at each electrode was calculated as the envelope amplitude.

Statistical analysis

The mean envelope amplitude, peak frequency of the alpha frequency band, Ap and An values, and Ap-An ratio were calculated for all electrodes. The envelope amplitude, the Ap-An ratio, and Ap and An values were compared between groups, AD and NC, and FTD and NC groups at each electrode site.

Pearson’s correlation coefficient between envelope amplitude and Ap and An values and Ap-An ratio was compared between groups at each electrode site. The correlation between envelope amplitude and Ap and An values and Ap-An ratio between electrodes was also calculated. A p-value was calculated from each correlation coefficient. Repeated measures (for 19 electrodes) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare grand means of 19 electrodes between groups.

A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant, and the false discovery rate (FDR) or Bonferroni-Dun test was used for multiple comparisons.

Results

Although there was no significant difference in age between the three groups, the MMSE score was lower in the AD group than in the FTD group (t-test, p < 0.0001). Eighty-eight sets of EEG recordings were successfully obtained from the open source. The rectified EEG signals, the upper envelope, and the values of the first and second-order derivatives of the envelope at each sampling point were obtained (Fig 2). The relationship between the value of the first and second-order derivatives and the amplitude of the envelope at each sampling point at F4 and O2 in one participant from each group was expressed in Fig 3. Asymmetry in positive and negative values was observed in the second-order derivatives. While the first derivative values were symmetrically distributed with positive and negative values for each envelope amplitude, the second-order derivative values showed an asymmetrical distribution depending on the value of the envelope amplitude. In other words, the positive second-order derivative values were larger for smaller envelope amplitudes, while the negative second-order derivative values had a relatively similar distribution to the positive second-order derivative for all amplitudes (Fig 3). The mean amplitude expressed as root mean square (RMS) of alpha activity, the peak frequency of alpha activity for 60 seconds analyzed are shown in Table 1. The peak alpha frequency in the occipital areas, at each electrode O1 and O2 where the alpha waves were typically found [47], for each participant was shown in S1 Table in the Supporting Information. The Ap and An values and the Ap-An ratio for 60 seconds in each group are shown in Table 2.

Signal analysis in normal participants

Twenty-nine normal participants were tested first. For 19 electrodes, the Ap-An ratio (r = -0.921, p < 0.000001) was strongly negatively correlated with the mean envelope amplitude (Fig 4), and the Ap (0.920, p < 0.000001) and An (0.945, p < 0.000001) values were also strongly positively correlated with the mean envelope amplitude. For each electrode, the correlations between Ap-An ratio and mean envelope amplitude are shown in Table 3. There were significant correlations between Ap-An ratio and mean envelope amplitude at some electrodes from frontal to occipital areas in the NC group (Table 3, Fig 5). There was an asymmetry of the correlation in the frontal, central and parietal areas (Table 3, Fig 5).

The graphs are arranged from left to right, starting with the electrode with the highest value in the NC group. The Ap-An ratio was correlated with the envelope amplitude as shown in Table 3, but the order of the Ap-An ratio did not necessarily coincide with the order of the envelope amplitude.

Signal analysis in participants with dementia

Thirty-six participants with AD and 23 participants with FTD were successfully analyzed. Mean envelope amplitude, peak frequency in the alpha frequency band (Table 1), Ap-An ratio, Ap and An values (Table 2) at each electrode were presented. In the AD group, among 19 electrodes, Ap-An ratio (r = -0.306) was not correlated with envelope amplitude (Table 3), but Ap (0.946, p < 0.000001) and N (0.948, p < 0.000001) values were strongly correlated with envelope amplitude. In the FTD group, Ap-An (-0.771, 0.00011) (Table 3), E (0.734, p < 0.00001), and I (0.869, p < 0.00001) values were strongly correlated with envelope amplitude among 19 electrodes.

The mean Ap-An ratio for 19 electrodes in the AD (1.41 ±0.01 (SD)) and FTD (1.40 ±0.02) groups showed a greater Ap-An ratio than in the NC group (1.38 ±0.02, p<0.05). When comparing the mean for each electrode with a repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni-Dun test, the Ap-An ratio in the AD and FTD groups was greater than that in the NC participants with significance (p < 0.0001) (Table 2). Both the grand mean Ap and An values were greater in the AD and FTD groups than in the NC group (p < 0.0001, repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni-Dun test) (Table 2).

Correlation curves between envelope amplitude and Ap-An ratio were significantly different between NC and AD groups at FP2, F4 and C3, and between NC and FTD groups at Pz (Table 3, Fig 5). The distribution of correlation curves for 19 electrodes in each group was shown in Fig 6.

Discussion

The present study proposed a functional characteristic of the oscillation of the amplitude of alpha waves, the envelope of alpha activity. Our simple but novel analytical method found functional features of oscillations in alpha activity.

Our findings in the present study were summarized as follows: 1) the envelope of alpha activity was formed by a consistent balance between positive and negative accelerations, the Ap-An ratio, although the ratio might differ between brain regions, 2) the Ap-An ratio was negatively correlated with envelope amplitude, which might be a regulatory function of alpha activity, 3) participants with AD and FTD types of dementia showed a larger Ap-An ratio, 4) the distribution of electrodes, at which a correlation between the envelope amplitude of alpha activity and the Ap-An ratio was observed in healthy controls, was not the same in participants with dementia. These findings suggested that alpha-envelope analysis might be a potential biomarker to assess normal brain function and the underlying pathophysiology in various neurological and psychiatric disorders involving brain dysfunction.

Envelope of alpha activity and the Ap-An ratio in healthy participants

Since the participants in the present study were age-matched to the participants with dementia, we could only discuss the middle and old age of healthy participants. One of the notable findings for the envelope characteristics was that the envelope of alpha activity showed a consistent Ap-An retio. The Ap-An ratio was greater than 1, and the mean Ap-An ratio was approximately 1.38 for normal participants using the present analysis (Table 2), although the value should differ depending on the method of drawing the envelope. For a given envelope amplitude, the larger positive force was biased toward smaller envelope amplitudes, whereas the negative force appeared to be almost unbiased with respect to envelope amplitude, as shown in Fig 3. However, it remained unclear from the results of the present study whether the envelope amplitude was controlled by the Ap-An ratio, but it was suggested that the Ap-An ratio could be one of the markers characterizing the envelope amplitude.

Another finding was that the Ap-An ratio was negatively correlated with envelope amplitude in healthy participants. At a sampling point when the envelope amplitude was large, the relative negative force was greater. The amplitude of alpha waves recorded in the EEG has been considered to be the sum of multiple excitatory and inhibitory neural mechanisms, including multiple feedback processes regulated at the cortical and subcortical levels [5, 6]. Furthermore, previous studies have reported that gamma activity is associated with the inhibitory function of brain activity [48, 49]. Modulation of the envelope amplitude of alpha activity might lead to regulation via inhibitory neurons that generate gamma activity in subcortical and cortical structures and vice versa [7, 50]. In the present study, alpha wave fluctuations were analyzed, so the relationship with other frequencies was not considered. It should be noted that the alpha wave fluctuations were not only determined by the alpha waves themselves, but also by functions of other EEG frequencies [7, 50].

Because of the multiple factors involved in the excitation and suppression of the alpha oscillation, it was not possible to distinguish from the results of the present study whether the Ap-An ratio changed secondarily with the envelope amplitude or whether it was the cause of the envelope amplitude generation. However, based on the model proposed by Lombardi et al. (2023) [22], an excitatory or inhibitory function of alpha activity occurred with each peak of alpha activity, depending on the amplitude, e.g., high-amplitude alpha bursts acted as inhibitory effects. Although the present Ap-An ratio might be an indirect and macroscopic phenomenon, it could be a parameter that lead to the excitatory and inhibitory function of alpha activity. Since the alpha wave activity obtained at the scalp has been considered as the sum of modifications by different neuronal activities at the subcortical and cortical levels [4–9, 30], the correspondence with the neuronal and synaptic levels could not be discussed from the present results. However, the difference in the Ap-An ratio between the electrodes, as shown in Fig 4 suggested that there might be regional characteristics of the Ap-An ratio in relation to the envelope amplitude and the function of alpha waves.

Envelope of alpha activity and the Ap-An ratio in participants with dementia

We chose the EEG datasets provided by Miltiadous et al. [37–39] and compared the Ap-An ratio between healthy participants and participants with dementia, in which the alpha oscillations associated with the excitatory and inhibitory functions might be destructed [26–29, 51]. The present results showed a larger Ap-An ratio in the participants with dementia than in the healthy participants, suggesting that there were brain regions where the control of alpha wave amplitude differed between normal participants and patients with dementia. In the previous studies, using transcranial magnetic stimulation [26], an invasive method [29] and network analysis [27, 28, 48], showed disinhibition of cortical activity in the patients with dementia, and Martínez-Cañada et al. [52] reported the hyperexcitability in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by analyzing their excitation/inhibition ratio from the power spectrum and 1/f slopes of resting state EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Given that amplification of alpha waves caused an inhibitory function [19–21], the greater Ap-An ratio in dementia patients than in normal participants, which induced an increase in alpha waves, could result in a compensatory phenomenon that attempted to increase the alpha waves, although it might be unable to increase alpha wave activity in the degenerated brain. The present method of calculating the Ap-An ratio made it possible to assess the functional state of the alpha waves at each electrode or in each brain region in order to compare the regional characteristics or pathology in different diseases, as shown below in the cases of FTD.

In the FTD group, the destruction of the Ap-An ratio was limited to the electrodes in the temporal region, whereas in the AD group, the Ap-An ratio was greater than that of the NC group from the parietal to the occipital region in addition to the temporal region (Table 2). When the correlation between envelope amplitude and Ap-An ratio was compared between the NC and FTD groups, it was lost in frontal and the temporal (T6) electrode areas in the FTD group, and correlated only in occipital and temporal (T5 and T6) areas in AD (Table 3). We assumed that the difference in electrode areas showing destruction of the Ap-An ratio would depend on the type and progression of the disease. Since the MMSE score was higher in the FTD group than in the AD group, the difference in the distribution of the Ap-An ratio could simply be related to the severity of the dementia, as shown between the MCI and AD groups in the previous study [52]. At the same time, however, we thought that the disruption of the Ap-An ratio might also characterize the type of dementia. Occipital areas were relatively preserved in morphology in AD [53], and frontal atrophy was one of the features in FTD [54, 55]. Although 19-channel EEG recording could not determine a specific relationship between an electrode and a brain region, electrodes with loss of significant correlation between envelope amplitude and the Ap-An ratio were not inconsistent with the pathologies in AD and FTD. We had to mention that the MMSE scores were different, higher in the FTD group than in the AD group. The difference in memory and cognitive functions simply resulted in the difference between the AD and FTD groups. Further studies with participants with AD and FTD with similar MMSE scores are needed to clarify the relationship between the Ap-An ratio and decline in brain function.

Since we were able to demonstrate the difference in the alpha envelope between the NC group and the AD/FTD groups, it was suggested that the alpha envelope and the Ap-An ratio could be neurophysiological markers to detect and evaluate brain function related to E-I regulation.

Limitations

In the present study, we considered the second-order derivative with respect to time of the alpha wave envelope fluctuation as a factor characterizing the envelope waveform and investigated whether it could be related to brain dysfunction. Although the relationship with previous mathematical models was considered, this study was approached from the clinical EEG analysis. We did not consider a direct correspondence with the NMMs or their equations in the present report, but a mathematical model to explain this phenomenon should also be considered. The correspondence with the pathophysiology of the neural activity occurring was not clear, as was the physiological implication. It would be necessary to verify inductively the characteristics and changes of the alpha envelope by evaluating it in different pathological conditions. As for findings in normal participants, this study used only participants with a limited age range over the late 40s. Senile changes may be mixed in the NC group. Aging and developmental effects, gender differences, dominant hand effects, etc. should be considered in further studies to determine the normal alpha envelope characteristic. Intra-individual variation and the presence or absence of task-related changes in the envelope should also be clarified. Because the analysis in this study was novel, better variations in analysis windows and envelope generation methods might need to be developed for better analysis in future studies. We expected that measurements in various pathological conditions would clarify the meaning of the envelope. Although many future studies are needed, we believed that a new method with envelope analysis, as found in the present study, could be potentially useful for evaluating brain activity.

Conclusion

We conducted the present study a new method of analyzing the envelope of alpha activity of the EEG. The Ap-An ratio of the alpha activity envelope in the present study, which might related with inhibitory and excitatory functions of alpha oscillations, could be a useful biomarker to assess brain function, although this novel analysis method did not involve a high degree of complexity. As shown in the present results, the envelope amplitude analysis could provide new insights into brain activity in normal participants and participants with dementia. We believe that the envelope of alpha activity should be studied not only in healthy individuals, but also in various brain disorders, including functional disorders that did not show abnormalities in clinical EEG reading.

Reviewer #1: General Comment:

I thank the authors for the opportunity to review this work. The amount of work put into this research is evident. For this reason, I hope to offer suggestions which will increase the effectiveness of the paper.

The paper offered an interesting new technique to evaluate EEG-based alpha activity within the human brain – one in which has not been thoroughly explored before. Although the paper was communicated coherently overall, minor specifications were missing which impact the reproducibility of the work. For that reason, I have highlighted these recommended changes along with some minor comments for the author to consider, for the work to be more impactful overall.

Abstract:

The abstract covers most of the necessary components in order to summarize the research but could have been a bit more quantitative in nature. Providing the supporting quantitative results would help solidify the significance of the findings and would render the paper as more impactful overall.

Page 2 – The abstract states that alpha waves are “the major components of cortical activity in the electroencephalography (EEG)”. Although this is not completely incorrect, I believe it to be critical to state that this is in reference to waking human brain activity. For instance, it is well established that during resting states, lower frequency bands (i.e., delta and theta) dominate neural activity in the brain, therefore this distinction is necessary.

Introduction:

The introduction provided a good balance of background knowledge and rational for the research. A few minor comments on the introduction include:

Page 7 – Line beginning with “the waxing and waning” - while introducing such concepts it, would be helpful if the authors provided more details on “the summations of multiple dynamics”.

Page 10 – The introduction ended very strongly. The authors were very clear in what their aims were, what the paper entailed, and the implications of the work.

Methods:

The methodology was presented in a logical structure, although was missing a few minor details. Further details are required on the following:

Page 10 – Please state why the authors opted to use eyes closed data.

For instance, the choice of using eyes closed EEG data is a great one as it avoids the need to discriminate neuronal signals associated with mechanisms of visual processing and oculomotor artifact (such as eye-blinks and eye-movements). For this reason, it would be of great value if the authors stated this, along with any other reasons why eyes closed data were used.

Page 12 section 2.2 – Please state why only 60 seconds of EEG data were evaluated.

Page 12 sections 2.2 – Specify which key features were involved in this selection process. In other words, please state which markers of noise were evaluated.

Page 12 – data analysis sections should be denoted as section 2.3.

Page 12 sections 2.3 – Were the peak alpha frequencies evaluated on an individual basis, e.g., in the form of the Individual Alpha Peak Frequency (IAPF)? If so, please specify. If not, please indicate why IAPFs were not used.

Page 13 section 2.3 - Please state the process involved in the signals being rectified.

Additionally, it would be helpful stating the purpose/why EEG rectification was used. This would ultimately allow the research to be more well received and applied to a wider audience (i.e., by those who may not be as familiar with EEG-based research and terminology).

Page 13 section 2.3 - Which MATLAB command was used? If this is in reference to Fourier Transform, please specify.

Page 14 section 2.3 – Please clarify why “An I value was originally a negative value, but in

this study an I value was expressed as a positive value”.

Page 14 section 2.4 – A minor note, but I would suggest changing the phrase “at each electrode” to “at each electrode site” as the former refers to a single electrode whereas the latter refers to all electrodes at a single scalp location (e.g., electrode site F3, etc.).

Discussion:

I commend the authors on the work, as the findings seem novel and were fascinating to learn about. In order to more accurately represent the value of the findings, I recommend the following minor alterations of the discussion section:

Page 18 – I recommend putting all limitations and future work in a section toward the end of the discussion, as this would allow the findings to be presented in a stronger and more convincing manner.

Page 19 section 4.1 – When discussing the findings, I suggest tying them in with previous work which may be similar in concept (even if not of similar methodology, but of similar underlying neuronal mechanism). Doing so would strengthen this section, and thereby further substantiating the findings of this study.

Page 19 section 4.1 – Regarding the sentence: “That is, the excitatory force or second derivative that increased the amplitude was, on average, greater than the force that decreased the amplitude.” - What does this indicate on a neural level?

Page 20 section 4.1 – “Since both E and I were positively correlated with amplitude, a region of higher mean envelope amplitude, resulting from higher amplitude alpha activity, had more inhibitory than excitatory power operating.” – What are the implications of this finding, more specifically, in relation to healthy participants?

Page 21 section 4.1 – “the present study, we might observe that excitatory and inhibitory components or factors in one frequency band, i.e., the alpha frequency band, resulted from the effects of other frequency bands” – Well noted and a strong end to this section.

Page 22 section 4.2 – “We thought that this alpha envelope analysis method allowed us to evaluate the E-I ratio from a temporal sequence of the alpha rhythm obtained at a region or electrode.” – I suggest adding a point or two to this sentence as to why the authors believed this, as a means of strengthening the statement.

Page 22 section 4.2 – “less in the number of electrodes” – are the authors referring to less in all of the electrodes or specific electrodes. If the latter, please specify which electrodes this is in reference to.

Page 22 section 4.2 – “this result could simply related with the severity of dementia” – it would strengthen this statement if a previous research was used to substantiate this assumption. Are there any underlying mechanisms which could further support this statement?

Page 24 section 4.2 – “Further studies with participants with AD and FTD with similar MMSE scores are needed to clarify the relationship between the E-I ratio and deterioration of brain

function.” – Great concluding sentence.

Conclusion:

The conclusion was clear and concise, and very effective overall. With that said, I recommend moving the limitations section to before the conclusion section as I believe this would increase the effectiveness of the work by ending on a positive note.

Page 24 – the phrase "quite simple" downplays the method, making it seem less strong overall. I would suggest rephrasing this to something along the lines of "Although, this novel analysis method does not involve high degrees of complexity..", as the value of the work is presented in a more convincing and persuasive manner.

Figures:

Figure 1 – “Methods of analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals.” I would recommend changing this to “ A representation of the method of analysis” as this figure supports the methodology, but is not the “method” per se.

I appreciate this opportunity to review this work and hope that the constructive feedback will be of benefit to the Authors.

Reviewer #2: In this study, the authors investigate the link between the phenomenon of waxing and waning amplitude in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz) and the E/I (excitation/inhibition) ratio. This research goal is pursued by first extracting the envelope of the 8-12 Hz band-pass filtered signal. Consequently, the second derivative of the envelope was extracted, assuming that negative values corresponded to a higher influence of inhibitory populations, while positive values to be driven by excitatory ones. As a practical example: in this study, a higher E/I ratio is equivalent to a steeper increase of the amplitude in the alpha frequency range. The differences with respect to these parameters, and its relevance to clinical populations of patients with AD and FTD is then used as a benchmark for these EEG quantitative metrics.

Although the subject of this study is currently of great interest, I would recommend that the authors address a few major points before publication. After a brief summary of my suggestions and comments, I will detail every comment, referring to the exact manuscript line (where possible).

Authors assume that the waxing and waning of alpha frequency amplitude is driven by a dynamic disequilibrium in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory populations, irrespective of which cortical/subcortical region we are subjecting to investigation; they make this assumption by advancing that ERP studies support this view. However, it is my personal opinion that this claim needs stronger evidence. From my point of view, providing more literature that backs up this claim is at least necessary to improve the quality of the manuscript. In an ideal case, authors might want to establish their claims by providing evidence in a computational model: as they don't make any region-specific claim, I think that a neural mass model should be sufficient in this case. Without these precautions, I believe that the authors' claims are not really supported by the data presented, which also makes it very difficult to intepret their clinical results even for an expert reader.

In the manuscript, there is also some missing information that I think are very important for a thorough understanding of their work, but I'm confident that authors can fill in the gaps very quickly.

Major issue: at the current state, it's really hard to confirm that the authors' assumptions and results are backed up by the data presented. Because of this, I would suggest a few steps before publication:

- provide, at least in the introduction, literature supporting the validity of using the second derivative of the alpha frequency envelope as a proxy measure to the E/I ratio;

- ideally, showing this link in a computational model (I would suggest using a neural mass model) is a major key point is solidifying this work's results.

- addressing the minor issues, which will be detailed in the next paragraph, citing the exact manuscript page where possible.

Introduction

- page 8: "In the case of evoked

potentials, the increase or decrease in amplitude of the components was

considered to be the sum of excitation and inhibition processes that occurred

prior to the generation of the wave. Such excitation and inhibition could be

considered not only for afferent neural signals evoked by external stimuli,

but also for intrinsic neural activity, e.g., neural activity producing alpha

waves, at the cortical and subcortical levels." Reference is needed here, even if the study was already cited in the previous paragraphs.

- page 10: "We believe that this study was conducted using a new method

with potential future applications." claims of novelty are not really necessary in the introduction. However, this is my personal view and I haven't found anything against it in the journal's editorial guidelines, which makes it not really necessary to address.

Methods

- page 11. How many ICs were rejected, on average? and is there a reason for not using a CAR rereferencing before ICA?

- page 12. I'm not really sure of why a 60s window was selected for all EEG recordings. It's my understanding that the reason is probably related to too many artifacts present in these datasets, but can you elaborate more on this?

- page 13: if I'm not mistaken, authors use "differentiated" to indicate derivatives. I might be wrong, and I apologize if that's the case, but it would be better to mantain a certain degree of consistency when using technical jargon.

- page 14. Some important details are missing in the description of the statistical methods used here. In order: which statistical test did you use to compare the metrics presented here? which type of correlation did you apply (Pearson, Spearman's, etc...)? how was significance for the correlation computed?

Results

- page 15. Maybe MMSE (mini mental state exam) needs to be introduced before the results.

Discussion

- page 19, "The mean E-I

ratio was 1.38 for normal participants using the present analysis". Is this value comparable to what has been found in other studies, even if they used different methods?

- page 19, "These results suggested that the waxing and waning of the alpha envelope was regulated by a pattern of balance between excitatory and inhibitory forces." In light of my earlier comments, I would suggest to advance these claims only if the link between E/I ration and alpha amplitude are clarified.

- page 20 I'm not sure of what "balistic" means, in this context. Please clarify.

- page 21, " In the present study, we might observe that

excitatory and inhibitory components or factors in one frequency band, i.e.,

the alpha frequency band, resulted from the effects of other frequency bands." I'm not really sure of this sentence's meaning. It would be very kind of the authors if this could be rephrased to improve readabilty.

Figures

Please write titles for each part of the figure, as for instance in Figure 2's graphs. As of now, it's really hard to follow what's depicted in the figures.

Responses to the reviewers

First I would like thank you very much for your thoughtful review. We have revised the manuscript extensively, as far as we could, according to the reviewer’s suggestions. Revised parts of the manuscript were typed in red.

Major revisions are:

1) Introduction has been fully revised. We have described the background of the analysis method used in this study, the mathematical model involved, and why we chose this analysis method. All descriptions of poorly related evoked brain responses have been removed.

2) The term "E-I ratio" used in the previous version has been changed to "Ap-An ratio" to avoid confusion of the readers, since the previous E and I values were not identical with the excitation and inhibition functions of alpha waves, but only values for second derivatives of the alpha envelope in time.

3) The Discussion sections have also been extensively revised by adding sentences about previous related studies and studies of neural models.

Reviewer #1: General Comment:

I thank the authors for the opportunity to review this work. The amount of work put into this research is evident. For this reason, I hope to offer suggestions which will increase the effectiveness of the paper.

The paper offered an interesting new technique to evaluate EEG-based alpha activity within the human brain – one in which has not been thoroughly explored before. Although the paper was communicated coherently overall, minor specifications were missing which impact the reproducibility of the work. For that reason, I have highlighted these recommended changes along with some minor comments for the author to consider, for the work to be more impactful overall.

Abstract:

The abstract covers most of the necessary components in order to summarize the research but could have been a bit more quantitative in nature. Providing the supporting quantitative results would help solidify the significance of the findings and would render the paper as more impactful overall.

Response: We have revised the abstract to include quantitative results. Values with significant difference have been added in the abstract.

Page 2 – The abstract states that alpha waves are “the major components of cortical activity in the electroencephalography (EEG)”. Although this is not completely incorrect, I believe it to be critical to state that this is in reference to waking human brain activity. For instance, it is well established that during resting states, lower frequency bands (i.e., delta and theta) dominate neural activity in the brain, therefore this distinction is necessary.

Reply: We agreed that your points were important. We revised the sentences. The first sentence of the Introduction has also been revised.

(Abstract)

Alpha waves, one of the major components of resting and awake cortical activity in human electroencephalography (EEG), are known to show waxing and waning, but this phenomenon has rarely been analyzed.

(Introduction)

The most characteristic activity of the cerebral cortex observed in human electroencephalography (EEG) at rest and during wakefulness are alpha waves [1,2].

Introduction:

The introduction provided a good balance of background knowledge and rational for the research. A few minor comments on the introduction include:

Page 7 – Line beginning with “the waxing and waning” - while introducing such concepts it, would be helpful if the authors provided more details on “the summations of multiple dynamics”.

Response: We have added sentences in Introduction by adding a reference.

From the perspective of brain structure, alpha wave fluctuations, oscillations, have been thought to occur as cortical rhythms, or as part of a neural circuit that forms between cortices, or outside the cortex, such as in the thalamus [3-9]. Apart from the mechanism of generation, alpha wave oscillations have been variously reported to be associated with cognitive mechanisms and diseases [10-12].

Page 10 – The introduction ended very strongly. The authors were very clear in what their aims were, what the paper entailed, and the implications of the work.

Thank you for your comment. Most of Introduction has been revised, but the last sentence has been retained.

Methods:

The methodology was presented in a logical structure, although was missing a few minor details. Further details are required on the following:

Page 10 – Please state why the authors opted to use eyes closed data.

For instance, the choice of using eyes closed EEG data is a great one as it avoids the need to discriminate neuronal signals associated with mechanisms of visual processing and oculomotor artifact (such as eye-blinks and eye-movements). For this reason, it would be of great value if the authors stated this, along with any other reasons why eyes closed data were used.

Response: Thank you for your thoughtful comments. We have added sentences to explain why we chose the closed eye data at the beginning of the section.

We chose to use this open dataset because it provided stable EEG recordings during resting, awake, and closed-eye conditions in the sitting position with sufficient recording time, more than 10 minutes for each participant [33-34]. Closed-eye recording was advantageous not only to avoid blink artifacts and brain activity associated with visual stimuli and eye movements, but also to maintain a constant resting state, especially in patients with dementia. The seated position was valuable in preventing participants from falling asleep.

Page 12 section 2.2 – Please state why only 60 seconds of EEG data were evaluated.

Response: Thank you for your important comment. We have added an explanation to the section 2.3., although it is a bit lengthy. We have also added sentences about the methods in the Limitations section. Since the present analysis was novel, better variants in terms of analysis methods, including analysis window and envelope creation methods, may need to be developed in further studies.

(In the section 2.3. Selection of epochs for the present analysis)

It has been reported that the envelope of alpha waves contained fluctuations with periods ranging from a few seconds to tens of seconds [14]. This study was not a frequency analysis of the envelope, but an analysis of the increase or decrease in amplitude produced by the peaks of alpha waves. As shown in Fig 1, a few peaks of the alpha envelope were obtained in 1 second, and more than several dozen peaks of the envelope were included in a 60-second period, which was considered sufficient for the present analysis. A practical reason was that even in the 10-min resting EEG recordings of each participant, there were only one or two 60-second epochs with low artifacts such as motion. Not all participants had multiple suitable continuous 60-second recordings for analysis, and we had to select a 60-second epoch from the 10-min recording, particularly for participants with dementia (S1 Table, Supporting Information).

Page 12 sections 2.2 – Specify which key features were involved in this selection process. In other words, please state which markers of noise were evaluated.

Response: We have added sentences in the section 2.3.

Although preprocessing and artifact rejection algorithms for electrocardiogram and eye blink artifacts were applied to the datasets, some electrical artifacts were present, as mentioned by Miltiadous et al. [33-35], possibly due to extra-brain electrical noise or some motion artifact. Therefore, we manually selected a 60-second window without significant noise for each participant. During the manual selection of the 60-second epoch, we selected the 60-second epochs based on the following criteria: 1) electromyography (EMG) burst, 2) square-wave noise, 3) abrupt baseline shift, and 4) noise greater than 300 µV. Even if the amplitude was less than 300 µV, the waves that were considered electrical artifacts because of their shape were omitted from the epochs. The epochs selected for each participant were listed in S1 Table in the Supporting Information.

Page 12 – data analysis sections should be denoted as section 2.3.

Response: Section numbers have been removed, according to the journal format.

Page 12 sections 2.3 – Were the peak alpha frequencies evaluated on an individual basis, e.g., in the form of the Individual Alpha Peak Frequency (IAPF)? If so, please specify. If not, please indicate why IAPFs were not used.

Response: We measured the peak alpha frequency at each electrode in each participant. We have revised the sentence in the section 2.4. Although the mean peak frequency at each electrode is shown in Table 1, we have added the value of the peak alpha frequency at the occipital area, at O1 and O2 electrodes, in the table in the Supporting Information.

The peak frequency in the alpha frequency band in the power spectrum density was calculated at each electrode in each participant using Welch's method, which divided the signals into 50% overlapping windows for each second.

The mean amplitude expressed as root mean square (RMS) of alpha activity, the peak frequency of alpha activity for 60 seconds analyzed are shown in Table 1. The peak alpha frequency in the occipital areas, at each electrode O1 and O2 where the alpha waves were typically found [47], for each participant was shown in S1 Table in the Supporting Information.

Page 13 section 2.3 - Please state the process involved in the signals being rectified. Additionally, it would be helpful stating the purpose/why EEG rectification was used. This would ultimately allow the research to be more well received and applied to a wider audience (i.e., by those who may not be as familiar with EEG-based research and terminology).

Response: We have added sentences for explanation of the process and reason.

The baseline was offset by the signal level averaged over 60 seconds, and the signal was rectified by taking the absolute value of the sampling points. In the present study, we analyzed the amplitude of the envelope formed by the alpha wave peaks. The envelope could be plotted for positive and negative alpha wave peaks relative to the baseline. Since alpha waves have been observed as oscillations on scalp EEG [46], the positive and negative deviations of alpha waves were treated as caused by similar temporal sequences of oscillations in the present study. To obtain more temporal information about the number of peaks per unit time, the waveforms were rectified to create the envelopes.

Page 13 section 2.3 - Which MATLAB command was used? If this is in reference to Fourier Transform, please specify.

Response: Recent MATLAB have provided command for envelope, and we used one of the commands for envelope calculation.

[yupper, ylower] = envelope (x, n, ‘peak’)

envelope(x) returns the upper and lower envelopes of the input sequence x as the magnitude of its analytic signal. The envelope(x, n, 'peak') command returns the peak envelopes of the sequence signal. The envelopes are determined using spline interpolation over local maxima separated by at least n samples. The analytic signal of x is found using the discrete Fourier transform as implemented in the "hilbert" command. The function first removes the mean of x and then adds it back after calculating the envelopes.

Since we calculated the Ap and An values at each sample point, we did not average the signal, i.e. n=1 in the command, to create the envelope.

These sentences can be found in the MATLAB tutorial, we have added a sentence about the MATLAB command we used.

The MATLAB "envelope (‘peak’)" command to create an envelope included the Hilbert transform processes.

Page 14 section 2.3 – Please clarify why “An I value was originally a negative value, but in this study an I value was expressed as a positive value”.

Response: Since the negative acceleration values were defined as An values, the original An values were all negative. Since the Ap-An ratio is a ratio of the magnitude of excitation and inhibition, a positive or negative sign is not meaningful. The description of the positive and negative signs is misleading, so the description has been changed to clarify the values.

The envelope of the alpha wave time course was second differentiated at each sampling point. We defined an absolute value of a positive and a negative value of the second differentiation at each sampling point as acceleration positive (Ap) and negative (An) values, respectively, and the Ap-An ratio was a ratio of Ap to An values at each sampling point.

Ap value = | positive second differentiated value | (3)

An value = | negative second differentiated value | (4)

Ap-An ratio = [ Ap value ] / [ An value ] (5)

The average of the Ap and An values and the Ap-An ratio for 60 seconds were obtained at each electrode. The root mean square (RMS) of the alpha activity for 60 seconds at each electrode was calculated as the envelope amplitude.

Page 14 section 2.4 – A minor note, but I would suggest changing the phrase “at each electrode” to “at each electrode site” as the former refers to a single electrode whereas the latter refers to all electrodes at a single scalp location (e.g., electrode site F3, etc.).

Response: the phrase has been changed as you could suggest.

The envelope amplitude, the Ap-An ratio, and Ap and An values were compared between groups, AD and NC, and FTD and NC groups at each electrode site.

Pearson's correlation coefficient between envelope amplitude and Ap and An values and Ap-An ratio was compared between groups at each electrode site.

Discussion:

I commend the authors on the work, as the findings seem novel and were fascinating to learn about. In order to more accurately represent the value of the findings, I recommend the following minor alterations of the discussion section:

Page 18 – I recommend putting all limitations and future work in a section toward the end of the discussion, as this would allow the findings to be presented in a stronger and more convincing manner.

Response: We have moved the sentences to the Limitation section at the end of the manuscript. The sentences in the Limitation section have been extensively revised.

Page 19 section 4.1 – When discussing the findings, I suggest tying them in with previous work which may be similar in concept (even if not of similar methodology, but of similar underlying neuronal mechanism). Doing so would strengthen this section, and thereby further substantiating the findings of this study.

Thank you very much for your important comment. We have completely revised the introduction and provided methodological background. The discussion of the envelope of alpha activity and the Ap-An ratio in healthy participants has also been extensively revised to show previous studies with related concepts.

Page 19 section 4.1 – Regarding the sentence: “That is, the excitatory force or second derivative that increased the amplitude was, on average, greater than the force that decreased the amplitude.” - What does this indicate on a neural level?

This sentence has been deleted. The reason was that the average of the magnitude of the acceleration does not necessarily equal the sum of the applied forces.

Page 20 section 4.1 – “Since both E and I were positively correlated with amplitude, a region of higher mean envelope amplitude, resulting from higher amplitude alpha activity, had more inhibitory than excitatory power operating.” – What are the implications of this finding, more specifically, in relation to healthy participants?

This sentence was also deleted because its meaning was ambiguous. The discussion on healthy people has been substantially revised.

Page 21 section 4.1 – “the present study, we might observe that excitatory and inhibitory components or factors in one frequency band, i.e., the alpha frequency band, resulted from the effects of other frequency bands” – Well noted and a strong end to this section.

Thank you for your comment, but we have revised the sentences according to the other reviewer’s comment.

In the present study, only alpha wave fluctuations were analyzed, so the relationship with other frequencies was not considered. It should be noted that the alpha wave fluctuations were not only controlled by

Reviewer #1: I first would like to commend the authors for the improvement in the manuscript. With that said, I believe there to be a view minor points to address before being ready for acceptance. These are the following:

Abstract:

Line 34-39: I strongly recommend breaking the sentence up into two to increase readability. E.g., Second sentence starting line 37 "This was done in 36....."

Highlights:

Line 71: I recommend changing the starting of the second point so it varies slightly from the first (i.e., not starting with "a new" once again.

Introduction:

Line 91-98: Very well improved!

Line 105-108: Once again, a bit difficult to read. I recommend re-structuring/ splitting into two sentences.

Line 114: Move this to the sentence after, e.g., by stating "Such aims were based upon previous work, which defines.... (then state where it is based upon).

Line 136: I would move this to the discussion/limitation section as keeping it in the introduction weakens the argument of the current exploration.

Line 167: This sentence comes off weak. Perhaps saying "This study is believed...." rather than "thought". A minor recommendation but wording does strengthen the argument of the work to the reader!

Methods:

The authors have put in evident work to drastically improve the methods section, making it a lot more cohesive and sound. With that stated, I highly recommend adding some visual support (e.g., figures or diagrams) which support the research/analysis. As the concepts explore are fairly complex in nature, I strongly believe a visual component will strengthen receptivity of the work immensely.

I hope that these minor suggestions help improve the manuscript further beyond the already evident improvement!

Reviewer #2: All comments were adequately addressed by the authors.

I would like to thank the authors for the patience taken to revise their work. I also suggest, as a future direction, to investigate the mechanisms underlying the acceleration/deceleration of the envelope in the alpha band, as it might provide an interesting window into neural activity.

Responses to the reviewers

Thank you very much for your very thoughtful peer review.

We have again revised the manuscript carefully according to the reviewer’s comments. In particular, we have added a diagram illustrating the concept of this study.

Reviewer #1: I first would like to commend the authors for the improvement in the manuscript. With that said, I believe there to be view minor points to address before being ready for acceptance. These are the following:

Abstract:

Line 34-39: I strongly recommend breaking the sentence up into two to increase readability. E.g., Second sentence starting line 37 "This was done in 36....."

The sentence has been revised.

The alpha wave envelope was subjected to secondary differentiation. This gave the positive (acceleration positive, Ap) and negative (acceleration negative, An) values of acceleration and their ratio (Ap-An ratio) at each sampling point of the envelope signals for 60 seconds. This analysis was performed on 36 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 23 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 29 age-matched healthy participants (NC) whose data were provided as open datasets.

Highlights:

Line 71: I recommend changing the starting of the second point so it varies slightly from the first (i.e., not starting with "a new" once again.

The highlight #2 has been changed.

#2: From the perspective of excitatory and inhibitory regulation, a novel aspect of cortical alpha oscillations was proposed

Introduction:

Line 91-98: Very well improved!

We would like to thank the reviewers for their help.

Line 105-108: Once again, a bit difficult to read. I recommend re-structuring/ splitting into two sentences.

The sentence has been revised and split into two sentences.

One hypothesis concerning the timing of the inhibitory and excitatory effects of alpha oscillations, including the waxing and waning phenomenon, proposed that the rhythmicity of alpha waves mediates inhibition [19-21,23]. Another suggested that waxing and waning resulted from the summation of multiple periodic phenomena [14].

Line 114: Move this to the sentence after, e.g., by stating "Such aims were based upon previous work, which defines.... (then state where it is based upon).

The sentences have been revised.

The aim of the present study was to show characteristics of alpha wave fluctuation at rest, i.e. 1) the ratio of increasing and decreasing forces that form the alpha oscillation and its relationship with amplitude, and 2) the difference of these values between healthy participants and patients with dementia in whom cognitive dysfunction occurred. These aims were based on previous work suggesting that the waxing and waning of alpha waves is regulated in an amplitude-dependent manner [24, 25] and that this functional regulation may be disrupted in patients with dementia [36-39].

Line 136: I would move this to the discussion/limitation section as keeping it in the introduction weakens the argument of the current exploration.

We have moved part of the sentence into the section of limitation.

(In Limitations)

We did not consider a direct correspondence with the NMMs or their equations in the present report, but a mathematical model to explain this phenomenon should also be considered.

Line 167: This sentence comes off weak. Perhaps saying "This study is believed...." rather than "thought". A minor recommendation but wording does strengthen the argument of the work to the reader!

Thank you for your suggestion. The sentence has been revised.

This study was believed that the present analysis would also allow us to detect the destruction of the function of alpha activity in various disorders.

Methods:

The authors have put in evident work to drastically improve the methods section, making it a lot more cohesive and sound. With that stated, I highly recommend adding some visual support (e.g., figures or diagrams) which support the research/analysis. As the concepts explore are fairly complex in nature, I strongly believe a visual component will strengthen receptivity of the work immensely.

We have added a figure which illustrated an overview the method of the present study.

I hope that these minor suggestions help improve the manuscript further beyond the already evident improvement!

Thank you again for your detailed peer review.

Reviewer #2: All comments were adequately addressed by the authors.

I would like to thank the authors for the patience taken to revise their work. I also suggest, as a future direction, to investigate the mechanisms underlying the acceleration/deceleration of the envelope in the alpha band, as it might provide an interesting window into neural activity.

Thank you for your kind comments. Thanks to your suggestions, we have been able to improve the manuscript. We will proceed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon and develop a mathematical model.
