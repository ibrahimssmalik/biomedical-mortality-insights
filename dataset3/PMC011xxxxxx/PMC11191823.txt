This article was previously published with an error.

The protocol mistakenly indicated that the study will use block randomisation (instead of simple randomisation) to assign clusters. This error went unnoticed and is contrary to the simple randomisation approach implemented by the study. This has been corrected in Concealment of sequence generation and Randomisation section of Assignment of interventions under Methods and analysis.
