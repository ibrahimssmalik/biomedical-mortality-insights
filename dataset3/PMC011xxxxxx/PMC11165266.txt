﻿Abstract

Over the course of revising the genus Rinorea (Violaceae) from Colombia, field observations and herbarium studies revealed seven new species. Several of the new species described here belong to species complexes that required examination of herbarium material from across the Neotropics. Each of the new species described here have oppositely arranged leaves and belong to Rinoreasect.Pubiflorae, a section restricted to the Neotropics. Two new species are segregated from the R.ovalifolia species complex: Rinoreachiribiquetensis from Chiribiquete National Park in the Colombian Amazon and Rinoreastevensii from the Orinoco River near the border of Colombia and Venezuela. Two new species are segregated from the Rinoreahirsuta species complex: Rinoreagaleanoae-bernalii and Rinoreacogolloi, both from the eastern slopes of the Andean Central Cordillera along the mid-Magdalena River Valley in Colombia. From the widely distributed R.pubiflora species complex, we segregated one new species, Rinoreacallejasii, from southeast Panama and the Chocó in Colombia. In addition to these five new taxa segregated from widely distributed species complexes, we discovered two previously unknown species with affinities to other Neotropical Rinorea. Rinoreaaymardii is described from the Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve in Venezuela and most closely resembles R.melanodonta from Colombia. Rinoreabetancurii is segregated from R.macrocarpa and occurs in the Amazonian Regions of Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Venezuela. In this study, we provide descriptions, illustrations and distribution maps of the new species and make preliminary assessments of the risk of extinction using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. We also furnish an identification key to the species of Rinoreasect.Pubiflorae in Colombia.

The genus Rinorea Aubl. has a pantropical distribution and is the second largest genus in the Violaceae after Viola (Ballard et al. 2014). It is composed of 225–275 species of shrubs and trees with ca. 30 species in Asia, 115–155 species in Africa, 24 species in Madagascar and, in the Neotropics, where species of Rinorea typically occur in lowland rainforests, 47 species and two infraspecific taxa are currently recognised (Hekking 1988; Wahlert and Ballard 2009; Wahlert 2010; Marquete Ferreira da Silva and Medeiros 2012; Oliveira and de Queiroz 2020). They are often locally common shrubs and treelets of the forest understorey and frequently co-occur with other species of Rinorea (ter Stegee 2013).

In his taxonomic treatment of Neotropical Rinorea, Hekking (1988) classified the species into one of two groups: Super Group I ‘Apiculata’ and Super Group II ‘Rinorea.’ The three species in Super Group I ‘Apiculata’ were segregated into the genus Bribria Wahlert & H.E. Ballard, based on morphological, anatomical and molecular phylogenetic evidence (Wahlert et al. 2017; Wahlert and Ballard 2012; van Velzen et al. 2015). Hekking divided Super Group II ‘Rinorea’ into three groups: Group IIa ‘Rinorea,’ Group IIb, ‘Uxpanapana,’ and Group IIc ‘Pubiflora’ Hekking (1988). Wahlert et al. (2017) established these groups as taxa: Group IIa was recognised as Rinoreasect.Rinorea and includes all Neotropical Rinorea with alternately arranged leaves, Group IIb was segregated into the genus Ixchelia H.E. Ballard & Wahlert, with two species from Mexico and Mesoamerica and Group IIc was recognised as Rinoreasect.Pubiflorae Wahlert & H.E. Ballard and includes all Neotropical Rinorea with oppositely arranged leaves. The seven new species described in this study all belong to R.sectionPubiflorae, which is endemic to the Neotropics.

The present study was undertaken as part of a revision of Rinorea for Colombia. However, because several taxa are allied to widely distributed complexes, we examined specimens from across the Neotropics, from Mexico to Brazil and the Caribbean. We employed many of the same traits used by Hekking (1988) to circumscribe taxa and we found that previously overlooked characters of lamina venation are also useful in delimiting some species of Rinorea. The venation characters used in this study include details of the patterning of primary and tertiary veins and the spacing and angle of attachment of the secondary veins to the mid-vein, amongst others. In addition to three species discovered since Hekking’s (1988) monograph, the seven new species described here bring the total number of taxa in Rinoreasect.Pubiflorae to 44 (41 species and three infraspecific taxa). The 13 remaining Neotropical species, all with alternate leaves, belong to R.sect.Rinorea.

﻿Materials and methods

Field collections were made in lowland tropical rainforests in Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru, from 0–500 m elevation. All available herbarium material was examined from BHO, COAH, COL, F, FAUC, GH, HUA, JAUM, MEDEL, MO, NY, TOLI, UBDC and US (herbarium acronyms according to Thiers (2023)). Several digitised herbarium collections and records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) were consulted to locate duplicate specimens for the following Herbaria: AAH, CM, FMB, G, INPA, K, MA, MBM, MG, MICH, RB, P, U and VEN. All cited collections have been seen by the first author. Species descriptions are based primarily on field observations and herbarium specimens. When available, flowers from herbarium specimens were rehydrated before dissection and measurement. A digital caliper and dissecting stereoscope were used to measure indument, flowers, fruits and seeds.

Leaf laminae were cleared to study venation architecture. Leaves were placed in a glass container and submerged in 1–5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The NaOH solution was changed every 1–2 days during the clearing process, which took 8–10 days. Leaves were then washed in a 50% Clorox® solution followed by a final wash in water to stop the bleaching process. Staining was made with safranin for 5–8 minutes and then the leaves were put through a dehydration series in 50%, 95% and 100% ethanol (Ellis et al. 2009). The cleared leaves were photographed with a digital camera using a scale bar.

Post-factum georeferences for specimens lacking coordinates were assigned using either Google Earth or Tropicos specimen records with the same collecting localities. Collections lacking unambiguous locality information were omitted from the conservation assessment calculations. The online GeoCat facility (Bachman et al. 2011) was used to calculate the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and Area of Occupancy (AOO) of each species to preliminarily estimate the risk of extinction using IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012); a 2 × 2 km cell was used for calculating AOO.

Distribution and habitat.

Rinoreacallejasii is restricted to the Caribbean coast of Colón and San Blas Provinces, Panama and the Pacific coast of Chocó Department, Colombia, a region belonging to the biogeographic Province of Chocó-Darien in the Pacific Dominion (sensuMorrone (2014)). It occurs in lowland humid rainforests at elevations of 30–500 m. (Fig. 2)

Etymology.

Rinoreacallejasii honours Dr. Ricardo Callejas Posada, Professor of Biology at Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia. Prof. Callejas has made many contributions to the taxonomic knowledge of the Piperaceae and expanded the understanding of the diverse flora of Colombia, especially in the Department of Antioquia. He was the major advisor of SEHG.

Phenology.

The species flowers January through March; specimens in fruit were collected in March and May.

Conservation status.

Rinoreacallejasii has a geographic range in the form of an EOO of 40,729 km2 and AOO of 52 km2. In Panama, it is represented by two locations within Chagres National Park and one location in Soberanía National Park. Outside of the protected areas, where the species exists at nine locations, it is threatened by the exploitation of natural resources, mineral extraction and energy development. In Colombia, it is represented by two locations, both outside protected areas. The species does not meet the criteria necessary to assign a threatened status. However, given ongoing habitat disturbance, it is likely that the species will qualify in the near future for a threatened status and, thus, it is preliminarily assessed with a status of “Near Threatened” (NT).

Notes.

Rinoreapubiflora, as circumscribed by Hekking (1988), was morphologically variable across its large distribution in the Neotropics. He recognised a variety of R.pubiflora: var.grandifolia (Eichler) Hekking, which was further divided into two forms: f.grandifolia and f.andersonii (Sandwith ex Hekking) Hekking. Rinoreacallejasii is a segregate of R.pubifloravar.pubiflora s.s. In attempting to explain the morphologically divergent specimens of var. pubiflora from Panama (e.g. G. C. de Nevers et al. 5075), Hekking (1988) invoked a scenario of hybridisation between R.squamataS.F.Blake andvar.pubiflora. However, our analysis of morphological divergence and biogeographic distribution suggest that R.callejasii is a separately evolving lineage from the nominate species (sensuDe Queiroz (2008)) and deserving of recognition as a new taxon at the rank of species.

Rinoreacallejasii is sympatric with four other taxa of Rinorea. Rinoreasquamata and R.hirsuta Hekking can be differentiated by their single glabrous seed per valve (vs. two glabrous seeds per valve in R.callejasii). Rinoreadasyadena is distinguished by its two pubescent seeds per valve and asymmetrical lamina base (vs. two glabrous seeds and symmetrical lamina base). Rinorealindenianavar.fernandeziana can be separated by its one pubescent seed per valve (vs. two glabrous seeds per valve).

Distribution and habitat.

Rinoreaaymardii, which is only known from the type specimen, occurs the Alto Orinoco–Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve in Amazonas State, Venezuela, a biogeographic area classified as the Province of Imerí in the Boreal Brazilian Dominion (sensuMorrone (2014)). It grows in terra firma humid forest at elevations of 100–180 m. The landscape of the type locality is characterised by gently sloping (10–20%) hills composed of granitic and quarzitic rocks (Aymard 2000). (Fig. 4)

Etymology.

Rinoreaaymardii honors the Venezuelan botanist Gerardo Aymard, who has made significant contributions to the taxonomic knowledge of the flora of Venezuela, especially the south-western part of the country in the Río Negro and Orinoco River Basins.

Phenology.

The species is only known from one flowering specimen collected in February.

Conservation status.

Rinoreaaymardii has a geographic range in the form of an EOO of 4 km2 and AOO of 4 km2. It is currently known only from the type collection, which represents one location within the terra firma forests of the Alto Orinoco–Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve in Venezuela where it is threatened by illegal logging and mining. Based on its limited AOO, the single location and the projected continuing decline in the quality of habitat due to uncontrolled deforestation and resource extraction, the species might be preliminarily assigned to the “Critically Endangered.” However, given the difficulty accessing this inadequately explored area, it is likely there are additional occurrences that would allow a more accurate assessment of the risk of extinction than is possible at this time. The species is therefore preliminarily assigned to the IUCN (2012) Category of “Data Deficient” [DD].

Notes.

Rinoreaaymardii is sympatric with R.macrocarpa from which it can be differentiated by the smaller lamina 4–11 × 1–2.7 cm with crenate margins (vs. larger lamina 5.5–21.5 × 2–9.2 cm with subentire to subcrenate margins in R.macrocarpa), filaments free (vs. filament fused into a tube) and style filiform (vs. style conical).

Etymology.

Rinoreachiribiquetensis is named for the Chiribiquete National Park in Colombia.

Phenology.

The species is only known from one flowering specimen collected in December.

Conservation status.

The region encompassing the vast and remote Chiribiquete National Park is relatively little explored as evidenced by the scarcity of collections in the Tropicos database (https://www.tropicos.org; accessed 25 February 2023), GBIF (https://www.gbif.org; accessed 25 February 2023) and other Colombian Herbaria (e.g. COAH, COL, HUA). There are insufficient data to assess the risk of extinction of Rinoreachiribiquetensis and, therefore, the species is preliminarily assigned to the IUCN (2012) category of “Data Deficient” [DD].

Notes.

Rinoreachiribiquetensis is sympatric with R.macrocarpa, but it can be differentiated by the presence of domatia (vs. domatia absent in R.macrocarpa), smaller lamina, 3.2–4.2 × 1.6–3.6 cm (vs. larger lamina, 5.5–21.5 × 2–9.2 cm), filaments free (vs. filaments fused into a tube) and style filiform (vs. style conical). Rinoreachiribiquetensis can be differentiated from R.stevensii by the smaller lamina, 3.2–4.2 × 1.6–3.6 cm (vs. larger lamina, 4–12.5 × 2.5–7 cm in R.stevensii) and less dense pubescence on the abaxial lamina surface, with trichomes 0.2–0.3 mm long (vs. denser pubescence on the lamina, with trichomes 0.4–0.5 mm long).

Distribution and habitat.

Rinoreastevensii occurs in Colombia in the border region with Venezuela near the Orinoco River and in El Tuparro National Park. It also occurs in Venezuela in the vicinity of Puerto Ayacucho. This distribution corresponds to the Biogeographical Provinces of Pantepui and Sabana, in the Boreal Brazilian and Pacific Dominions, respectively (sensuMorrone (2014)). The species grows on granitic hills and slopes in lowland semi-deciduous tropical rainforests and savannahs, at elevations of 85–520 m. (Fig. 6)

Etymology.

Rinoreastevensii is named in honour of Dr. Peter Stevens, Professor of Biology at the University of Missouri Saint-Louis and curator of the Missouri Botanical Garden. Prof. Stevens was the major advisor for SEHG’s master’s degree.

Vernacular names.

Aruni yó (B. M. Boom et al. 6564).

Conservation status.

Rinoreastevensii has a geographic range in the form of an EOO of 5,070 km2 and AOO of 56 km2. It is represented by two locations within the El Tuparro National Park in Colombia and eight locations outside of protected areas in Venezuela where it is threatened by deforestation, illegal resource extraction and uncontrolled fires. Based on its limited AOO, the number of locations and the projected continuing decline in the quality of habitat, the species is preliminarily assigned to the “Vulnerable” category [VU B2ab(iii)].

Notes.

Based on several morphological differences and an allopatric distribution, Rinoreastevensii is segregated from R.ovalifolia (as circumscribed by Hekking (1988)). Hekking noted the variable morphology of some specimens now representing R.stevensii, but he was unsure of their placement: “The leaves of Rinoreaovalifolia are variable in character, e.g. the underside of the leaves varies from densely hispidulous to glabrescent and domatia may be present or not”. Hekking invoked introgressive hybridisation between R.ovalifolia and R.pubifloravar.pubiflora to explain the morphological variability, but we disagree with his opinion. We hypothesise that the distinctive morphological characteristics and the discrete biogeographic distribution suggest that R.stevensii is a separately evolving lineage (sensu De Queiroz (2007)) making it worthy of recognition at the rank of species. Key morphological differences amongst R.stevensii, R.ovalifolia and R.pubifloravar.pubiflora are presented in Table 1.

Table 1. Key morphological differences among R.stevensii, R.ovalifolia, and R.pubiflora.

Seeds per valve	2	2	3	

In addition to an allopatric distribution, Rinoreastevensii can be differentiated from R.chiribiquetensis (the other species segregated from R.ovalifolia) by several morphological characters. It has longer and more abundant pubescence on the lamina, with trichomes 0.4–0.5 mm long (vs. shorter and less abundant pubescence on the lamina, with trichomes 0.2–0.3 mm long in R.chiribiquetensis), larger lamina, 4–12.5 × 2.5–7 cm (vs. smaller lamina, 3.2–4.2 × 1.6–3.6 cm) and larger petals 2.8–4.3 × 1.2–1.9 mm (vs. 3–3.3 × 1.4–1.6 mm). Rinoreapubifloravar.pubiflora co-occurs with R.stevensii, but it is differentiated by having three pubescent seeds per valve, whereas R.stevensii has two glabrous seeds per valve.

Distribution and habitat.

Rinoreacogolloi is narrowly distributed in Antioquia Department, Colombia, an area that coincides with the Biogeographical Province of Magdalena in the Pacific Dominion (sensu Morrone 2014). The species grows in lowland tropical rainforests in a region characterised by a karstic topography, occurring at elevations of 30–500 m. (Fig. 9)

https://binary.pensoft.net/fig/1061199

Etymology.

Rinoreacogolloi is named in honour of Professor Alvaro Cogollo who has made contributions to the knowledge of Magnoliaceae taxonomy and the flora of Colombia, especially the middle Magdalena River Valley, where the species is endemic.

Phenology.

The species flowers between August and December; fruiting specimens were collected in February and August through October.

Conservation status.

Rinoreacogolloi has a geographic range in the form of an EOO of 1,641 km2 and AOO of 32 km2. It is currently known from eight locations outside of protected areas. The region, underlain by karstic rocks, is heavily impacted by limestone extraction for concrete production and uncontrolled deforestation for grazing, agriculture and logging. Another location in north-eastern Antioquia Department is threatened with gold mining and deforestation. Given the high demand for cement products, the generally poor management of forest resources in the area and the number of locations, we project a continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat for the species. Rinoreacogolloi is preliminarily assigned to the “Vulnerable” category [VU B1+B2ab(iii)] in accordance with the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012).

Notes.

Hekking (1988) noted the aberrant lamina pubescence of several specimens of Rinorealindeniana (e.g. A. Cogollo 786, 1075, 1483). Rinoreacogolloi and R.lindeniana share several characteristics, such as leaf venation architecture and asymmetrical lamina bases, but R.cogolloi is readily separated from R.lindeniana by the densely pubescent indument on the abaxial lamina surface (vs. the abaxial lamina surface pilose to glabrescent in R.lindeniana). Rinoreacogolloi occurs sympatrically with R.galeanoae-bernalii (see below), but R.cogolloi has densely pubescent indument on the abaxial lamina surface (vs. abaxial lamina surface glabrescent in R.galeanoae-bernalii), pubescent fruit with spreading, erect ferruginous trichomes 0.3–0.4 mm long (vs. densely tomentose fruit) and the seeds pubescent with erect ferruginous trichomes 0.3 mm long (vs. seeds glabrous). Rinoreacogolloi and R.hirsuta have been confused by the similarity of the leaves and indumenta, but they can be differentiated by the asymmetrical lamina base, thyrsoid inflorescence, dorsal gland pubescent, pubescent seeds and capsule asymmetrical and pilose. In addition, these two species have different distributions, with R.cogolloi occurring in the Magdalena Province and R.hirsuta restricted to the Chocó-Darien Province (sensu Morrone (2014)). Rinoreacogolloi is also similar to R.pubifloravar.pubiflora, but it can be differentiated by its valves containing one seed (vs. valves containing three seeds in R.pubiflora) and the thyrsoid inflorescence (vs. racemose inflorescence). Table 2 highlights the key morphological differences amongst these five species.

Distribution and habitat.

Rinoreagaleanoae-bernalii is apparently endemic to Colombia, where it occurs in the Departments of Antioquia, Caldas and Santander. Its distribution corresponds to the Biogeographical Province of Magdalena in the Pacific Dominion (sensuMorrone (2014)). It grows in lowland tropical rainforest at elevations of 192–500 m. (Fig. 9)

Etymology.

Rinoreagaleanoae-bernalii is named in honour of the late Dr. Gloria Galeano Garcés (1958–2016) and Dr. Rodrigo Bernal, a husband-wife botanical team who contributed greatly to the knowledge of the Colombian flora and the taxonomy of Neotropical palms, Cyclanthaceae and Marantaceae. As professors and mentors, they inspired many of their students to pursue a botanical career studying the flora of Colombia.

Phenology.

The species flowers between July and October; fruiting specimens were collected in January, April, July and September through November.

Conservation status.

Rinoreagaleanoae-bernalii has a geographic range in the form of an EOO of 9,409 km2 and AOO of 48 km2. It is known from 11 locations that are not included in any protected area. The locations in the middle Magdalena River Valley are heavily impacted by deforestation for grazing and agriculture, especially for cultivation of Elaeisguineensis (oil palm), while some known locations in Antioquia Department are threatened with limestone extraction for concrete production. Given ongoing habitat disturbance and projected continuing decline in the quality and extent of habitat, it is likely that the species will qualify in the near future for a threatened status and, thus, it is preliminarily assessed with a status of “Near Threatened” (NT).

Notes.

Hekking noted the unusual glabrous lamina in at least one specimen which he had identified as Rinoreahirsuta (e.g. E. Rentería et al. 1779). Based on the discrete biogeographic distributions of R.galeanoae-bernalii and R.hirsuta (Magdalena Valley vs. Chocó-Darien, respectively) and the morphological characters that differentiate the two (e.g. the presence of a staminal tube and the patterns of pubescence on the anther connectives and style), we hypothesise that R.galeanoae-bernalii is a separately evolving lineage worthy of recognition at the rank of species.

Rinoreagaleanoae-bernalii is sympatric with R.cogolloi, but it can be differentiated by the racemose inflorescence and glabrous seeds (vs. thyrsoid inflorescence and pilose seeds in R.cogolloi). Rinoreagaleanoae-bernalii is also sympatric with R.pubifloravar.pubiflora, but it can be differentiated by the valves that each contain one glabrous seed (vs. valves that each contain three pubescent seeds in R.pubifloravar.pubiflora); see Table 2 for a comparison of key diagnostic characters differentiating R.galeanoae-bernalii, R.cogolloi and R.pubifloravar.pubiflora.

Description.

Rinoreabetancurii is similar to R.macrocarpa by the elliptic lamina lacking domatia, lamina base symmetrical and capsule symmetrical with apex acuminate, but it differs by the abaxial lamina surface pubescent (vs. abaxial lamina surface glabrous in R.macrocarpa), lamina base obtuse (vs. lamina base cuneate), fruit smaller 2.5–3 cm long (vs. fruit larger, 3–5.7 cm) and valves containing two pubescent seeds (vs. valves containing three glabrous seeds).

Treelets 1.5–5 m tall, branchlets with puberulent erect ferruginous trichomes 0.1–0.2 mm long, glabrescent.

https://binary.pensoft.net/fig/1061201

Distribution and habitat.

Rinoreabetancurii occurs in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, an area that corresponds to the Biogeographic Provinces of Imerí and Pantepui in the Boreal Brazilian Dominion (sensuMorrone (2014)). The species grows in lowland tropical rainforest at elevations of 60–170 m. Rinoreabetancurii has been recorded as growing in sandy soils near rivers and on slopes and hills. (Fig. 4)

Etymology.

Rinoreabetancurii honours Julio Betancur, Colombian botanist and curator at the National Herbarium in Bogotá. Dr. Betancur has inspired a new generation of students to pursue a career in botany and has made many contributions to the taxonomic knowledge of the Bromeliaceae, Heliconiaceae and the flora of Colombia.

Phenology.

Fruiting specimens were collected in February through May and in September, November and December.

Conservation status.

Rinoreabetancurii has a geographic range in the form of an estimated EOO of 511,480 km2 and an AOO of 36 km2. The species is known from eight localities, none of which appear to be in protected areas. Based on satellite imagery from Google Earth, the locations in Colombia and Brazil appear to be heavily impacted by deforestation, while the four Venezuelan locations are in remote and vast primary forests with large buffers from disturbed areas. Even though we project continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat for the Colombian and Brazilian locations, the undisturbed forests in southern Venezuela appear to be safe from large-scale disturbance for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, it appears unlikely that the species will qualify for a threatened status in the near future and is assigned a preliminary status of Least Concern (LC).

Notes.

Rinoreabetancurii occurs with R.pubifloravar.pubiflora, but it can be separated by the valves that contain two seeds (vs. valves that contain three seeds in R.pubifloravar.pubiflora).
