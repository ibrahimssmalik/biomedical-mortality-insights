pmc1. Introduction

1.1. General Introduction

Transportation has been crucial in driving growth and development throughout human history [1,2]. The development of the wheel, advances in marine transportation, the Industrial Revolution with its breakthrough steam engine technology, and later inventions, such as electricity and internal combustion engines, are all key milestones that represent substantial improvements [3,4]. Today, transport sciences comprise a wide range of disciplines, such as transport engineering, logistics and transport packing, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, vehicle engineering, computer science, and economics [5,6,7,8].

It is critical to address three primary transportation disciplines: land transportation, air transportation (including space travel), and water transportation. These disciplines interact and play important roles in many subdisciplines of transportation. On the other hand, pipeline transport functions differently and is primarily concerned with the flow of gas and oil rather than passenger transit. This is why pipeline transport is not addressed in this context.

In each of these fields, significant considerations such as sustainability, ecological operation, and economics must be considered [9,10,11].

This article will examine rail transportation, especially focusing on railway sleepers, and will pay dedicated attention to concrete structures reinforced by plastic fibers (see Section 1.2).

Before describing the particular field of the article, the authors would like to discuss general topics as introductory themes. The paper is mainly related to civil engineering; however, other engineering disciplines (e.g., mechanical engineering, material engineering, and technologies) are also being brought as appropriate and connecting fields.

In the case of traditional ballasted railway permanent ways, their structure consists of the superstructure, i.e., rails, sleepers, rail fasteners (fastening system), ballast bed with its subballast, and the substructure, i.e., granular protection layer (formation layer or protection layer) and the subgrade [12,13,14,15,16]. In European terminology, subballast refers to the lower layer of the ballast bed beneath the sleepers; in American terminology, however, subballast is synonymous with the formation layer and is classified as part of the substructure. The elements of the layer structure constitute a (force) support system in which vertical and horizontal loads (forces) are distributed according to a given distribution law.

1.2. Railway Sleepers

Railway sleepers, which are crucial for constructing and maintaining railway tracks, provide essential support and stability for the safe operation of trains [17,18]. Historically, materials like wood, concrete (mainly reinforced concrete—i.e., RC), steel, and synthetics have offered unique benefits [17,18]. Reinforced concrete sleepers can increase the load-bearing capacity of structures, simultaneously decreasing deformation due to loading and the crack width in the concrete [19]. The railway companies’ experiences with these reinforced structures are favorable [20].

The current paper deals with pre-stressed reinforced concrete railway sleepers with and without additional plastic fiber reinforcement. Concrete sleepers are favored for their durability and low maintenance and are particularly suitable for high-speed rails. Reinforced with steel rods or fibers, reinforced concrete sleepers offer improved strength and resilience and are ideal for areas with heavy loads and temperature extremes. Fiber-reinforced sleepers combine the benefits of reinforced concrete with additional strength and maintenance efficiency, making them suitable for high-stress areas.

Adding extra fiber reinforcement to steel-reinforced concrete sleepers represents a major advancement in railway infrastructure. This review compiles findings from various studies, highlighting how fiber reinforcement affects the performance of concrete sleepers. Each statement reflects the organized content from the provided dataset to ensure precision and thoroughness.

The studies investigated different materials for sleepers, including recycled chopped carbon fiber and epoxy resin [21], pre-stressed concrete with CFRP (Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer) [22], and synthetic fiber-reinforced concrete [23]. Other studies looked at materials like laminated form carbon [24] and steel-reinforced concrete [25]. These varied materials underscore the broad exploration of fiber reinforcement in enhancing sleeper properties.

The fibers used in these studies included carbon fibers, synthetic fibers, and hybrid mixes of steel and polypropylene fibers [21,22,23,25]. Carbon fibers are popular for their high strength and stiffness [21]. The quantity of fibers varied, with some studies optimizing the content to 2 wt% carbon fiber for the best results [21], while others tested amounts like 2.0 kg/m3 and 5.0 kg/m3 [23]. This variation was crucial in identifying the most effective reinforcement levels.

The main methodologies involved lab experiments to evaluate the mechanical and dynamic properties of sleepers. These included flexural strength tests, rail seat static positive moment tests, and dynamic damping assessments [21,22,23,24,25]. The studies aimed to reduce vibration and noise issues [21], compare modal and harmonic responses [22], and assess flexural tensile strength [23]. For instance, tests on CFRPC sleepers aimed to mitigate vibration and noise problems [21].

Comparative studies were vital, contrasting fiber-reinforced sleepers with traditional steel-reinforced ones. The results consistently showed that fiber reinforcement significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of concrete sleepers. CFRPC sleepers, for example, demonstrated better flexural strength and reduced vibration compared to conventional sleepers [21]. Similarly, CFRP-reinforced, non-pre-stressed sleepers performed similarly to pre-stressed B70-type sleepers [22]. Adding synthetic fibers to concrete greatly improved its mechanical properties, like flexural tensile strength [23].

Incorporating additional fibers into concrete sleepers provided many benefits. Enhanced durability and strength were common themes [21,22,23,25]. Adding fibers like synthetic and carbon fibers increased resistance to cracking and improved load-bearing capacity [23]. Polypropylene fibers, for example, contribute to better energy absorption and distribution during impact, which is crucial for the longevity and safety of railway infrastructure [24]. Another study found that LCR-6 sleepers with additional fiber reinforcement performed better than conventional sleepers [25].

Despite these benefits, challenges with fiber reinforcement remain. One major issue is the complexity of manufacturing, which could increase production costs [23]. Ensuring even the distribution of fibers within the concrete matrix is critical for consistent performance, requiring precise mixing and placement techniques [22]. Additionally, the long-term performance and environmental impact of synthetic fibers need further study [24]. The main conclusions from the study on LCR-6 sleepers indicated that adding fibers significantly improved performance, although manufacturing complexities were noted [25].

Table 1 contains the results of a very detailed literature review with more considered aspects [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49].

1.3. Identification of the Research Gap and the Structure of the Current Paper

The review of the current literature highlights a notable gap in the study of plastic fiber reinforcement in (pre-stressed) steel-reinforced concrete railway sleepers (see Section 1.1 and Section 1.2). While many studies have explored high-strength fibers like carbon and polypropylene, the potential benefits of plastic fibers have been largely overlooked. There is also a lack of comprehensive comparisons and long-term performance data for sleepers reinforced with plastic fibers. This research aims to address these gaps by performing thorough laboratory tests and numerical modeling to assess the mechanical properties and overall performance of plastic fiber-reinforced sleepers. By doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and durability of using plastic fibers in railway sleeper construction.

The current paper is the so-called continuation of the authors’ previous publication [19]. The main aim was to investigate a unique plastic fiber-reinforced pre-stressed concrete railway sleeper in the laboratory and in sophisticated finite element (FE) software, namely ABAQUS. The entire examination is founded on the procedure in which the behavior of the above-mentioned unique sleeper is compared with the same product without plastic fiber reinforcement. It should be mentioned that the basis for pre-stressed reinforced-concrete sleepers were the L4-type standard sleepers manufactured by the MABA Hungária Ltd. (Hungary) in Várpalota [50,51] the unique sleepers received additional plastic fibers. All specimens (sleepers) were fabricated following the standard (and daily used) factory production control of MABA Hungária Ltd. The authors executed several laboratory tests (bending tests in the vertical plane) supplemented by DIC measurements, and the experiments were modeled using finite element software to obtain more profound insight. Based on the experimental investigations and numerical modeling, the behavior of the different setups and structures could be compared, and the effects of plastic fiber reinforcement could be evaluated.

Section 2 details the materials and methods, Section 3 contains results and discussion, and Section 4 summarizes the study’s main conclusions.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Materials

2.1.1. Details of the Pre-Stressed Sleeper

The employed sleepers were designed with a length of 2600 mm and featured a variable cross-sectional area. The concrete utilized for sleeper construction adhered to the commonly used C50/60 concrete grade specifications, while the reinforcing steel for the sleepers was specified as high-strength steel (as outlined in Section 3). Figure 1 illustrates the sleeper specimen, delineating its geometric dimensions and reinforcement details. Expressly, the sleeper incorporated six ∅5 mm stirrups (B550B) on its sides (∅ means the diameter), and it was longitudinally reinforced with eight ∅6 mm pre-stressed bars (Ap 160/180) to withstand tensile forces.

The concrete sleeper MABA L4 SV 60 railform with a Vossloh System W14 rail fastening system was prepared at the same time as the specimens (for which rail system and with which rail reinforcement system it was prepared is not relevant for the laboratory tests performed), both in normal (regular) and fiber-reinforced design, intended for laboratory tests.

A total of 5056 g of plastic fiber (SIKA HPP50) was used to manufacture the fiber-reinforced concrete sleepers (mixed with 0.8–0.9 m3 of concrete per sleeper).

The finished railway sleepers (structural test) and for the cylindrical specimens (hardened concrete test) were delivered to the Building Materials and Structural Testing Laboratory of the Széchenyi István University of Győr after 28 days of hardening.

Regarding tests on hardened concrete specimens, the splitting-tensile strength of cylinder specimens and the compressive strength of cylinder specimens taken during the production of reinforced concrete sleepers for railway construction were tested. These tests were necessary to establish a suitable material model for the subsequent finite-element model and to simulate reality, which can be used to verify the laboratory structural tests. The test results are introduced and detailed in Section 2.1.2 and Section 2.1.3.

2.1.2. Compressive Strength of Cylinder Samples

Compressive strength tests of cylinder samples (determination of the tensile strength of hardened concrete, according to MSZ EN 12390-6 [52]) were carried out. The results are shown in Table 2.

Explanation of the symbols:RTV reference, compressive strength after storage in water.

The results showed that the fci,test (compressive strength of cylinder samples) values for reference sleepers were, on average fci,test,reference = 78.9 N/mm2, while for synthetic fiber-reinforced sleepers fci,test,fiber-reinforced = 75.8 N/mm2, no significant differences were found in the determination of this value.

Young’s moduli (E) for reference (without fiber reinforcement) and fiber-reinforced concrete were determined from graphs constructed from the measurement results and calculated values. The average Young’s modulus for the reference footings was Ereference = 37,825 N/mm2, while for the fiber-reinforced cross-sleeper, Efiber-reinforced = 35,925 N/mm2.

2.1.3. Splitting-Tensile Strength of Cylinder Samples

The authors performed the splitting-tensile strength of cylinder samples according to the MSZ EN 12390-3:2019 [53] standard requirements. The results obtained during the studies are shown in Table 3.

Explanation of the symbols:RBV reference, splitting-tensile strength after storage in water.

As before, reference and synthetic fiber-reinforced cylinder samples were prepared for this test. The authors calculated fcti,sp,test (splitting-tensile strength of cylinders). For reference specimens, the mean splitting-tensile strength was fcti,sp,test,reference = 5.3 N/mm2, while for synthetic fiber-reinforced cylinder samples, the mean value was fcti,sp,test, fiber-reinforced = 4.6 N/mm2.

The results presented in Table 2 and Table 3 served as input parameters for determining the concrete-material parameter of the finite-element model.

2.2. Methods

2.2.1. GOM Aramis DIC Measurement System

The GOM Aramis Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system is a sophisticated tool designed for precise measurement and analysis in the field of materials and structural testing. This innovative system utilizes digital image correlation technology to provide accurate, non-contact 3D deformation and strain measurements on various objects and surfaces.

At its core, the GOM Aramis DIC system employs high-resolution cameras to capture a sequence of test object images, typically marked with a random speckle pattern. This pattern allows the software to track and analyze the surface deformation accurately. When the object is subjected to mechanical stress, the cameras continuously record its surface, capturing even the smallest deformations and strains.

The strength of the GOM Aramis system lies in its versatility and precision. It can be used in a wide range of applications, from material testing and component testing to validating numerical models in research and development. The system provides valuable insights into material properties, such as elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and limit of elasticity. It is also instrumental in failure analysis, helping engineers and researchers understand the behavior of materials under stress and identifying potential weak points in a structure.

In conclusion, the GOM Aramis DIC system significantly advances material and structural analysis. Its ability to provide detailed, accurate measurements non-invasively makes it an invaluable tool in research and industrial applications, leading to better product design, quality control, and innovation in material science.

The GOM ARAMIS 5M system is an advanced Digital Image Correlation (DIC) tool known for its versatility and material and structural analysis precision. This unique system can perform detailed measurements without physically contacting the object. Here is a rephrased description of its key aspects.

ARAMIS systems use DIC technology for non-contact surface and point inspection, which is ideal for delicate or hazardous materials. Suitable for various object sizes, it accurately measures 3D coordinates, movement, and surface changes. It performs detailed analyses of materials’ forming limits and tensile stress responses, which are valuable in material science. Dual 12-megapixel cameras detect minute changes over large areas, providing precise data. Interchangeable camera brackets and calibrated lenses simplify setup for different measurements. The system requires fewer calibrations, ensuring consistent performance. It captures up to 25 fps at full resolution, with adjustable rates for detailed component behavior analysis. ARAMIS uses advanced techniques like normalized cross-correlation and least squares, for accurate nonlinear optimization. It recommends ideal speckle patterns for precise DIC tests and accurate deformation monitoring (see Figure 2). The system continuously monitors gray-level changes and image matching for high-accuracy analyses.

The GOM ARAMIS 5M system stands out for its non-contact, high-resolution, and adaptable measurement capabilities, making it an invaluable tool in various research and industrial applications.

The settings used in this research for the GOM Aramis were as follows. The GOM Aramis 5M DIC system was utilized. The measurement range applied was CP20 or MV90, which can measure an area of 100 × 120 mm from a distance of 836 mm with an accuracy of 0.01 mm. The sampling frequency was 0.5 Hz, approximately 0.5 fps during the measurement. The results were evaluated using GOM Aramis 2018 software.

2.2.2. List of Devices Used for Structural Testing in the Laboratory

Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 and Table 8 summarize the devices applied for structural testing in the laboratory.

2.2.3. Static Structural Tests of Sleepers

The measurements were executed according to annexes MÁVSZ 2964:2007 [54] and MÁVSZ 2964/1M [55].

The moment load-bearing requirements of reinforced concrete monoblock sleepers, according to MÁVSZ 2964:2007 [54], at the age of 28 days, are shown in Table 9 for concrete sleeper type L4.

Static tests of sleepers were carried out according to the following list (no dynamic loading test or cyclic loading test was performed):1 Examination of the cross-section under the rail in the installation position (loading the under-rail cross-section for a positive moment) in accordance with standard MSZ EN 13230-2 [56].

2 Examination of the central cross-section of the sleeper in an inverted position for a negative moment (static loading for a negative moment. Sleeper center (inverted position)) in accordance with standard Section 4.1.3 of MSZ EN 13230-2 [56].

3 Examination of the central cross-section of the sleeper in the normal position for a positive moment (static loading for a positive moment, sleeper center).

Normal and plastic fiber-reinforced sleepers were examined under vertical static loading to observe their behavior under load while recording the progress of the tests using GOM Aramis software (version 2019) and a camera system. The authors continuously monitored and recorded the development of cracks’ images (patterns) during the measurements. During the loadings, the force value was also recorded in minutes for the force ranges and the location, direction, length, and width of the cracks formed. as well as the number and time value of the resulting image in the GOM software (this for later retrieval/verifiability).

Examination of the Cross-Section under the Rail in the Installation Position

The load (force) of the under-rail cross-section for a positive moment was performed as follows (see Figure 3).

The initial (reference) forces were calculated according to the formula (Table 9 data). (1) Fro=4MdrLr−0.1 kN force under the rail for a positive moment

2.2.4. FE Modeling

Concrete Damage Plasticity Constitutive Model (CDM)

In readily available scholarly research and literature, comprehensive expositions of this model are available. At this juncture, a concise overview of the concrete constitutive model is provided, supplemented by relevant details. Utilizing the Prandtl–Reuss concept in conjunction with elasto-plastic deformations, the authors disintegrated the overall strain tensor value ϵij into two distinct components: an elastic component (ϵijel) and a plastic component (ϵijpl), as explicated in the subsequent discussion (see Equation (4)). (4) ϵij=ϵijel+ϵijpl.

The internal force–strain relations are precisely defined by the elastic damaged scalar equation (see Equation (5)). (5) σ^ij=Dijklel·(ϵij−ϵijpl)

Subsequently, the symbol Dijklel represents the diminished elastic stiffness (see Equation (6)). (6) Dijklel=1−dD0el.

In addition, D0el signifies the initial (undamaged) elastic stiffness of the material. Meanwhile, ‘d’ represents the scalar stiffness degradation variable, ranging from zero (indicating an undamaged state of the material) to one (indicating a fully damaged state of the material). In the context of scalar damage theory, the reduction in stiffness is treated as isotropic and is accounted for by the degradation variable ‘d’. By employing the established principles of continuum damage mechanics, the actual internal force is elucidated as follows (see Equation (7)):(7) σ¯ij=D0el·(ϵij−ϵijpl)

When there is no damage (i.e., d = 0), the actual internal force σ¯ij is equivalent to the internal force σ^ij. However, as the damage occurs, the actual internal force becomes a more representative measure, particularly when comparing it with the internal force regarding resistance to external loads.

Equation (5) can be reformulated by incorporating the nominal stress and the reduced elastic tensor provided in Equation (7), resulting in Equation (8). (8) σ^ij=1−dD0el·ϵij−ϵijpl.

The ensuing internal force–strain relation constitutes the foundation of the damage plasticity constitutive model (see Equation (9)). (9) σ^ij=1−d·σ¯ij→σ^ij=1−dtσ¯tij+(1−dc)σ¯Cij

The compression damage variable, denoted as dc, and the tension damage variable, denoted as dt, evolve from representing the undamaged condition (0) to signifying complete damage (1). Correspondingly, σ¯t and σ¯c represent the actual internal force in tension and compression, respectively. Typically, the model used to characterize damage in concrete accounts for two primary failure mechanisms: crushing under compression and cracking under tension.

However, understanding the uniaxial response of concrete requires a more comprehensive consideration of the intricate degradation mechanisms associated with the cyclic behavior of concrete, involving the opening and closing of micro-cracks. The plasticity-damage model is expected to influence concrete’s uniaxial compressive and tensile responses, as illustrated in Figure 9.

The uniaxial compressive and tensile responses of concrete within the context of the concrete damage plasticity model under both compression and tension loading are described as follows (see Equations (10) and (11)). (10) σt=1−dtE0(ϵt−ϵtpl,h)

(11) σc=1−dcE0(ϵc−ϵcpl,h)

expressing E0 as the initial (undamaged) Young’s modulus of the material, and denoting ϵtpl,h and ϵcpl,h as the respective plastic strains in tension and compression, the actual uniaxial compressive and tensile stresses σ¯t and σ¯c are presented as follows (see Equations (12) and (13)):(12) σ¯t=σt(1−dt)=E0(ϵt−ϵtpl,h)

(13) σ¯c=σC(1−dc)=E0(ϵc−ϵcpl,h)

Therefore, the tensile strain ϵt is defined as the sum of the plastic strain in tension ϵtpl,h and the elastic strain in tension ϵtel, while the compressive strain ϵc is defined as the sum of the plastic strain in compression ϵcpl,h and the elastic strain in compression ϵcel. Accordingly, ϵtel and ϵcel represent the respective elastic strains in tension and compression.

Numerical Modeling of the Sleeper by ABAQUS FE Software

ABAQUS software was utilized in conjunction with the Concrete Damage Plasticity (CDP) model to calibrate the concrete behavior in both the tension and compression states for numerical modeling of the sleeper specimens. Depending on the experimental results of the concrete mixes, CDP was employed to describe the concrete response in tension and compression. Two different mixes were used to cast the experimental sleeper specimens. The first mixture was regular concrete, denoted as “R” in this work, while the other mixture was prepared by adding 5056 g of plastic fibers (SIKA HPP50) and mixing them with 0.8–0.9 m³ of concrete, referred to as “S”. The experimental properties of the two mixes are presented in Table 10, including compression strength (fc), tensile strength (ft), and modulus of elasticity E.

Moreover, these characteristics were incorporated into ABAQUS to obtain the CDP parameters replicating the desired concrete damage behavior. Following sensitivity analyses, the input CDP parameters were adopted, as presented in Table 11, while the finite element analysis (FEM) assumed a concrete Poisson’s ratio of v = 0.2. The impact of the fiber reinforcement within the concrete underwent iterative calibration until the appropriate CDP parameters were established to mirror the experimental behavior.

As previously mentioned, the sleepers were reinforced with pre-stressing tendons. In this study, these tendons had a yield strength of 1650 MPa, a Modulus of Elasticity of 195,000 MPa, and a Poisson’s ratio of ν = 0.3. The applied pre-stressed load within the tendons was assumed to be 305 kN.

In contrast, the stirrups had a yield strength of 550 MPa, a modulus of elasticity of 200,000 MPa, and a Poisson’s ratio of ν = 0.3. A predefined temperature load was applied to the specified tendons to simulate the pre-stressing effect in ABAQUS.

Considering that mesh size influences both result accuracy and simulation time, a mesh size study was conducted to assess its impact on accuracy and calculation time. An optimal mesh size of 20 mm was subsequently employed to ensure accuracy. This resulted in a total element count of approximately 13,231 elements, as depicted in Figure 10.

For numerical modeling, an 8-node linear brick element with reduced integration and hourglass control (C3D8R) was utilized to define the concrete material, while two-node 3D truss elements were employed to represent the steel material. The interaction between steel bars and concrete was implemented using the embedded region option.

Furthermore, the numerical analysis involved three steps. The initial step encompassed the establishment of boundary conditions. The second step introduced the pre-stressed (predefined temperature) effect. Finally, the third step focused on analyzing and computing outputs by applying the Static Risk (SR) concentrated force. As a result, the numerical models illustrated in Figure 11 were obtained.

In this research, three distinct test methods were established. In the first method, the sleeper was subjected to a one-point load applied at its mid-span, with the load direction oriented upward. The second method applied a similar one-point load at the mid-span, but the load direction was downward this time. The third case involved loading at the base plate connected to the railway rail. Figure 12 provides a visual representation of all loading scenarios and supporting arrangements.

For the three cases (Figure 12a–c), a concentrated force was applied (static risk) at a specific point. To ensure that the applied force behaves correctly and accurately simulates the experimental conditions, a coupling effect was considered. This coupling effect involves constraining the degrees of freedom (DOFs), and the control point for the coupling aligns with the same point where the loading force is applied.

All loadings and boundary conditions were selected to comply with EN 13230-1 [57] and EN 13230-2 [56] standards, making the sleepers simply hinge supported. In the numerical simulations, the concentrated load was applied vertically to the loading surface at a single point, considering the coupling effect over a defined area. The standard values of Lr (bay length during bending tests) and Lc were adhered to, as specified in EN 13230-2 [56], with Lr = 0.6 m and Lc = 1.5 m.

Table 12 presents the experimental results for the tested specimens in each loading scenario. The specimens are denoted as follows:R and S specimens correspond to models subjected to rail base plate loading with and without fibers, respectively.

Rf and Sf are specimens subject to mid-span upward loading, with and without fibers.

Rno and Sno are specimens subjected to mid-span downward loading, with and without fibers.

Table 12 comprehensively presents the ultimate loading values obtained through rigorous experimental testing. These values represent critical insights into sleeper specimens’ structural behavior and load-bearing capacities under various loading conditions and with different concrete mixtures. Alongside this crucial data, the corresponding image is also provided, vividly displaying the areas of damage and cracks that emerged during the experiments. This visual representation serves as a valuable complement to the numerical results, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the sleeper’s response to different loading scenarios and concrete compositions. Using fibers obviously increased the ultimate load slightly, while the cracking severity clearly decreased.

3. Results and Discussion

In this section, the authors present in detail the results of the hardened concrete tests of cylindrical specimens, both normal (standard) and synthetic (plastic) fiber reinforced, carried out by sampling during the production of cross beams after 28 days of storage, and the results of the tensile and compressive strength tests of cylindrical specimens.

The extent of crack initiation and the resulting force ranges (stress ranges) were continuously monitored during structural testing. The limit states were recorded on a measurement sheet, and the behavior of the sleepers under load was observed using a GOM Aramis DIC instrument.

3.2. FE Modeling

3.2.1. Calibration Process

Upon completing the modeling process, the results and plots for calibration and comparison with experimental tests were obtained, as shown in Figure 16. The subfigures depict the load (P) versus deflection (Δ) response for all models under various loading conditions and concrete mixtures, where P represents the vertical force in kilonewtons (kN) and Δ represents the vertical deflection in millimeters (mm). The calibration was validated by the ultimate load and vertical deflection values from the experiments, with the curves in Figure 16 showing compatibility.

Table 15 details the deflection calibration outcomes, with experimental measurements taken using a specialized device capturing deflection patterns at different loads. The numerical results for both load and deflection align well with the experimental findings. Figure 16 and Table 15 illustrate a detailed comparison between DIC measurements and numerical modeling, confirming the high accuracy of the FEM predictions. For example, in the rail base plate loading scenario, FEM predicted ultimate load and deflection values within 5% of the experimental results. Table 15 further supports this finding by showing that deflection measurements for different load cases, such as mid-span upward and downward loading, were accurately captured by the numerical models. This consistent alignment confirmed that FEM effectively replicated vertical displacement and crack development observed experimentally, validating the combined use of DIC technology and numerical modeling as a robust method for evaluating the structural performance of fiber-reinforced concrete railway sleepers.

3.2.2. Results of FE Modeling

Table 15 represents the calibrated deflection values.

Various sections were examined to facilitate more comprehensive comparisons and provide clarity regarding sleeper behavior, as illustrated in Figure 17. Section A-A divides the sleeper into two-halves along its width. Section B-B crosses the sleeper section at the loading point for mid-span loading scenarios. Section C-C intersects the loading point for side-loaded cases while also crossing the support line for mid-span loading cases. Lastly, section D-D intersects the support line in the case of a side load.

Considering the sections above, the extent of damage and cracking between the numerical and experimental outcomes were compared. Table 16 summarizes the numerical results acquired following the calibration process, with fully dam-aged areas in red and undamaged ones in blue.

Conversely, Table 17 displays stress values for each steel bar in the longitudinal section (A-A) and the loading section (B-B for mid-span loading cases, C-C for side-loading cases). It is worth noting that these cases were derived at the ultimate loading level, resulting in steel bars reaching the yield point or being in a pre-yield stage due to the applied load. Additionally, it was observed that stirrups experienced minimal stresses, as they were positioned beyond the shear range for all loading scenarios.

The curves displayed in Figure 16 provide ultimate load (force) values that align with the experimental findings. Notably, a lower load value was observed when considering mid-span loading compared to the rail base plate loading case. This reduction, which exceeded half of the ultimate loading value, can be attributed to the decrease in the a/d ratio (the ratio of load to support distance), resulting in higher ultimate load values. The mid-span loading case generally exhibited higher deflection values than the other scenarios. This outcome could be attributed to applying a longer bay length, allowing the sleeper to exhibit a more elastic response, thus reflecting the recorded deflection values. It was evident that the damaged regions primarily occurred between the supports where the highest stresses were initiated. In Table 16, the damaged sections of the models are highlighted in red, signifying the most severely affected areas within the concrete. These color-coded representations specify the intensity of damage, with red indicating fully damaged parts (dt = 1) and blue hues representing undamaged sections (dt = 0).

Notably, the most extensive damage was concentrated precisely beneath the applied load, corresponding to the region where the steel bars also experienced heightened stress levels, vividly marked in red, as shown in Table 17. Conversely, the stirrups situated beyond the damage zone exhibited minimal stress, indicated by their unaltered blue color, signifying a case of minimal stress or non-yielding conditions. It is worth noting that the failure type observed is a flexural-shear failure characterized by the generation of inclined cracks or damaged sections in both the experimental and numerical findings. This leads to the conclusion that incorporating stirrups within cracked regions would prove advantageous.

Conversely, an intriguing observation emerges when comparing models with and without fibers. Adding fibers resulted in a marginal increase in the ultimate load values, aligning well with the experimental findings. Furthermore, the corresponding deflection values also exhibited a slight increment in the presence of fibers. However, the most prominent and significant impact in numerical simulations and experiments became evident in the intensity of cracking. Table 16 distinctly reveals that the inclusion of fibers leads to narrower and more confined lines of damage, thereby demonstrating the pivotal role of fibers in constraining and limiting the extent of cracks within the material.

3.3. Further Discussion

3.3.1. General Topics

The examination of mechanical properties in pre-tensioned reinforced concrete railway sleepers, both traditional and those enhanced with plastic fiber reinforcement, provides significant insights into their structural performance. Incorporating plastic fibers into sleepers leads to an assumed improvement in crack propagation control and load-bearing capacity. This is evidenced by supposed reduced crack widths and increased ultimate load capabilities in specimens reinforced with fibers, highlighting the fibers’ role in enhancing stress distribution throughout the concrete matrix. Such findings underscore the potential of fiber reinforcement to extend the durability and lifespan of railway sleepers, thereby strengthening the resilience of railway infrastructure.

These results may champion a revolutionary approach to railway sleepers’ design and material selection. Using plastic fibers not only enhances the sleepers’ mechanical properties but also signifies a shift toward greater sustainability within railway infrastructure based on the presumed results. The improvements in crack resistance and load-bearing capacities may indicate that fiber-reinforced sleepers can significantly reduce maintenance costs and increase the service life of railway tracks.

A detailed understanding of stress distribution and deformation patterns under various load conditions has been achieved by accurately calibrating and validating numerical models using ABAQUS finite element (FE) software. These models’ ability to accurately replicate sleeper behavior under a range of stress scenarios highlights the value of advanced simulation techniques in improving the sleeper design and testing process. This advancement not only optimizes the design workflow but also enables the efficient and cost-effective exploration of novel materials and reinforcement strategies.

Incorporating considerations of sustainability into the development of reinforced railway sleepers is an important area of future research. Utilizing plastic fibers, particularly from recycled materials, can significantly contribute to a circular economy and lessen the environmental impact of railway construction. Additionally, lifecycle assessments of fiber-reinforced sleepers can offer valuable insights into their environmental and economic benefits, further promoting sustainable infrastructure development practices.

This research signifies a pivotal progression in civil engineering materials science, offering compelling evidence of the advantages of plastic fiber reinforcement in railway sleepers. It contributes to the evolution of more robust, efficient, and sustainable railway systems globally, overcoming traditional barriers in sleeper design and material application. The ongoing pursuit of innovative materials and design techniques is expected to be crucial in the continual evolution of railway infrastructure.

3.3.2. Specific Topics

Based on the results mentioned above, written in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, the following observations can be drawn regarding the laboratory tests and calibrated-validated modeling carried out: There were cases where fibers were twisted/turned into cracks during/before load removal, but the cracks did not close after load removal;

The real deflection (vertical displacement) values were compared with the results obtained from numerical modeling;

In the DIC measurements, the surface area was 100 × 100 mm (or 150 × 150 mm), which showed only a small area of failure. This proved to be a good solution for the cross-section below the rail; however, in the case of loading the middle cross-section up to failure, the cracks appearing in the load “lower pulled-bended area” could not be examined.

The examination of crack development in pre-stressed concrete railway sleepers reinforced with plastic fibers revealed detailed insights. During load application, cracks first appeared at force values of 45 kN, monitored continuously using DIC technology. The inclusion of plastic fibers significantly reduced crack width and promoted a more confined crack pattern compared to traditional sleepers. For instance, at a force value of 95.2 kN, the plastic fiber-reinforced specimens exhibited less severe cracks, demonstrating their enhanced crack resistance and limited crack propagation. Additionally, the crack width at 0.05 mm remained after unloading at a force of 275 kN for fiber-reinforced sleepers, compared to 320 kN for non-reinforced ones, indicating an improvement in crack control. This crack management significantly contributes to the overall structural integrity and longevity of railway sleepers, highlighting the effectiveness of plastic fiber reinforcement in reducing maintenance needs and extending service life.

In the case of bending tests of the sleepers with the examination of the cross-section under the rail in the installation position (rail base plate loading case), see Section 3.1.1. The regular (reference) sleepers provided 436.39 kN, while the synthetic-reinforced ones provided 433.83 kN load-bearing capacity considering the average static vertical force values according to the test setup. Comparing the synthetic-reinforced specimens with the regular (reference) ones, there was a –0.6% difference. This means that the plastic reinforcing fibers slightly reduced the reference load-bearing capacity. Interestingly, there was a −6.3% reduction in the Frr values on average (175.0 kN for R specimens and 164.0 kN for S specimens, respectively), while comparing Fr0.10 and Fr0.05 values, these differences were +11.6% and −14.1%, respectively. There were no differences between the other results (values) according to the measurements.

In the case of bending tests of the sleepers with the examination of the central cross-section of the sleeper in an inverted position for a negative moment (mid-span upward loading case), see Section 3.1.2. The regular (reference) sleeper provided 95.2 kN, while the synthetic-reinforced one 97.7 kN load-bearing capacity, considering the average static vertical force values according to the test setup. It was a +2.6% improvement with the synthetic reinforcement. Comparing the Fc0.05n values, there was a –14.3% reduction (70.0 kN for the R specimen and 60.0 kN for the S specimen, respectively). There were no differences between the other results (values) according to the measurements.

In the case of bending tests of the sleepers with the examination of the central cross-section of the sleeper in the normal position for a positive moment (mid-span downward loading case), see Section 3.1.3. The regular (reference) sleeper provided 106.0 kN, while the synthetic-reinforced one had a 111.6 kN load-bearing capacity, considering the average static vertical force values according to the test setup. It was a +5.3% improvement with the synthetic reinforcement. Comparing the Fc0.05 values, there was a +33.3% increase (60.0 kN for the R specimen and 80.0 kN for the S specimen, respectively). In the case of Fcr, the improvement was +9.1% (55.0 kN for the R specimen and 60.0 kN for the S specimen). There were no differences between the other results (values) according to the measurements.

The authors were able to calibrate the FE models (see Section 3.2.1) with a maximum of ±2–5% differences compared to the real experiments conducted in the laboratory (see Section 3.1). The primary calibration process was based on the vertical deflection values measured using the GOM Aramis DIC system.

Based on the vertical deflection results (see Section 3.2.1), there was a clear result that the specimens reinforced by plastic fibers provided an improvement compared to the regular (reference) types (i.e., without additional plastic fiber reinforcement). Parallel with these results, in the case of bending tests of the sleepers with the examination of the central cross-section of the sleeper in an inverted position for a negative moment (mid-span upward loading case) until 50–55 kN, there was no significant difference, while between this value and approximately 92 kN, the S specimen was worse than the R specimen (the maximal vertical deflection difference was approximately 50%, 6.0 mm compared to 4.0 mm). At approximately 92 kN, there was an “inflection point”, and above 92.0 kN, a slight improvement was observed. In the case of bending tests of the sleepers with the examination of the central cross-section of the sleeper in a normal position for a positive moment (mid-span downward loading case), the inflection point was at approximately 80 kN, i.e., below this value, the S specimen provided lower vertical deflections than the R specimens; hence, above it, the result was the opposite. Below 80 kN, the difference was not significant; however, between 80 kN and the ultimate load, the difference was enormous.

Section 3.2.2 contains the details related to the FE analysis, and every small detail can be checked synchronously with the DIC measurements.

Based on the above results, and without long-term field tests, the examined plastic fiber-reinforced sleepers cannot be unequivocally recommended; however, they sometimes improve the load-bearing capacity values and the vertical deflections. More detailed investigations are needed in the future.

4. Conclusions

The current study represents a significant advancement in understanding and using additional plastic fiber reinforcement in manufacturing pre-tensioned reinforced concrete railway sleepers, showing notable progress in railway infrastructure technology.

Through detailed experimental and numerical analysis, including sophisticated finite element modeling in ABAQUS and comparisons with lab results, this study highlights the structural advantages and resilience that plastic fibers add to concrete sleepers, while also pointing out the complexity and varying impacts of this type of reinforcement.

The research delves into how these fibers behave under and after stress, uncovering instances where fibers bend or twist into cracks but fail to return to their original shape once the stress is removed. This reveals a complex relationship between the fibers’ assumed orientation and the concrete’s integrity when under pressure.

The study closely compares actual deflection measurements to those predicted by numerical models using the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method for accurate vertical displacement measurements. This approach, which focuses on specific surface areas, was effective in identifying failure modes, particularly in crucial sections beneath rail bases, although it did reveal some limitations in tracking crack development under certain stress conditions.

In terms of quantitative analysis, the research provides an in-depth look at how reinforced sleepers perform under various loads. For example, in bending tests at the rail cross-section, sleepers reinforced with synthetic fibers showed a slight reduction in load-bearing capacity of 0.6% compared to standard sleepers, suggesting a minor decrease in load-bearing ability. However, this was accompanied by exciting findings in reducing and improving specific force resistance values, indicating that while the overall capacity slightly diminished, the performance under certain stresses could actually improve.

The study also examined different loading scenarios according to related standards, like mid-span upward and downward loading cases, and found improvements in load-bearing capacity with synthetic reinforcement by 2.6% and 5.3%, respectively. These scenarios also showcased variances in vertical deflection performance, with reinforced sleepers displaying both enhancements and decreases in deflection resistance at various stages of loading, highlighting the intricate performance traits of these materials under different structural stresses.

The accuracy of the Finite Element (FE) models, calibrated to within a 2–5% difference from actual lab experiments, showcases the precision of the simulation techniques used. This calibration, primarily based on vertical deflection measurements taken by the GOM Aramis DIC system, provides a valuable tool for predicting sleeper performance under a range of conditions. However, it also emphasizes the need for more detailed studies and long-term field tests before recommending the widespread use of plastic fiber-reinforced sleepers.

This thorough study significantly contributes to the field of civil engineering materials science and opens the door to more sustainable and resilient railway infrastructure solutions. By incorporating innovative materials like plastic fibers into the design of railway sleepers, the research underlines a dedication to improving durability and efficiency, establishing a new benchmark for railway construction and maintenance. Although the findings are encouraging, they underscore the essential role of material science and engineering in meeting modern challenges and driving forward technological advances in the railway industry.

The authors conclude that, based on the presented results and without long-term field tests, the examined plastic fiber-reinforced sleepers cannot be unequivocally recommended. However, they sometimes improve load-bearing capacity values and vertical deflections. More detailed investigations are needed in the future.
