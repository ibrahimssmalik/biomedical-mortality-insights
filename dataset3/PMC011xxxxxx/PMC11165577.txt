N-Heterocyclic carbene pentafluorophosphorus (NHC-PF5) adducts are six-coordinate phosphorus(v) compounds with emerging applications but poor synthetic accessibility. We have developed a simple and high yielding protocol for synthesizing imidazolylidene NHC-PF5 adducts from silylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate salts. Using this methodology, we have prepared a series of NHC-PF5 adducts in high yields, including new NHC-PF5 building blocks amenable to subsequent synthetic diversification. We also demonstrate that a similar approach enables access to analogous, synthetically elusive NHC-BF3 and NHC-SbF5 adducts.

==== Body
pmcN-Heterocyclic carbene-pentafluorophosphorus (NHC-PF5) adducts are neutral, six-coordinate phosphorus(v) compounds possessing high thermal and hydrolytic stability1−4 owing to the strong σ-donating properties of NHCs5,6 and the high fluoride ion affinity of P(v) centers.7,8 Although the scope of NHC-PF5 adducts reported to date is presently restricted to imidazolyl-PF5 species, these fluorine-rich compounds have garnered interest for applications in nuclear medicine2 and battery materials,9 and as potential liquid crystal mesogens.10 However, broader applications of NHC-PF5-containing molecules and materials remain limited by a dearth of suitable methodologies to access the NHC-PF5 functionality. Arduengo and co-workers were the first to report the synthesis of an NHC-PF5 adduct,11 which was prepared by treating a pregenerated imidazolylidene NHC with PF5 (Scheme 1a). Saturated imidazolylidene analogues can be constructed by reacting difluoroimidazolidines with PF3 (Scheme 1b),1,10,12 but the toxicity of PF3 poses practical limitations to this methodology. Using simple imidazolium hexafluorophosphate salts, Borzov and co-workers found that high vacuum pyrolysis at 300–400 °C produced NHC-PF5 adducts in high yields (Scheme 1c).3,13 However, hydrogen fluoride (HF) is the stoichiometric byproduct of this reaction, which putatively proceeds via thermal decomposition of PF6– to F– and PF5, followed by F–-mediated deprotonation of the imidazolium. As the only available methodologies in the literature to date, these examples reveal a need for safer and more general synthetic technologies to expand access to NHC-PF5 compounds.

Scheme 1 (a–c) Existing Synthetic Preparations of NHC-PF5 Adducts and (d) the Methodology Described in This Work

Here, we describe an operationally simple and high-yielding method for the preparation of NHC-PF5 adducts from 5-silylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate salts 1 (Scheme 1d). An advantage of the method reported by Borzov is that it obviates the need to handle PF5 (or PF3) by generating PF5 in situ from PF6–, although a critical limitation of this system is the extreme temperatures presumably required for PF6– decomposition. Trends in the thermal decomposition of alkali metal PF6– salts (e.g., Tdecomp. (LiPF6) = 97 °C; Tdecomp. (NaPF6) = 128 °C; Tdecomp. (KPF6) = 460 °C)14 suggested to us that Lewis acidic cations could facilitate defluorination of PF6– at lower temperatures. Inspired by prior work in which PF6– decomposition was observed in the presence of electrophilic silanes (Figure 1a),15−19 we envisaged that the Si-centers of silylimidazolium cations 3 may be sufficiently Lewis acidic to elicit defluorinative decomposition of PF6– to PF5 (Figure 1b). Desilylation of a 2-silylimidazolium would deliver the requisite NHC 4 and PF5, similar to the mechanism proposed by Borzov, but with a comparatively inert fluorosilane as the byproduct, rather than HF. 2-Silylimidazolium salts 3 are indeed known to be highly electrophilic;20 however, 2-silylimidazolium salts and their synthetic precursors—2-silylimidazoles—are hydrolytically unstable,21−23 which would restrict the utility of 2-silylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate salts 3 as substrates for NHC-PF5 adduct synthesis. On the other hand, we considered 5-silylimidazolium salts 1 as alternative precursors, reasoning that the imidazol-5-ylidene 5 (an “abnormal NHC”24,25) initially generated upon desilylation could equilibrate to the more stable “normal NHC”26,27 in the presence of a catalytic weak Brønsted acid like 1 (Figure 1b) or 7 (see Figure 2). 5-Silylimidazolium salts 1 can be readily synthesized by alkylation or arylation of 5-silylimidazoles,22,23,28 or by lithiation-silylation of imidazol-2-ylidenes29−33 (Figure 1c).

Figure 2 Initial results demonstrating the successful formation of NHC-adduct 2a and mechanistic rationale to account for byproducts 6a and 7a.

We began our investigation by probing the thermal reactivity of 5-silylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate salt 1a under solvent-free conditions (Figure 2). Upon heating at 190 °C, silylimidazolium 1a underwent complete conversion and generated the desired NHC-PF5 adduct in a moderate yield (51%), along with another NHC-PF5 adduct, 6a, and imidazolium hexafluorophosphate salt 7a as byproducts in 17% and 25% yield, respectively. The identities of 2a and 6a were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure S12 and S13). Byproducts 6a and 7a are consistent with a mechanism involving bimolecular proton transfer between imidazol-5-ylidene 5a and silylimidazolium 1a, with silyl-NHC 4a’ and imidazolium 7a as the resultant intermediates (Figure 2). Subsequent addition of silyl-NHC 4a’ to PF5 would produce the observed silyl-NHC-PF5 adduct 6a. Adduct 6a is more likely to form in the early stages of reaction, when silylimidazolium 1a is more abundant than imidazolium 7a. Ultimately, deprotonation of imidazolium 7a, either by imidazol-5-ylidene 5a or by imidazol-2-ylidene 4a’, would generate the NHC 4a that goes on to form the major product, NHC-PF5 adduct 2a.

Building on these initial results, we used imidazolium hexafluorophosphate 1b as a model substrate in our efforts to optimize the reaction, which primarily sought to minimize byproducts 6b and 7b (Table 1, Tables S1–S4). Heating 1b to 200 °C with no solvent or additives produced the desired NHC-PF5 product 2b, but in lower yield (17% yield) and lower conversion (58% conversion) than in the reaction of 1a (Table 1, entry 1). When screening additives to improve conversion, we found that catalytic quantities of LiPF6 (0.1 equiv) led to a drastic improvement in the yield of 2b at 71%, with only trace amounts of byproduct 6b observed (Table 1, entry 2; Table S1). Use of other hexafluorophosphate salts as additives showed inferior performance (Table 1, entries 3–4; Table S2, entries 6–8), suggesting that the Li+ cation was uniquely responsible for the beneficial effect observed with LiPF6. LiCl also furnished improved yields of 2b (73% yield), while other lithium salts (e.g., LiBr and LiOTf) were problematic (Table S2, entries 2–5).

b % yield was determined from 1H NMR spectra of the crude reaction mixture relative to dimethylsulfone as an internal standard.

c % conversion was 58% for entry 1. For all other entries in this table, % conversion was 100%.

Considering the possibility that Li+ acts as a Lewis acid to promote PF6– decomposition, we screened various Lewis acids, which gave high conversion of starting material in all cases (Table 1, entries 4–6; Table S2, entries 8–13). ZnCl2 and AlCl3 showed the highest yields of the desired product 2b in this series at 60% and 73% yield, respectively, which are comparable to LiPF6. We did not obtain synthetically useful yields at reaction temperatures lower than 180 °C, and LiPF6 was necessary for productive reactivity under these conditions (e.g., Table S3, entry 17 vs entry 18). Use of high-boiling solvents generally led to improved yields (Table S3), with diphenyl ether (Ph2O) delivering the best results (Table 1, entry 7). There is marginal benefit to using LiPF6 in Ph2O at 200 °C (Table 1, entry 7 vs entry 8), and no benefit to using LiPF6 in Ph2O at 220 °C (Table 1, entry 11 vs entry 12), which is consistent with high background PF6– decomposition at these elevated temperatures (see Supporting Information for additional discussion on the effect of Li+ and other Lewis acids).

We briefly surveyed the influence of the site and identity of the silyl group by reacting silylimidazolium salts 1b-b′′′ under the optimized reaction conditions (Figure 3). In stark contrast to silylimidazolium 1b, its regioisomer 1b′ yielded no observable product 2b at full conversion. It is possible that the imidazol-4-ylidene produced upon desilylation decomposes via a Sommelet-Hauser-type [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (Figure S10),34 although we have not been able to identify any products that would support this conjecture. Under the same conditions, trimethylsilylimidazolium 1b′′ and triisopropylsilylimidazolium 1b′′′ both provided lower but serviceable yields of 2b. Incomplete conversion in the reaction of 1b′′′ implies somewhat attenuated reactivity for this sterically hindered silane. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that 5-silylimidazolium salts with different steric environments at the silicon center still support productive reactivity.

Figure 3 Evaluation of regioisomer and silane substituent effects in the reactions of 1b–1b′′′

Having identified conditions that produce NHC-PF5 adduct 2b in high yields, we further evaluated the substrate scope of this transformation with silylimidazolium salts 1a–m (Figure 4). A majority of these substrates were prepared from 5-(triphenylsilyl)imidazole S1, which afforded easily tractable, crystalline silylimidazolium salts 1a–j upon alkylation or arylation. Excellent isolated yields were obtained for NHC-PF5 adducts with N,N-dialkyl substitution (2a,c,d) and for benzyl substituted NHC-PF5 products 2b and 2e. Benzyl NHC-PF5 product 2b was isolated in high yield when the reaction was conducted on a 1 mmol scale (63%). Reasonable isolated yields obtained for N-phenyl NHC-PF5 product 2f (48% yield) shows that N-arylsilylimidazolium salts are also suitable substrates. Chloroethyl imidazolium 1h gave lower isolated yields (17%) of NHC-PF5 adduct 2h due to competing elimination of the alkyl chloride to an N-vinyl NHC-PF5 adduct (Figure S2). Substrates with moderately acidic C–H bonds (e.g., propargylimidazolium 1i) and Lewis basic sites (e.g., nitrile 1j) have thus far proven recalcitrant, and generally produced significant amounts of intractable material.

Reaction conditions: a(i) 220 °C. b(ii) 200 °C. c(iii) 0.1 equiv of LiPF6, 200 °C. d(iv) 0.1 equiv of LiPF6, 180 °C. e% yield in parentheses at a 1.0 mmol scale. fFor 1k–1m, a trimethylsilyl imidazolium salt was used instead of a triphenylsilyl imidazolium.

Informed by previous reports where 5-silyl-NHCs were generated by lithiation-silylation of imidazol-2-ylidenes,29−31 we prepared 5-silylimidazolium salts 1k–1m directly from symmetrical imidazolium salts (see Supporting Information, Section 2d) and screened these sterically bulky substrates for reactivity. Dimesitylsilylimidazolium salt 1k and diisopropylimidazolium salt 1l afforded moderate yields of the corresponding NHC-PF5 adducts 2k and 2l (41% and 35%, respectively), establishing a two-step route to NHC-PF5 adducts from commercially available imidazolium salts. Unlike 1l, di-tert-butylimidazolium salt 1m did not produce the expected NHC-PF5 adduct 2m, and instead formed N-PF5 adduct 2m′ (see Supporting Information, Section 3g).

Prior NHC-PF5 syntheses have largely failed to produce NHC-PF5 compounds with functional handles amenable to subsequent modification. Among the products accessible by our methodology, NHC-PF5 adducts 2e and 2g stand out as versatile synthetic intermediates (Figure 5). Using standard Suzuki-Miyaura-type cross-coupling conditions, adduct 2e was smoothly transformed to biaryl 8 (90% yield). Biaryl 8 and similar NHC-PF5-containing structures are candidates of interest for new mesogenic materials, which we are currently investigating in our lab. The NHC-PF5 moiety is also stable to free radical conditions, which enabled successful preparation of the novel non-natural amino acid derivative 9 in 82% yield from allyl NHC-PF5 adduct 2g through a thiol–ene reaction. These examples demonstrate that the NHC-PF5 functionality is inert to additional synthetic manipulations, and they illustrate how our methodology serves as an entryway to more complex NHC-PF5-bearing molecules.

Finally, we extended this synthetic approach to prepare NHC adducts of other fluorinated main group element centers (Figure 6). Under similar conditions used for the synthesis of NHC-PF5 adducts, NHC-BF3 adduct 11 was isolated in 72% yield from tetrafluoroborate salt 10, offering a route to NHC-BF3 adducts that is complementary to existing methods.3,11,35 NHC-SbF5 adducts are comparatively elusive, with a singular literature precedent that was synthesized by reacting a stable NHC with SbF5.11 We successfully synthesized NHC-SbF5 adduct 13 in 37% yield simply by heating silylimidazolium hexafluoroantimonate salt 12 at 180 °C, which enabled isolation and structural characterization of NHC-SbF5 adduct 13 by XRD (Figure S14). This unoptimized result nevertheless circumvents the use of SbF5 as in the prior report11 and permits expansion of this rare class of molecules beyond NHC-SbF5 adducts derived from isolable NHCs.

Figure 6 Preparation of NHC-BF3 and NHC-SbF5 adducts from the corresponding silylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate salt 10 and hexafluoroantimonate salt 12.

In summary, we have developed a simple method for generating imidazolyl NHC-PF5 adducts in good to moderate yields from 5-silylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate salts. This transformation likely proceeds via in situ formation of PF5 from PF6– with a benign fluorosilane as the primary byproduct. As such, this protocol obviates the use of unstable and toxic reagents (e.g., PF5 and PF3) or byproducts (e.g., HF) that have rendered existing methodologies impractical. Our methodology affords key synthetic lynchpins for divergent functionalization, which we anticipate will enable broader deployment of the NHC-PF5 functionality across synthetic disciplines. Furthermore, as evidenced by the isolation of NHC-BF3 and NHC-SbF5 adducts through a similar methodology, this work establishes the utility of silylimidazolium salts in accessing novel NHC-main group element adducts.
