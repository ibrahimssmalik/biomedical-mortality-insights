We present a genome assembly from an individual female Mesoligia furuncula (the Cloaked Minor; Arthropoda; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Noctuidae). The genome sequence is 889.6 megabases in span. Most of the assembly is scaffolded into 31 chromosomal pseudomolecules, including the Z sex chromosome. The mitochondrial genome has also been assembled and is 15.3 kilobases in length. Gene annotation of this assembly on Ensembl identified 21,903 protein coding genes.

Background

The Cloaked Minor Mesoligia furuncula is a small moth in the family Noctuidae (wingspan 22–28 mm) found widely across central and northern Europe, with scattered records from Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China and Japan ( GBIF Secretariat, 2022). The moth is common across southern England, northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands, where it is found in grassland, scrub, open woodland and suburban areas ( De Prins & Steeman, 2022; Randle et al., 2019). In Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and Ireland the species is more coastal in its distribution, being primarily associated with dunes and coastal grassland ( GBIF Secretariat, 2022).

The forewing colouration is variable, but a consistent feature is a division of the ground colour into two near equal regions: a darker basal region (the ‘cloak’) and a paler cream, buff or brown distal region. Colour variants were originally considered different species before conspecificity was recognized ( Newman, 1869). The adult moth is on the wing in July and August, with the larvae feeding on grasses including sheep’s-fescue Festuca ovina, tufted hair-grass Deschampsia cespitosa and false oat-grass Arrhenatherum elatius ( De Prins & Steeman, 2022; Waring et al., 2017). There is a single generation per year in northern Europe; the larva overwinters before recommencing feeding in spring and pupating in a chamber at the base of the food plant.

The genome of M. furuncula was sequenced as part of the Darwin Tree of Life project. The assembled sequence will be useful in understanding adaptations to grass feeding and the genetic basis of colour polymorphism, and contribute to comparative genomic studies across Lepidoptera.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one female Mesoligia furuncula ( Figure 1) collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (latitude 51.77, longitude –1.33). A total of 24-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads and 62-fold coverage in 10X Genomics read clouds were generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 284 missing joins or mis-joins and removed 27 haplotypic duplications, reducing the assembly length by 1.44% and the scaffold number by 67.25%, and increasing the scaffold N50 by 62.83%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Mesoligia furuncula (ilMesFuru1) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 889.6 Mb in 93 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 30.3 Mb ( Table 1). Most (99.64%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 31 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 30 autosomes and the Z sex chromosome. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 2– Figure 5; Table 2). The sex was designated as female due to half coverage of the Z chromosome. Linkage has been observed in the Hi-C map between chromosomes 8 and 25. This linkage is specific, such that an alternative karyotype could be constructed {8A:8B,25A:25B} and {8B:25A,8A,25B}. No support for this fusion between chromosome 8 and 25 can be seen in the PacBio reads which derive from a different sample to the Hi-C.

Genome annotation report

The M. furuncula genome assembly GCA_916614155.1 was annotated using the Ensembl rapid annotation pipeline ( Table 1; https://rapid.ensembl.org/Mesoligia_furuncula_GCA_916614155.1/Info/Index). The resulting annotation includes 22,079 transcribed mRNAs from 21,903 protein-coding genes.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

Two adult M. furuncula were collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire (biological vice-county: Berkshire), UK (latitude 51.77, longitude –1.33) by Douglas Boyes (University of Oxford) on 25 June 2020. Individual ilMesFuru1 (specimen Ox000519) was used for acquisition of the genome sequence; individual ilMesFuru3 (specimen Ox000520) was used for RNA sequencing. An adult M. furuncula was collected from Hever Castle, Kent, UK (latitude 51.88, longitude 0.12) by Gavin Broad (Natural History Museum, London) on 7 August 2020; this individual (ilMesFuru2, specimen NHMUK010635087) was used for scaffolding using Hi-C.

DNA was extracted at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The ilMesFuru1 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice. Whole organism tissue was disrupted using a Nippi Powermasher fitted with a BioMasher pestle. High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted using the Qiagen MagAttract HMW DNA extraction kit. Low molecular weight DNA was removed from a 20 ng aliquot of extracted DNA using the 0.8X AMpure XP purification kit prior to 10X Chromium sequencing; a minimum of 50 ng DNA was submitted for 10X sequencing. HMW DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30. Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation using AMPure PB beads with a 1.8X ratio of beads to sample to remove the shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA sample. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

RNA was extracted from whole organism tissue of ilMesFuru3 in the Tree of Life Laboratory at the WSI using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was then eluted in 50 μl RNAse-free water and its concentration assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit RNA Broad-Range (BR) Assay kit. Analysis of the integrity of the RNA was done using Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit and Eukaryotic Total RNA assay.

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus and 10X Genomics read cloud DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Poly(A) RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the NEB Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit. DNA and RNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi), Illumina HiSeq 4000 (RNA-Seq) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (10X) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from head tissue of ilMesFuru2, using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). One round of polishing was performed by aligning 10X Genomics read data to the assembly with Long Ranger ALIGN, calling variants with FreeBayes ( Garrison & Marth, 2012). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using SALSA2 ( Ghurye et al., 2019). The assembly was checked for contamination as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2022), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence. To evaluate the assembly, MerquryFK was used to estimate consensus quality (QV) scores and k-mer completeness ( Rhie et al., 2020). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

The paper clearly describes the quality and completeness of the genome, which is also of very high quality. I have two suggestions for improvement:

1. Within the abstract, I suggest to replace 'Most of the assembly is scaffolded..." directly by the exact percentage i.e. "99.64% of the assembly is scaffolded..."

2. Within the part "Genome sequence report", there is one paragraph that is less clear and concerns the linkage between chromosomes 8 and 25. First, it is unclear what is meant with "This linkage is specific..." and it would be helpful to elaborate a bit more what is exactly meant with "specific". Second, the HiC contact map (Fig. 5) does not show this linkage. Third, the authors describe that PacBio reads do not support this linkage and attribute this to the fact that another individual was used. However, I wonder how reasonable it is that the PacBio assembly would reveal this linkage? In sum, some more explanation about this linkage and what it potentially entails would be welcome.

3. I suggest to add the chromosome numbers in Fig. 5 (also helpful to interpret the previous point).

I appreciate the authors for putting together the entire genome sequence of Mesoligia furuncula (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775). The authors sequenced about 889 mega bases in the genome assembly using 93 scaffolds. The sequence has been correctly submitted by the authors to the public database. The phylogenomic researchers will find value in this robust data.  

The first sentence of the abstract can be changed as “The genome of an individual female Mesoligia furuncula (Insect: Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was sequenced and assembled”

There is a spelling error in the species name in the “species taxonomy”. furunculi was typed instead of furuncula. Correct the spelling of the species name.

Under the subheading “Genome sequence report” first paragraph seventh line” with chromosome conformation” It can be changed as “with chromosome confirmation”

The manuscript is well prepared, and it can be accepted for indexing.
