Nonreciprocal quantum transport effect is mainly governed by the symmetry breaking of the material systems and is gaining extensive attention in condensed matter physics. Realizing electrical switching of the polarity of the nonreciprocal transport without external magnetic field is essential to the development of nonreciprocal quantum devices. However, electrical switching of superconducting nonreciprocity remains yet to be achieved. Here, we report the observation of field-free electrical switching of nonreciprocal Ising superconductivity in Fe3GeTe2/NbSe2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. By taking advantage of this electrically switchable superconducting nonreciprocity, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept nonreciprocal quantum neuronal transistor, which allows for implementing the XOR logic gate and faithfully emulating biological functionality of a cortical neuron in the brain. Our work provides a promising pathway to realize field-free and electrically switchable nonreciprocity of quantum transport and demonstrate its potential in exploring neuromorphic quantum devices with both functionality and performance beyond the traditional devices.

The authors demonstrate magnetic-field-free electric switching of superconducting nonreciprocity in Fe3GeTe2/NbSe2 heterostructures. They apply this to propose and demonstrate a proof-of-concept “neural transistor”, a tetrode device that realizes an XOR gate with only a single transistor.

pmcIntroduction

Nonreciprocity is an inherent property of materials describing the inequality of the electric or optical signals traveling in opposite directions. This nonreciprocity is usually strongly correlated to the intricate interplay among various types of symmetry breaking, such as inversion symmetry, time-reversal symmetry and mirror symmetry1–7. Manipulation of the nonreciprocity by switching the polarized states resulting from the spontaneous symmetry breaking could give unique opportunities for developing future technologies. Particular interest in this field lies in the nonreciprocal superconducting transport8–18, which could be exploited to develop next-generation electronic devices that have ultralow dissipation and new functionalities, such as electronic synapses and neurons19–25. A key step for that purpose is achieving electrical switching of the nonreciprocal superconductivity without the assistance of the external magnetic field, but the electrically switchable nonreciprocal superconductivity is still absent. It’s worth noting that the polarity of such a superconducting diode effect is usually strongly entwined with the breaking mechanisms of time-reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry26. To that end, searching unconventional superconductors with magnetization- or ferroelectricity- determined nonreciprocity would give a unique opportunity for electrically switching the superconducting diode behavior by reversing those polarized symmetry-broken states13,27.

In this work, we demonstrate the electrically switchable nonreciprocal Ising superconductivity at zero magnetic field in a perpendicular-anisotropy Ising-superconducting (PAIS) quantum material. The PAIS material is synthesized by stacking a layered Ising superconductor, which has Ising-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC)28, onto a vdW magnet of perpendicular anisotropy29. With the high-quality vdW interface, strong magnetic proximity is induced in the Ising superconductor and breaks time-reversal symmetry, leading to the emergence of field-free nonreciprocal Ising-superconductivity, i.e., superconducting diode effect. Moreover, the polarity of nonreciprocal superconductivity in the PAIS device can be switched by electrically reversing the magnetization at zero magnetic field through current-induced out-of-plane spin accumulation. Based on the electrical manipulation of this magnetization-determined superconducting diode effect, the proposed nonreciprocal neuronal transistor can implement an XOR logic gate and faithfully emulate the biological functionality of a cortical neuron in the brain. Our work demonstrates that the electrical switching of nonreciprocal quantum transport in condensed matter systems shows great potential in neuromorphic computing.

Results

Field-free and magnetization-determined superconducting diode

The PAIS device was fabricated by stacking vdW magnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and Ising superconductor 2H-NbSe2 (Fig. 1a, b). We carried out measurements of the longitudinal resistance under different temperatures. A typical PAIS device with five-layer NbSe2 (see the atomic force microscope images and corresponding height profiles in Supplementary Fig. 1) exhibits a superconducting behavior with a transition temperature of Tc ≈ 2.95 K (Fig. 1c). To characterize the magnetization of the PAIS material, we measured the Hall resistance under various magnetic field (Supplementary Fig. 2). The results show hysteresis loops of Hall resistance which shrink as temperature increases, indicating that the PAIS device possesses switchable perpendicular magnetization states, denoted as magnetization “UP” and “DOWN” states.Fig. 1 Measurement configuration and magnetization-determined nonreciprocal Ising superconductivity.

The scale bar is 3 μm. c Temperature dependence of the device resistance with an applied electrical current of 0.5 μA. d Current dependences of the resistance under various magnetic fields for both positive and negative currents at 1.6 K when the magnetization is set as “UP” state. e The nonreciprocal component of the critical current ΔIc as a function of the magnetic field for the magnetization “UP” state. f Current dependences of the resistance under various magnetic fields for both positive and negative currents at 1.6 K when the magnetization is set as “DOWN” state. g The nonreciprocal component of the critical current ΔIc as a function of the magnetic field for the magnetization “DOWN” state.

We then investigated the superconducting behaviors under different magnetization states. We first set the magnetization state of the device as “UP” and swept the d.c. current under different perpendicular magnetic fields Bz, and monitored the longitudinal resistance at the temperature of 1.6 K. As shown in Fig. 1d, sharp jumps of resistance occur as the current reaches a critical value (∣Ic∣). When Bz is applied in the positive direction of the z-axis (e.g., Bz=+10mT), ∣Ic∣ strongly depends on the direction of the current flowing (positive +I or negative −I), indicating the nonreciprocity of the supercurrent, i.e., superconducting diode effect. Such nonreciprocal supercurrent, characterized by ΔIc=∣Ic+∣−∣Ic−∣, is dependent on the applied magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 1e. Here, ΔIc>0 and ΔIc<0 corresponds to the “+” and “−” polarity, respectively. Notably, as Bz is set to zero, a significant nonreciprocal supercurrent with “+” polarity still exists, suggesting the emergence of a superconducting diode effect does not require external field. This nonreciprocity with “+” polarity is retained until Bz=−10mT and eventually reversed to that with “−” polarity (i.e., ΔIc<0). When the magnetic field further increases, the nonreciprocal supercurrent ΔIc is then suppressed beyond a certain magnetic field due to field-induced breakdown of superconductivity (Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast, we observed the nonreciprocal supercurrent with the same magnitude but opposite polarity, when the magnetization is switched to the “DOWN” state (Fig. 1f, g). Such nonreciprocity of superconducting transport can persist to zero external magnetic field in our PAIS device. This is in stark contrast to that reported in nonmagnetic superconducting device8, in which the nonreciprocal superconducting transport only emerges at non-zero external magnetic field. Such zero-field superconducting diode effect can produce a large nonreciprocal efficiency, defined by η=2(∣Ic+∣−Ic−)∣Ic+∣+∣Ic−∣, up to 13% at 1.6 K, which is much larger than the value (6% at 0.9 K) previously reported in NbSe2-based heterostructure16. Since the direction of electrical transport is perpendicular to the magnetization, the observed nonreciprocal superconductivity is similar to magneto-toroidal nonreciprocal directional dichroism (NDD) effect5. Note that the nonreciprocal superconducting behavior is determined by the magnetization state in our PAIS device. Electrical switching of the magnetization is thus critical for developing ultralow-power electronic devices based on the superconducting diode effect.

Field-free electrical switching of superconducting diode

We demonstrated that such electrical switching of the polarity of nonreciprocal superconductivity in the PAIS device can be realized through d.c. current pulse. We first swept the pulsed d.c. current Ipulse applied to the PAIS device at 1.6 K and monitored the change in the Hall resistance, with the corresponding results presented in Fig. 2a. At zero magnetic field, sweeping Ipulse upwards or downwards to a critical value can change the sign of the Hall resistance. This phenomenon is consistent with the anomalous Hall effect observed in the same device (Fig. 2b), confirming that the d.c. current pulse can switch the magnetization state in the PAIS device. To be specific, a positive current pulse favors the reversal of the magnetization to “UP” state, while a negative current pulse switches the magnetization to “DOWN” state. Such field-free electrical switching of magnetization could enable the electrical manipulation of nonreciprocal superconducting transport due to the intrinsic intertwinement of magnetization and nonreciprocal superconductivity. As shown in Fig. 2c, after applying a positive current pulse (Ipulse =+10 mA), we observed the field-free nonreciprocal superconductivity with “+” polarity, consistent with the behavior of magnetization “UP” state demonstrated in Fig. 1d. By contrast, a negative current pulse (Ipulse =−10 mA) can switch the nonreciprocal superconductivity with “+” polarity to its opposite, which is consistent with the behavior of magnetization “DOWN” state shown in Fig. 1f. Such electrical switching of the nonreciprocal Ising superconductivity could provide a promising pathway for the development of novel nonreciprocal electronic devices17.Fig. 2 Electrically switchable nonreciprocal Ising superconductivity.

After applying a positive current pulse (Ipulse=+10mA), the polarity of nonreciprocal superconductivity is switched to ΔIc>0, i.e., nonreciprocal supercurrent flowing rightward (left panels). While the negative current pulse (Ipulse=−10mA) favors the reversal to the polarity “-” state, i.e., ΔIc<0 (right panels).

Origin of field-free electrically switchable nonreciprocal superconductivity

We infer that the nonreciprocal Ising superconductivity could result from the intricate interplay among the valley-contrasting Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, the time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by magnetic proximity effect and the lowered rotation symmetry in the PAIS quantum materials. On the one hand, the ubiquitous strain and lattice mismatch at the vdW interface can break the My mirror symmetry of the NbSe2, and lead to in-plane electrical polarization (P). This in-plane P and perpendicular magnetization M of PAIS device can form a magneto-toroidal moment30, leading to magneto-toroidal NDD with nonreciprocal charge transport. When charge current is applied, such lowered lattice symmetry at the interface can give rise to valley-asymmetric Berry curvature distribution, and thus lead to valley magnetization with perpendicular anisotropy, which can generate a spin torque and facilitate the switching of magnetization in PAIS device31. In this case, the magneto-toroidal NDD can be flipped by electric pulse through the flipping of M with P fixed.

On the other hand, with the current along the zigzag direction, the My mirror symmetry of this system can also be broken due to the intricate interplay between valley-contrasting triagonal warping and the magnetic proximity effect (see more detailed discussion in Supplementary Materials). As shown in Fig. 3a, b, an upward magnetization enhances the spin polarization in K valley while decreases the spin polarization in K’ valley. In conjunction with the asymmetric trigonal warping effects present in the two distinct valleys, a finite momentum of Cooper pairs could emerge in NbSe2. Conversely, a downward magnetization gives rise to the non-zero Cooper pairs momentum in an opposite manner (Fig. 3c, d). Notably, such effect is a quadratic effect compared to the fermi energy which dominates the charge transport properties. However, the superconducting gap is several orders smaller than the fermi energy, leading to prominent nonreciprocal quantum transport behavior near the superconducting region where superconducting gap is the dominant energy scale. Such understanding can be further verified by our successful observation of prominent second harmonic behavior near the superconducting transition region (see Supplementary Fig. 6 and Methods for details), which decays fast when the superconductivity is fully suppressed by external magnetic field and the fermi energy becomes the dominate energy scale. To further clarify this mechanism, we employ the generalized Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory3,32 in the proximity to the transition temperature Tc (see methods for details). When the magnetic proximity and trigonal warping effect are considered in the Ising superconductor NbSe2, we demonstrate that the nonreciprocity of superconducting transport is determined by both the external magnetic field Bz and the proximity-induced magnetization Mz, which is consistent with our experimental results shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the nonreciprocal efficiency η is calculated to be proportional to Tc−T1/2, which coincides with our experimental result shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 (see details in Methods). Finally, the calculation shows that the valley-contrasting Ising SOC with triagonal warping effect could also facilitate the generation of current-induced perpendicular spin polarization (see Methods for details), as shown in the inset of Fig. 3e. This current-induced z-spin could also produce a spin torque at the vdW interface and thus contribute to the switching of the magnetization in the PAIS material (Supplementary Fig. 8). It is noted that this electrically switchable nonreciprocal superconductivity is reproducible and observed in the both PAIS devices with odd-layer and even-layer NbSe2 (see Section IX of the Supplementary Materials). Fully understanding of such electrical switching of superconducting nonreciprocity requires microscopic models considering the details of the magnetic proximity effect and the symmetry breaking at the vdW interface27,33–35.Fig. 3 The mechanism for electrically switchable superconducting diode.

Quantum neuronal transistor based on electrically switchable superconducting diode effect

Taking advantage of the electrically switchable nonreciprocal Ising superconductivity, we propose and demonstrate a proof-of-concept quantum neuronal transistor, which can faithfully emulate the biological functionality of a cortical neuron36 in the brain, i.e., performing nonlinear computing operations (Fig. 4a). The neural transistor, a tetrode device shown in Fig. 4b, is operated by feeding input and control signals (represented by X and Y) into the NbSe2 film through the electrodes. The control current pulse signal Y is used for deterministic reversal of the perpendicular magnetization and thus determines the polarity state (“ΔIc>0” and “ΔIc<0” corresponds to state “1” and “0”, respectively) of nonreciprocal superconducting transport. The resulting state would generate a distinct electrical output corresponding to the input current signal X. The output state (“1” or “0”) is represented by the resistance (high or low). To demonstrate the function of the proposed transistor, we switched the polarity state of nonreciprocal superconductivity by applying a train of positive and negative current pulses (denoted as Iswitch) onto this device (Fig. 4c) and measured the resulting output (Fig. 4d). For the probe current Iprobe of +39 μA, the ON-state resistance (RON) corresponding to the polarity “+” state is smaller than 0.004 Ω, whereas the OFF-state resistance (ROFF) corresponding to the polarity “-” state is about 9.8 Ω, giving rise to an on/off ratio of 103. This value is two orders of magnitude larger than that of MgO-based conventional MTJs37–39 and one order of magnitude larger than the state-of-the-art value (19,000%) under similar experimental conditions40. Notably, this ratio depends on the lowest resolution of the measurement system and can be further improved by improving the detection precision. We also note that a superconducting transistor based on the distinct physical mechanism has been theoretically proposed in a Josephson junction with chiral magnet41. Unlike the Josephson transistor based on the junction structure in that work, our proposed superconducting neuronal transistor is realizable in all-metallic junction-free superconductors.Fig. 4 Nonreciprocal neural transistor.

The dashed boxes represent the logic state values for input and polarity combinations (0,1), (1,1), (0,0), and (1,0), respectively.

The quantum neuronal transistor can emulate the biological function of a cortical neuron36 in the brain, which can classify linearly non-separable inputs. As the polarity of nonreciprocity is in “+” state, the transistor exhibits a threshold response behavior due to current induced transition between the superconducting and normal states, and only spikes (i.e. output jumps from state “0” to state “1” and back to state “0”) when receiving negative current pulses of large magnitude (Fig. 4e). In contrast, the transistor with polarity “-” state only spikes when receiving positive current pulses of large magnitude. These threshold response behaviors resemble those features in the cortical neurons capable of executing XOR nonlinear computational functions. Moreover, we show that the neuronal transistor can also realize the function of XOR gate (Fig. 4f). To demonstrate the XOR function, we set the positive current pulse (+39 μA) as input logic state “1” and the negative current pulse (−39 μA) as input logic state “0” in the experiment. As shown in Fig. 4g, when the input state and polarity state are set to (0,1) and (1,0), logic state “1” corresponding to a high resistance can be generated. By contrast, logic state “0” corresponding to a low resistance can be output when the input state and polarity state are set to (0,0) and (1,1). These results indicate that an XOR gate can be realized in a single quantum transistor. Note that this nonlinear Boole logic function cannot be implemented with a single traditional device and is conventionally thought to require multilayered networks42–44. In addition, the PAIS device allows the simultaneous achievement of the giant on/off ratio (>200,000%) and ultralow resistance area product (≈0.1 Ω μm2), which cannot be realized in conventional MTJs (see detailed comparison in Supplementary Fig. 12) but urgently required for ultrahigh-density electronic applications45,46.

Discussion

In summary, we demonstrate field-free electrical switching of Ising superconducting diode effect in the Fe3GeTe2/NbSe2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. By taking advantage of this electrically switchable superconducting diode effect, we propose and demonstrate a nonreciprocal quantum neuronal transistor able to perform the XOR function, which is inaccessible with previously reported technology. Our work opens up a promising avenue for neuromorphic computing based on nonreciprocal quantum transport.

Methods

Device fabrication and fundamental characterization

We mechanically exfoliated the NbSe2 and FGT flakes onto a highly doped Si wafer covered by a 300-nm-thick SiO2 layer. Before the device fabrication, the crystallographic orientation of the NbSe2 flake was characterized by measuring the co-polarized SHG intensity as a function of the relative angle between laser polarization and crystal orientation. In the following fabrication process, we designed the device geometry to set the direction of current along the zigzag direction of the NbSe2 sample in the experiments. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 14, the maximum (minimum) intensity corresponds to the armchair (zigzag) direction of the crystal, confirming the current flowing along the zigzag direction. The thickness of these flakes was identified with optical contrast and a Bruker MultiMode 8 atomic force microscope. The NbSe2 and FGT flakes of a typical PAIS device are approximately 3.1 nm (5 layers) and 28.9 nm in thickness, respectively (see the atomic force microscope images and corresponding height profiles in Supplementary Fig. 1). The bottom electrodes (2 nm Ti/30 nm Au) were patterned using the standard electron beam lithography method and deposited by standard electron beam evaporation. Poly(propylene) carbonate (PPC) coated on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was used to pick up the NbSe2 and FGT flakes and fabricate the heterostructure devices in a glovebox filled with an inert atmosphere to avoid degradation.

Electrical measurements

All the electrical measurements were performed in the Oxford cryostat with magnetic fields of up to 14 T and temperatures between 1.5 and 300 K. To characterize the electric transport state, a Keithley 2636B dual-channel digital source meter or lock-in amplifier (Stanford SR830) was used to inject the d.c. or a.c. current and measure the 4-probe resistance. The a.c. measurements were performed by injecting a.c. current with a frequency of ω (17.777 Hz) using lock-in amplifiers (Stanford SR830). In the measurement of electrical switching of magnetization, large current pulses (write current, 200 μs) were first applied by using Keithley 2636B dual-channel digital source meter. After an interval of 5 s, the Hall resistance was measured using an alternating current excitation current of 500 μA.

Effective tight-binding Hamiltonian

For a NbSe2/FGT heterostructure, the tight-binding Hamiltonian47–50 can be given by1 Hk=εk+hIsingk+hproximity

where εk=−∑j=13{2t1coskj+2t2cos(kj−kj+1)}−μ is the kinetic energy with kj=k⋅Rj, and the unit lattice vectors R1=y^, R2=−y^2−32x^, R3=−y^2+32x^, R4≡R1. Here μ is the chemical potential, t1 and t2 denote the nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hoping integrals, respectively. hIsingk=−βkσz is the energy caused by Ising spin-orbit coupling originated from inversion symmetry breaking of NbSe2, where βk=λI(sink1+sink2+sink3). hproximity=−Mzσz is the energy caused by the proximity effect from the perpendicular magnetization. We set t1,t2,μ,λI=0.009,−0.093,0,0.025eV to fit the electronic band structure from DFT calculations49,51. The band structure and spin texture of NbSe2 for different magnetization states are shown in Fig. 3a, c in the main text. As shown in Fig. 3a, an upward magnetization enhances the spin polarization in K valley while decreases the spin polarization in K’ valley, thereby lifting the valley degeneracy. Conversely, a downward magnetization can lift the valley degeneracy in a opposite manner (Fig. 3c).

Nonreciprocal critical current originated from finite momentum

We employ the generalized Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory3,32 to elucidate the magnetization-determined nonreciprocal superconductivity in our PAIS device. The effective Hamiltonian of PAIS material is given by,2 Hk=εk+hIsingk+hproximity

where εk=ℏ2k22m−μ is the kinetic energy with k=(kx,ky), hIsingk=λIσ3+γkx(kx2−3ky2)σ3 and hproximity=Hzeffσ3 are the energy of the Ising spin-orbit interaction and the magnetic proximity effect, respectively. Here, Hzeff≡Bz+κMz is defined as an effective field contributed from the external magnetic field Bz and the proximity perpendicular magnetization Mz. Here, κ is a constant to ensure dimensional consistency. The effective Hamiltonian H(k) has the mirror symmetry Mx since MxHkMx−1=Hk, but breaks the mirror symmetry My since MyHkMy−1≠Hk.

To derive the microscopic GL free energy, the mean-field Hamiltonian is given by3 HMFΔ,q=12∑kΨ†k,qHk,qΨk,q+const,

where Hk,q=H(k+q)Δiσ2−Δiσ2−Hτ(−k) represents the BdG Hamiltonian and Ψk,q=(ck+q↑,ck+q↓,c−k↑†,c−k↓†)τ is the Nambu spinor. Here, τ denotes transpose.

The free energy density can be expressed as a functional of the superconducting order parameter Δ,4 fsΔ,q≡−TlnTrexp−HMFΔ,qT,

where T is the temperature and the Boltzmann constant kB is neglected for simplicity10. We expanded the free energy density up to the third order of q and the first order of λI and γ, that is,5 fsΔ,q=α0+α2q2+α3qxqx2−3qy2BzeffΔ2+β2Δ4,

where α0=A0(T−Tc), α2=ℏ24m, α3=A3λIγTc2 and β>0 with A0,A3>0 are numerical constants.

For simplicity, we express the above free energy density in a more compact form, fsΔ,q=αqΔ2+β2Δ4, with αq=α0+α2q2+α3qx(qx2−3qy2)Bzeff. Denoting θ as the angle between q and qx axis, i.e., qx=qcosθ and qy=qsinθ, we then can obtain6 αq=α0+α2q2+α3q3cos3θBzeff.

Additionally, the order parameter can be optimized by ∂f∂Δ2=αq+βΔ2=0, i.e., Δ2=−α(q)β with αq<0, leading to7 fsq=−αq22β.

Notice that the momentum dependent current is given by Iq=2∂fs(q)∂q, which is equivalent to β2Iq=∣αq∣∂αq∂q according to Eq. (7). By minimizing αq over q, one can find the Cooper pair momentum q0 in the equilibrium state. With current flowing along the zigzag direction, this current I=Ix^ would change this Cooper pair momentum to qx=q−q0⋅x^, then αqx=α0+α2qx2+α3qx3x^⋅(Bzeff×y^). By minimizing αqx over qx, we find the Cooper pair momentum in the equilibrium state,qx0=2α03α3x^⋅Bzeff×y^,

which is a direct result of the mirror symmetry My breaking. In this case, we can expand αqx around its minimum qx0,8 αq=α0+α2δq2+α~3δq3,

where α~3≡α3Bzeff and δq is define as δq≡qx−qx0. Under this condition, we find the supercurrent is9 β2Iq=2α0α2δq+3α0α~3δq2+2α22δq3+5α1α~3δq4+3α~32δq5.

The critical momentum δqc=∣α03α2∣ is then given by ∂δqIq∣δq=δqc=0. In this way, we can obtain the critical currents Ic± corresponding to δq=∓δqc respectively,10 β2Ic±=4α0329α23α2312±α~3α012+oα052.

As such, the nonreciprocal efficiency is given by11 η≡2(Ic+−Ic−)Ic++Ic−=α34α03α2312Bz+κMz,

showing the temperature dependence (η∝T−Tc12) and magnetism dependence (η∝Bz+κMz) of nonreciprocal efficiency.

Second harmonic signals

We adopted the well-established time-dependent GL equation, as widely used in previous reports3,52, to calculate the second harmonic signal in our device. By introducing a uniform electric field E and setting the vector potential A=-Et, the GL free energy quadratic in the order parameter reads12 F=∫drΔ*r,tαr,tΔr,t=∑qαq,tΔ(q,t)2,

where αq,t is the time-dependent GL coefficient which can be expressed as13 αq,t=α0+α2q−2eℏEt2+α3Hqx−2eℏExtqx−2eℏExt2−3qy−2eℏEyt2.

Here, H is the generalized magnetic field (i.e., H=B+κM) and α3=A3λIγTc2 originated from Ising SOC. The expectation value of the excess current density can be calculated by the time-dependent GL equation with a stochastic force, namely14 ℏD∂Δr,t∂t=−αr,tΔr,t+fr,t,

where D is the damping term for Δ(r,t) resulting from the superconducting fluctuation, and f(r,t) is a stochastic force which generates ⟨∣Δ(q)∣2⟩=kBTα(q). The solution of the time-dependent GL equation is given by15 Δq,t=1ℏD∫−∞tdt′fq,t′exp−1ℏD∫t′tdταq,τ,

which also satisfies the boundary condition αq,∞=0. Then, the expectation value of the order parameter is16 Δq,t2=2kBTℏD∫−∞tdt′fq,t′exp−1ℏD∫t′tdταq,τ.

In analytical mechanics A can enters through the free energy (More generally, the Lagrangian). Considering infinitesimal variations δA, we get δF=−∫drJ⋅δA, an expression used to obtain the current density J. Thus, the current density operator is expressed as17 J(t)=−δFΩδA=1Ω∑q−∂αq,t∂AΔq,t2=1Ω∑qJq,tΔq,t2

with Ω is the volume of the system. The expectation value of the current density is18 Jt=2kBTcΩℏD∑q∫−∞tdt′Jq,t′exp−1ℏD∫t′tdταq,τ.

By applying Eqs. (13), (18), we can obtain the conductivity as19 J=σ1E+σ2FE,

where σ1=e216ℏTcT−Tc and σ2=−πe3mα3H+oH364ℏ3kBTcTcT−Tc2. In this context, FE=(Ex2−Ey2,−2ExEy) denotes the nonlinear term of the in-plane electric field. As expected, σ2 encapsulates the second harmonic signal, which is prominent near the superconducting transition where the small superconducting gap dominates the electrical transport.

We then performed the second harmonic measurement3,53 with sweeping the perpendicular magnetic field at 4.5 K, which corresponds to the superconducting transition regime, for both magnetization “UP” and “DOWN” states. To distinguish the linear and nonlinear component, both the first (Rω) and second harmonic signals (R2ω) of the longitudinal magnetoresistance (Supplementary Fig. 6) are measured using a lock-in amplifier and applying the a.c. excitation current with an amplitude of 8 μA. The superconducting state fades off by increasing the magnetic field, manifested as the magnetoresistance in Supplementary Fig. 6a. We note that the magnetoresistance dip can be shifted to the left or right when the magnetization is reversed from “UP” to “DOWN” state, again indicating the presence of the proximity-induced exchange field κM from the magnetization of FGT. We then extracted the value of κM=±10mT, which is consistent with the critical field BC at which the ΔIc vanishes for magnetization “UP” and “DOWN” state (Fig. 1e and Fig. 1g). In addition, the result that the R2ω is antisymmetric with respect to the perpendicular magnetic field and magnetization (Supplementary Fig. 6b), i.e., R2ω−Bz,MDOWN=−R2ω(Bz,MUP), which is consistent with the magneto-toroidal nonreciprocal effect. Notably, the second harmonic signal decays fast as the external magnetic field further increases, and the fermi energy becomes the dominant energy scale. This phenomenon confirms the important role of trigonal warping effect on the nonreciprocal superconducting transport in our PAIS device.

Temperature dependence of nonreciprocal superconducting transport

We swept the direct current and monitored the change in resistance under various temperatures ranging from 1.6 to 3.5 K when fixing the magnetization “DOWN” state in a PAIS device with 7-layer NbSe2 (Supplementary Fig. 7a). For each temperature, we observed significant nonreciprocal supercurrent with polarity “+” state (represented as ΔIc<0). To further clarify the temperature dependence of this nonreciprocal effect, the temperature dependence of nonreciprocal efficiency η=2Ic++Ic−Ic+−Ic− are clearly plotted in Supplementary Fig. 7b. With increasing the temperature, this nonreciprocal efficiency η decreases and its temperature dependence is well fitted by a 1−TTc function (the critical temperature Tc=4.8K see in Supplementary Fig. 7c), consistent with the theoretic analysis (see Methods: Nonreciprocal critical current originated from finite momentum).

Current-induced spin polarization

The coexistence of Ising SOC and trigonal warping at the Fermi surface can also facilitate the generation of current-induced perpendicular spin polarization. Specifically speaking, the electric field generated from the charge current would change the trigonally warped Fermi surfaces of spin-up and spin-down branches in both K and K’ valleys and thus lift the valley degeneracy. This valley population imbalance would generate a z-spin polarization (the inset of Fig. 3e), which could produce a spin torque at the vdW interface and thus switch the magnetization in the PAIS material (Supplementary Fig. 8). To further elucidate the current-induced z-spin polarization, we calculated the current contribution to spin polarization using the Boltzmann equation34,54 as follows.

The effective Hamiltonian of a monolayer NbSe2 can be written as20 Heffk=ℏ2k22m+γkxkx2−3ky2τ3,

where τz=±1 represent the valley degrees of freedom. Straightforward diagonalization of this Hamiltonian gives the eigenvalues21 ε±k=ℏ2k22m±γkxkx2−3ky2,

and eigenvectorsψk,+=10eik⋅r,

ψk,−=01eik⋅r.

For simplicity, we consider a line in the Brillouin zone along the kx direction (i.e., ky is a good quantum number). Solving the equation ε±kF,±=εF to first order in γ gives22 kF,±≈kF1∓mγkFℏ2≡kF1∓ξ,

with ξ=mγkFℏ2. Introducing an external electric field E could displace the Fermi surfaces by an amount Δk±=−eEτ±ℏ, where τ± are the different energy-dependent scattering rates. Generally, one can assume that τ±=τ(1±ξ) with τ the relaxation time of the free-electron gas55.

Then we calculate analytically the current contribution from each subband using the Boltzmann equation34,54, one can obtain23 J±=−e∫vk,±∂fk,±∂εevk,±τ±⋅Edk=e2τ±4π2ℏ∬vk,±vk,±vk,±⋅EdSF±,

where fk,± and SF± are the electron distribution function and Fermi surfaces for the ± bands, respectively. By choosing E=Ex^ and assuming vF,±=vF, one can further get24 Jx,±=e2τ±E4π2ℏ∫02πvFcos2ϕkF,±dϕ=e2E4πℏvFkF,±τ±,

where we apply the relation k=k(cosϕ,sinϕ,0). Thus, the total current density is given by25 J=Jx,++Jx,−=e2E2πℏvFkFτ1+ξ2.

The spin expectation value reads26 Sk,±=ψk,±Sψk,±=00±1.

Therefore, the spin density can be calculated in an analogous way as27 δS±=∫δS±∂f∂εevk,±τ±⋅Edk=∓eE2πℏkF,±τ±z^,

which yields the total spin density28 δS=δS++δS-=2eEπℏkFτξz^.

Consequently, from the two Eq. (25) (28), we can obtain29 δS≈4m2γeℏ3Jz^.

Here, we set γ = 6.09 × 10−21 J m3 based on the previous literature28 and obtain the relation of current induced spin density shown in Fig. 3e.
