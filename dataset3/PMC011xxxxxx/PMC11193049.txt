﻿Abstract

Poxyaibamberus Andersen & Dantas, gen. nov. is erected based on the males of two species, P.jamanximensis Andersen & Dantas, sp. nov. from Jamanxim National Park, Pará State, Brazil, and P.ubajarensis Andersen & Dantas, sp. nov. from Ubajara National Park, Ceará State, Brazil. Both species have a comparatively short and wide head, with large eyes and short, five-segmented palps; a strong subapical seta on the ultimate flagellomere; scalpellate acrostichals; no setae on the wing veins except for one seta on the brachiolum; a long costal extension; and a large triangular anal point and a very long heel on the gonostylus. The systematic position of the new genus is briefly discussed.

The number of orthoclad species known from Brazil has increased rapidly during the last three decades. In their catalog of the Neotropical and Mexican chironomids Spies and Reiss (1996) recorded eight Orthocladiinae species in six genera from Brazil; one of these, Ichthyocladiusneotropicus Fittkau, 1974, was listed as uncertain and has later been proven to not occur in Brazil (Mendes et al. 2004). Today more than 144 species in 44 genera are known to occur in the country (Pinho et al. 2024), although there is still a significant gap in the North and Northeast regions, where only 23 and 14 species of Orthocladiinae have been recorded. Many orthoclads encountered in Brazil do not readily fit into any described genus, and many new genera have been described. Several genera, namely Gynocladius Mendes, Sæther & Andrade-Morraye, 2005; Oleia Andersen & Mendes, 2007; Saetherocladius Andersen & Mendes, 2007; Saetherocryptus Andersen & Mendes, 2007; Saetherolabis Andersen & Mendes, 2007; Saetherops Andersen & Mendes, 2007; Lyrocladius Mendes & Andersen, 2008; Ubatubaneura Wiedenbrug & Trivinho-Strixino, 2009; Iporangomberus Mendes & Andersen, 2012; Pebapomberus Mendes & Andersen, 2012; Miambera Andersen & Mendes, 2012; Maximberus Andersen & Mendes, 2012; Jururumberus Mendes & Andersen, 2013; Uirassubrillia Mendes, Andersen & Pinho, 2013; Caaporangombera Andersen, Pinho & Mendes, 2015; Mariambera Andersen, Mendes & Pinho, 2015; and Urubicimbera Andersen, Pinho & Mendes, 2015 are so far endemic to Brazil (Mendes et al. 2005, 2013; Andersen and Mendes 2007, 2012a, 2012b; Mendes and Andersen 2008, 2012a, 2012b, 2013; Wiedenbrug and Trivinho-Strixino 2009; Andersen et al. 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). However, several of these genera are expected to be more widely distributed when the chironomid fauna of neighboring countries is better studied.

Below we describe a new genus based on the males of two new species collected in Pará and Ceará states in northern and northeastern Brazil. Both species have a comparatively wide head with large eyes and short, five-segmented palps, a strong subapical seta on the ultimate flagellomere, scalpellate acrostichals, a long costal extension, no setae on the wing membrane and veins except for one seta on the brachiolum, a large triangular anal point, and a gonostylus with a very long heel. The systematic position of the new genus is briefly discussed.

﻿Materials and methods

The specimens were collected with Shannon traps (Shannon 1939) or light traps and preserved in 80% ethanol during the fieldwork. Prior to examination they were mounted in Euparal following the procedure outlined by Sæther (1969). Morphological terminology follows Sæther (1980). Coloration is based on the slide mounted specimen.

For the phylogenetic analysis we have used a morphological character matrix with 45 taxa and 83 characters. Characters were sampled from larvae, pupae, and adult males and females. Fossils were of course underrepresented in terms of characters available for observation (see https://github.com/chironomus/Poxyaibamberus-). The character matrix for the phylogenetic analysis was built using NEXUS DATA EDITOR v. 0.5. 0 (Page 2001).

First, a Bayesian analysis of the morphological matrix alone in MRBAYES 3.2.2. (Ronquist et al. 2012) was conducted using the Bayesian implementation of Lewis’ Markov models (Lewis 2001). In Bayesian inference, two Markov chains were run simultaneously for 10 million generations using a discrete Dirichlet distribution with equal state frequencies (Lewis 2001). Substitution model was set to “gamma” (Nylander et al. 2004). The first 25 0000 generations were discarded as a burn-in (number of MRBAYES generations of the tree topology before the apparent stationary condition) (Nylander et al. 2004). Consensus trees showing all compatible groups and 50% compatible groups were computed in MRBAYES. Ancestral character state analysis was conducted on the allcompat consensus tree based on morphology alone using ANCTRESH in the PHYTOOLS package v. 0.7-80 (Revell 2012). R code for this analysis, alongside the data is provided in https://github.com/chironomus/Poxyaibamberus-.

To deal with the uncertainty of the positions of the genus on the tree caused by the lack of knowledge of character states, the Klopfstein and Spasojevic ROGUEPLOTS approach was applied (Klopfstein and Spasojevic 2019). A morphological allcompat tree from MRBAYES (as described above) was used to place Poxyaibamberus into the high posterior probability regions. ROGUEPLOTS for every species and accompanying R code are provided in the https://github.com/chironomus/Poxyaibamberus-.

Both holotypes are kept in the Invertebrate collection at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia (INPA), Manaus, Brazil.

Immatures and female. Larva, pupa, and female are unknown.

Etymology.

The epithet, jamanximensis, is used as an adjective and meaning “from Jamanxim” in reference to the place of origin of the holotype.

Distribution.

The species is only known from the type locality in Jamanxim National Park, Pará State, in northern Brazil, where it was collected in a Shannon trap placed near a lower-order stream. Only a single male was collected despite intensive sampling effort during the expedition with successive sampling using several types of traps. According to data from the National Institute for Space Research, the Jamanxim National Park ranks among the conservation units with the highest deforestation rates in the Amazon. This situation underscores the need to increase the knowledge of the biodiversity in this region to better understand the anthropogenic impacts on the biota and to utilize this knowledge as tools for developing conservation strategies. The discovery of a new genus of Chironomidae in the park highlights the importance of further research to understand and preserve its unique biodiversity.

Immatures and female. Larva, pupa, and female are unknown.

Etymology.

The epithet, ubajarensis, is used as an adjective and meaning “from Ubajara” in reference to the place of origin of the holotype.

Distribution.

The species is known only from the type locality in the Ubajara National Park in northeastern Brazil. The park covers an area of 6.288 ha and receives abundant rainfall, averaging 1.400 mm annually, while temperatures typically range between 22 °C and 26 °C. The vegetation in the park is characterized by its high diversity, with higher elevations adorned by lush humid forests (Figueiredo 1997; Souza 1997). Lower elevations feature semi-deciduous tropical rainforest on sloping areas and arboreal Caatinga (thorny deciduous forest) in the lower regions. The specimens were collected using a light trap placed about 20 m upstream of a waterfall (Fig. 5) at an elevation of 805 m a.s.l. At the sampling time, water temperature was 21.5 °C, pH was 7.05, and electric conductivity was 137.6 µS/cm.

﻿Discussion

In a consensus tree produced in the Bayesian analysis neighboring search, Poxyaibamberus falls out with Mesosmittia Brundin, 1956, Pseudosmittia Goetghebuer, 1932, Eretmoptera Kellog, 1900, Thalassosmittia Strenzke & Remmert, 1957, and Petalocladius Sublette & Wirth, 1972 (Fig. 6). Both Pseudosmittia, with more than 100 species, and Mesosmittia, with 18 species, are distributed in most parts of the world (Ferrington and Sæther 2011; Ashe and O’Connor 2012). The Neotropical species have been treated by Andersen et al. (2010) and Andersen and Mendes (2002). However, a position close to Thalassosmittia, Eretmoptera, and Petalocladius is notable. Thalassosmittia has 11 named species distributed in the Afrotropical, Nearctic, Neotropical, and Palaearctic regions (Ashe and O’Connor 2012). With few exceptions, Thalassosmittia representatives are marine shore dwellers (Andersen et al. 2013). However, the only Thalassosmittia described from the Neotropical Region is T.amazonica Andersen & Pinho, 2014, which was collected in the Amazon rainforest near Manaus (Andersen and Pinho 2014). Eretmoptera is a genus with two named species that are distributed in the Nearctic Region and in Antarctica. The adults are wingless. Eretmopterabrowni Kellog, 1900 is distributed in California, while E.murphyi Schaeffer, 1914, was described from the island of South Georgia and is later introduced to Signy Island in the South Orkney Islands (Ashe and O’Connor 2012). The species is apparently parthenogenetic; the larva has a two-year life cycle and lives in damp moss and peat where they are thought to feed on decaying vegetation (Cranston 1985; Convey 1992). Petalocladius, with two included species, is distributed on the Caribbean Islands Jamaica and Hispaniola (Andersen et al. 2024). Both species have been collected in mountainous areas, and P.dominiensis Andersen & Baranov, 2024 was trapped close to a rather rapid, small river with rocky and stony substrates.

This is a majority-rule consensus tree based on morphology only.

https://binary.pensoft.net/fig/1068976

When posterior position probability mapping (“Rogue plots”) was applied, Poxyaibamberus was plotted in approximately 20% of the cases next to Stictocladius Edwards, 1931 and in approximately 20% of the cases next to Pseudosmittia / Eretmoptera (Fig. 7). While these were the most frequent positions within the generated trees, it plots near Eretmoptera in the consensus tree due to cumulatively more frequent occurrence (ca 40%) in or near this clade (Fig. 6). The position of Stictocladius in relation to Poxyaibamberus remains highly uncertain due to the lack of knowledge of the immature stages of the new genus. It is difficult to elaborate on the character distribution in the tree, as we have used an mcmc-based Bayesian approach, rather than maximum parsimony, which precludes more detailed analysis of the characters distribution. We have used the Bayesian approach, rather than maximum parsimony because of a deficiency in knowledge of many characters in the new genus. Thus, a more detailed analysis of the character distribution and sister relationships of Poxyaibamberus will have to wait until description of the additional life stages of the genus.
