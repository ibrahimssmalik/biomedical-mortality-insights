The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article after concerns were raised about some of the data reported. Specifically, there is evidence of a potential splice in each of the FoxM1 and RFC5 blots presented in Fig. 6C. The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the reliability of the data presented.

Ai-hua Gong agrees with this retraction. The remaining authors did not respond to correspondence from the Publisher about this retraction.
