pmcCorrection to: Nature Communications 10.1038/s41467-024-47387-1, published online 12 April 2024

The original version of this article and the Supplementary Information file contained an error in figures 4D, 5A, 6A, 7, and 8, as well as Supplementary Figs. 18–22, 47, and 68–72. In the original version of these figures and Supplementary Figures, the formyl group was incorrectly connected to the alpha nitrogen of the amino group for N-formyl-L-kynurenine and the derived compounds. The correct connection of the formyl group is the indolic nitrogen clśose to the aromatic ring. These have been corrected in both the PDF and HTML versions of the article, and the HTML version of the Supplementary Information.
