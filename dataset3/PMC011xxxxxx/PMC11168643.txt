Background

A rapid screening test for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children is needed to avoid unnecessary cultures and provide prompt reports to make appropriate clinical decisions. We have evaluated for the first time the performance of the Sysmex UF-5000 flow cytometer as a screening tool for UTIs in children.

Methods

This study included 4445 pediatric patients, with urinary sediment and urine culture data collected from January 2020 to September 2023. The Sysmex UF-5000 analyzer was utilized to measure urine white blood cell (WBC) and bacteria (BACT), with the findings being compared to the culture results.

Results

At ≥ 104 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL, 513 samples were culture-positive (400 samples presented 104–105 CFU/mL, and 113 demonstrated ≥ 105 CFU/mL bacterial growth). Optimal indicators for positive cultures were BACT counts of 92.2/μL (AUC: 0.944) and WBC counts of 40.8/μL (AUC:0.863). False negative rate were 0.9% when using a 7.8 bacteria/μL cut-off and avoiding unnecessary cultures in 28.1%. The UF-5000 has a higher consistency rate for Gram-negative (GN) bacteria (90.3%) than Gram-positive (GP) bacteria (86.8%). For samples with 105 CFU/mL, UF-5000’s Bacteria -Information flags showed superior concordance for samples with 104−105 CFU/mL bacteria.

Conclusions

Screening pediatric urine cultures with the UF-5000 showed potential application value in identifying negative cultures and significant bacterial growth, although performance may vary depending on the study population. Furthermore, detecting Gram typing aids in guiding early clinical empirical medication, particularly for UTIs caused by GN bacteria.

pmcIntroduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases during childhood [1, 2]. The clinical signs and symptoms of UTIs in children are complex and diverse, and urinary symptoms in infants and young children are not obvious. If not treated promptly, it can readily progress to nephritis and even renal failure [3]. Urine culture remains the gold standard technique for the species identification and diagnosis of UTIs [4]. However, this method usually requires 2 to 3 days for final reporting, which does not meet the requirements for rapid clinical diagnosis. Moreover, clinical microbiology laboratories commonly receive culture-negative specimens, which increases the workload [5, 6]. In addition, it is more difficult for children to retain midstream urine than adults, and improper collection is more likely to lead to contamination and hence false positive results. Therefore, a rapid screening test for UTIs in children is needed to avoid unnecessary cultures and provide prompt reports to make appropriate clinical decisions.

Previously, due to the unavailability of timely laboratory results, clinicians would usually administer antibiotic treatments empirically without supportive laboratory evidence, which led to the overuse of antibiotics and increased the risk of drug resistance [7]. Therefore, rapid and accurate pathogen identification is crucial for effective anti-infection treatments.

Urine dipsticks are frequently utilized as a fast initial screening test, despite having limited sensitivity(SE) [8, 9]. Flow cytometry, a technique capable of distinguishing and quantifying various particles (including bacteria) in urine, offers an alternative approach for rapidly screening UTIs. The Sysmex UF-5000 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan), a third-generation fully automated urine flow cytometer, is a notable advancement over its predecessor, the UF-1000i (Sysmex). The most significant enhancement is the addition of a new parameter for bacterial information (BACT-Info) in the UF-5000, which distinguishes bacterial Gram-staining subtypes based on their different uptake of pigments through cell wall structure.Gram-positive (GP) bacteria have a thicker peptidoglycan layer, leading to increased forward scattered light intensity (FSC) and less pigment penetration, resulting in lower lateral fluorescence intensity (FL), and tend to be located in regions with larger angles on scatter plots. Conversely, Gram-negative (GN) bacteria have a thinner peptidoglycan layer, producing weaker FSC and allowing more pigment penetration, resulting in higher FL, and are typically found in flatter areas with smaller angles.

In recent years, some studies have shown that among the 17 parameters available for urine analysis on the Sysmex UF-5000, white blood cell (WBC) counts, BACT counts and BACT-Info are the most useful for UTI diagnosis [6, 10–13]. However, the results exhibit high heterogeneity due to differences in patient populations, specimen types, and selected thresholds for significant counts in culture. Most previous studies have focused on adult samples. Consequently, this study explored the screening performance of the novel UF-5000 fluorescence flow cytometer, specifically in pediatric UTIs, and its ability to differentiate Gram typing of bacteria in UTI samples using new parameters.

Materials and methods

Patients and specimen collection

A total of 4445 pediatric patients with urinary sediment and urine culture information were retrospectively analyzed at Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University between January 2020 and September 2023. Among the patients, 2424 (54.5%) were male and 2021(45.5%) were female. Hospitalized patients accounted for 4183 (94.1%), and 262 (5.9%) were outpatients. The median age was 2 years (range, 0–17 years). The specimen collection was completed clinically, and clean midstream urine samples were collected from toilet-trained children. In contrast, young infants who had not yet been toilet-trained had their samples collected in a sterile collection bag after careful washing of the genitals, with urine flow being monitored. All specimens were collected in two ordinary sterile test tubes for i) urine culture and ii) flow cytometry analyses. Samples were transported to the laboratory within 2 h of collection.

Urine culture and identification of microbes

Inoculation involved using a calibrated loop to apply 10μL of well-mixed urine specimen onto blood agar and chocolate agar plates for quantitative cultivation. All plates were incubated for 18–24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. If there was bacterial growth, the colonies were counted. If there was no growth, cultivation continued for 48h.BACT counts ≥ 104 CFU/mL were considered culture positive, BACT counts < 104CFU/mL raised suspicion of contamination [14]. The urine was classified as contaminated if three or more colonies without a predominant organism were observed, representing the diagnostic standard for pediatric patients in the author’s institution. Bacteria were identified using a Microscan WalkAway 96 Plus automatic bacterial identification instrument (SIEMENS, Germany).

Sysmex UF-5000 analysis

This instrument uses flow cytometry to detect sediment in urine. Based on nucleic acid fluorescence staining principles and semiconductor laser flow cytometry, it can provide 14 conventional quantitative and qualitative detection parameters and 3 clinical parameters, such as detailed information on red blood cells, conductivity information, and BACT-Info [15]. As with the previous analyzers in the UF-Series (UF-100 and UF-1000i), the UF-5000 is very useful in screening and identifying UTIs. Moreover, BACT-Info displays as "Gram-positive?" [GP], "Gram-negative?" [GN], "Gram-pos/neg?" [GP/GN] or "Unclassified." Thus, in addition to providing the same information as traditional Gram staining, the UF-5000 offers a faster and simpler alternative.

Statistical analysis

The GP and GN discrimination results from the UF-5000 were compared with urine culture results. Continuous variables were expressed as medians and ranges. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables between the two studies. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed, and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of BACT and WBC counts for UTIs. SE, specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated at different BACT cut-offs using urine culture as a reference. The largest Youden index (SE+ SP-1), was utilized to determine the optimal cut-off points for distinguishing positive and negative samples. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software (version 23.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL), and all figures were created with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Ethics statements

According to the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, this study received approval from the Ethical Committee of Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University (SDFE-IRB/T-2023095) and commenced data on December 29, 2023.The authors were granted access to identifiable participant information during the data collection process.

Results

UF-5000 BACT and WBC counts

Of 4445 urine cultures, 3443 (77.5%) displayed no growth, 435 (9.8%) exhibited growth of <104 CFU/mL of bacteria, 400 (8.9%) showed growth between 104−105 CFU/mL, and 113 (2.5%) presented growth ≥105 CFU/mL of bacteria. Fungal growth was detected in 54 (1.2%) samples.

The distribution of BACT and WBC counts with the UF-5000 under different colony counts in urine cultures is shown in Fig 1. The median of bacteria was 8.8/μL (range: 0–42566.2/μL) for the group with no growth, 18.8/μL (range: 0–43647.0/μL) for the <104 CFU/mL group; 2166.2/μL (range: 1.0–89503.1/μL) for the 104–105 CFU/mL group; and 6183.3/μL (range: 5.2–90908.6/μL) for the ≥ 105 CFU/mL group. BACT counts in all groups were significantly higher than in samples without growth (P < 0.001). Similarly, when classified by colony counts in urine culture, the median of WBC was 10.2/μL (range: 0–24851.3/μL) for the no-growth group, 12.7/μL (range: 0–16674.3/μL) for the <104 CFU/mL group, 188.4/μL (range: 0.4–55528.2/μL) for the 104–105 CFU/mL group, and 292.3/μL (range: 0.5–44706.6/μL) for the ≥ 105 CFU/mL group. In samples with bacterial growth (104–105 and ≥ 105 CFU/mL), the WBC counts were significantly higher than those in samples without growth (P < 0.001).

Microbial species

We identified 513 culture-positive samples. Among these, 471 samples (91.8%) were identified as single microorganisms (303 samples [59.1%] with GN bacteria and 168 samples [32.7%] with GP bacteria). In 42 samples (8.2%), two microorganisms were isolated, 17 cultures presented mixed GN and GP bacterial growth, and 25 showed two GN bacteria. The microorganisms isolated reflected the usual rate of uropathogens in our laboratory. The most frequently reported bacteria were GNs, constituting 60.6% of all species isolated, with Enterobacterales being the majority. GP pathogenic bacteria are mainly attributed to Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. Yeast growth was observed in 54 samples, of which 27 were Candida albicans and 15 were Candida tropicalis (Table 1).

Diagnostic performance of UF-5000

Excluding samples from the fungus culture and the < 104 CFU/mL group, a ROC curve is presented in Fig 2 for Sysmex UF-5000 BACT and WBC counts, with urine cultures as the reference. The AUC for UF-5000 in BACT counts was 0.944 (95% CI: 0.933 to 0.956) higher than the AUC for WBC counts;0.863 (95% CI: 0.846 to 0.881).

(with positive cut-off value at 1 × 104 CFU/mL).

We evaluated the SE and SP of the UF-5000 BACT counts. The largest Youden index showed that the best cut-off value for UF-5000 BACT counts on the ROC curve was 92.2/μL, resulting in a SE of 86.0% (95% CI: 0.827 to 0.889), SP of 91.4% (95% CI: 0.905 to 0.924), and approximately 79.6% as unnecessary urine cultures, with 14.6% false-negative results. The results are summarized in Table 2. To minimize false negatives, we imposed higher sensitivities (90%, 95%, and 99%) as a condition, yielding cut-off values of 47.5 bacteria/μL, 13.5 bacteria/μL, and 7.8 bacteria/μL, with corresponding false negative rates of 9.7%, 4.5%, and 0.9%, respectively. As shown in Table 2, when the maximum SE was reached, the bacterial count indicated that UF-5000 could eliminate 28.1% of unnecessary cultures.

Specificity %	91.4	85.6	66.4	32.3	
Negative Predictive value (NPV) %	97.7	98.3	99.0	99.6	
Positive Predictive value (PPV) %	59.8	48.3	29.8	17.9

True positives (n)	438	463	490	508	
False positives (n)	294	495	1156	2332	
True negatives (n)	3149	2948	2287	1111	
False negatives (n)	75	50	23	5	

At the 7.8 bacteria/μL cut-off, five false negatives were identified: four samples with growth of GP cocci and one sample with mixed growth of two GN bacteria. At the 13.5 bacteria/μL cut-off, 23 false negatives were observed: 15 GP cocci and 8 GN bacteria.

WBC count also plays a vital role in detecting UTIs and assessing treatment effectiveness because it provides an estimate of asymptomatic bacteriuria or contamination due to infection [6]. We determined a general cut-off point of 40.8 WBCs/μL, providing the most significant area under the ROC curve and the best Youden index. The SE, SP, PPV, and NPV were 80.7% (95% CI: 0.770 to 0.840), 77.8% (95% CI: 0.761 to 0.792), 96.5%, and 35.2%, respectively.

Performance evaluation of UF-5000 in distinguishing GP and GN bacteria

The discrimination results of UF-5000 BACT-Info flags versus urine culture are shown in Table 3. Samples with less significant growth or fungus growth were excluded. Of the total specimens, based on the gold standard of midstream urine cultures, the total consistency rate of UF-5000 for distinguishing UTIs is 92.0% (3638/3956), the consistency rate for determining GN in urine is 90.3% (3572/3956), the SE is 61.6% (202/328), the consistency rate for GP is 86.8% (3434/3956), the SE is 38.1% (64/168), the consistency rate for GP/GN is 85.2% (3372/3956), and the SE is 11.8% (2/17). For samples with ≥ 105 CFU/mL bacteria, “Gram-negative?” UF-5000 BACT-Info flags showed a better concordance of 74.1% (60/81) compared to 104−105 CFU/mL bacteria, with 57.5% (142/257) concordance. Similarly, 53.4% (16/30) of urine cultures with growth ≥ 105 CFU/mL of GP bacteria showed higher concordance than urine cultures with 104−105 CFU/mL 34.8% (48/138) (Table 3). Over a third of samples with bacterial growth at < 105 CFU/mL exhibited "unclassified" flags.

Discussion

Urine culture remains the gold standard for diagnosing UTIs. However, the testing cycle is long and unsuitable for early diagnosis. It necessitates establishing a rapid and accurate primary screening method for UTIs in children. This is the first study to compare the application value of the new-generation Sysmex UF-5000 flow cytometry in children with bacterial UTIs with urine cultures. It was also the most significant number of analyzed urine samples among the UF-5000 studies, with 4445.

In this study, positive urine culture results were 13.0% (513/3956). This result is lower than that reported in previous studies involving adults, researchers report 20% -40% of positive cultures in most studies [6, 12, 13, 16], but 10.4% in one study of children [17], aligning with our laboratory results. The reasons for this variance may be due to the non-specific clinical manifestations of children, making the diagnosis of UTIs in the pediatric population challenging. The use of antibiotics in children before specimen collection may lead to false negatives in traditional culture results [14]. In addition, children are unlikely to retain urine for an extended period, and bacteria may not have enough time to reproduce in the bladder if urine remains for less than 4 hours.GN bacteria predominated in positive cultures, accounting for 60.6%, of which most were Escherichia coli. Therefore, as described in previous studies [2, 3, 18–20], Enterobacterales especially E. coli, cause UTIs in most children. Enterococcus is the second most common pathogen in our study, accounting for 27.4%, which may be attributed to the predominance of hospitalized patients, aligning with literature that typically describes Enterococcus as a pathogen associated with hospitalization [8, 21].

We compared the BACT and WBC counts detected by the UF-5000 under different bacterial colony counts in urine. The findings suggest a strong correlation between UF-5000 BACT, WBC counts, and standard urine culture results. In other words, those with higher colony counts also have higher BACT and WBC counts. The BACT and WBC counts in the samples with bacterial growth 104–105 and ≥ 105 CFU/mL were significantly higher than those with no growth (P < 0.001). Although there were statistically significant differences in BACT counts in the < 104 CFU/mL group, no significant increase in WBC counts was observed compared to the no-growth group, a low risk of UTI and a high risk of colonization or contamination are the most likely explanations.

Previous studies have shown high variability in proposed cut-off points for the Sysmex auto analyzer, which is probably related to each center’s different UTI diagnosis criteria, disease prevalence rates, and study samples sources.

For BACT and WBC counts in urinary samples, a recent study showed that UF-5000 exhibited acceptable SEs (96.1% and 91%) and lower SPs (32.2% and 28%) at 100 bacteria/μL and 21 WBCs/μL, respectively [16]. In another study, a BACT count at a cut-off of 135/μL, the SE and SP were 92.1% and 85.4%. Furthermore, there was a WBC cut-off of 23 /μL, and the SE and SP were 73.5% and 84.1% [12]. Our optimal cut-off points for positive urine culture results, following the criterion of the largest Youden index, would be 92.2/μL for BACT (SE: 86.0%, SP: 91.4%) and 40.8/μL for WBC (SE: 80.7%, SP: 77.8%). There is no standardized cut-off point for urine screening, and each laboratory should set its threshold dependent on the patient’s history and the specific criteria for urine culture.

ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC of the WBC counts was 0.863 and that of the BACT was 0.944, indicating that both the WBC and BACT counts have diagnostic values for UTIs. However, in our evaluation of UF-5000, we found a higher AUC for BACT than for WBC, as shown in previous studies [13, 22, 23]. In other words, the WBC count was less effective than the BACT count for screening UTIs. The results of our analysis determined data on the SE and SP of different UF-5000 BACT count cutoffs. With the best cut-off value, the percentage of unnecessary urine cultures was approximately 79.6%; however, the false negative rate was 14.6%. Given this, our laboratory selects lower cut-off values to achieve a higher sensitivity to screen for UTIs. With 7.8 bacteria/μL set as the threshold, the false negative rate is only 0.9%; there were 1111 samples with < 7.8 bacteria/μL and culture-negative. When BACT counts were done with the UF-5000 first, 1111 samples (28.1% of the total specimens) would not require culture if there were no more than 7.8 bacteria/μL in the urine sample. This would reduce the costs of urine culture and workload.

Additionally, there is substantial variability between the various studies published in this field. Alenkaer et al. reduced unnecessary cultures by 30% with 99% sensitivity [11]. However, De Rosa et al. reached 55% [6]. In addition, Toledo et al. reduced unnecessary cultivation by 40% at a sensitivity of 95% [16], but these data are all from studies on adults. Our laboratory achieved a 57.8% reduction in unnecessary cultivation at a sensitivity of 95%.

It should be noted that most of our false negative cultures were GP cocci, accounting for 80% (4/5) and 65.2% (15/23), respectively. This phenomenon may be related to the tendency of GP cocci to form bacterial aggregates, which interfere with cytometer readings. Toledo et al. [16] and Manoni et al. [24] reported that GP cocci were obtained from over half of the urine samples that were false-negative. This finding is consistent with our conclusions.

Based on previous results, the UF-5000 also provides information on bacterial Gram staining. We evaluated the performance of the UF-5000 in distinguishing GP and GN bacteria. Considering all the samples collectively, our study showed that the total consistency rate of UF-5000 for determining UTIs is 92.0%, indicating that the culture results and bacterial detection by the UF-5000 are highly consistent. Furthermore, GN and GP had 90.3% and 86.8% coincidence rates, respectively, and 61.6% and 38.1% sensitivity, respectively; similar results were reported by Kim et al. [10]. The consistency rate for GP/GN is 85.2%, and the sensitivity is 11.8%,compared to individual bacterial infections, UF-5000 is less effective at subtyping mixed UTI infections. According to our research, the UF-5000 is more sensitive to GP and GN bacteria in UTIs with 105 CFU/mL bacterial growth than with 104–105 CFU/mL bacteria, indicating that samples with lower counts produced inaccurate results, reported as "unclassified."

It’s worth noting that for samples with significant growth, the SE of the UF-5000 bacterial channel to detect GP bacteria was also low (< 60.0%). This contrasts with previous studies [10, 12], which have indicated a higher rate of missed diagnosis in GP screening for the UF-5000. The results showed that the detection ability of UF-5000 was better for GN bacteria than GP bacteria, given that GN bacteria are the primary causative pathogens of UTIs. The UF-5000 has good detection ability for GN bacteria and can guide clinicians to empirically choose antibiotics for UTI treatment, thereby improving the optimal treatment timing.

In summary, the UF-5000 demonstrates clinical utility in screening urine cultures for significant bacterial growth. While the potential use of its generated BACT counts in excluding UTIs and reducing unnecessary urine cultures, its effectiveness may depend on the study population. We recommend a BACT count cut-off of 7.8/μL for screening out patients with negative cultures. In contrast, before the results of urine cultures, clinicians may use BACT counts and classifications as supplementary information in deciding whether to treat with antibiotics in patients with urological issues.

This study had some limitations. It was conducted at only one center, therefore, multicenter studies involving larger sample sizes are necessary to validate our results. A substantial number of samples showed ≤105 CFU/mL bacterial growth, and due to the random selection of these samples, it cannot be ruled out that most patients have been treated with antibiotics before their hospital visit. Therefore, comprehensive patient history and clinical assessment are crucial. Future research, particularly in children, is needed to optimize cutoff values and develop appropriate algorithms for effectively applying the UF-5000 in clinical practice.

5. Review Comments to the Author

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: This is a very interesting study testing the Sysmex UF-5000 as a screening tool for UTI in children.

Zhe authors included 4445 patient informations and compared the BACT and WBC counts received by the UF-5000 with the measured data in the laboratories. The bacterial counts in the laboratory was classified as „no growth“, <10*4 CFU/ml, 10*4-10*5/ml, and >10*5/ml. The authors calculated for each parameter the usual statistical parameters, like sensitivity and specificity, negative and positive predictive values etc. Depending on the Cut-off BACT they could calculate these statistical parameters with the results, how many urine cultures would have been most likely unnecessary. Because they also could differentiate with high probability between most likely GN and GP cultures, these results would also be important if empiric antibiotic therapy was to be chosen. The authors compared their results with other studies as well, however, most of them were performed in adults. They also discussed well the limitations of their own study.

Overall, the study was well performed and presented. I only have (minor) comments/questions. Unfortunately the lines of the manuscript are not numbered.

1. Concludions: I like that the authors write Gram usually with capital letter, because it is the name of a person. In Conclusion it should also be written with capital letter.

2. Urine culture and identification of microbes.“If there was sterile growth“. Although the authors used 10 µl for urine culture, also in case of no growth, one cannot say ir is sterile. Therefore, better: „If there was no growth“.

Table 2. Typing error: Tocal? Maybe should read Total. It was used 3 times.

Otherwise I have no further comments.

Reviewer #2: Urinalysis is a very important issue in most laboratories worldwide. In the last decades automated urine particle analyzers have reduced microscopic examinations and unnecessary cultures. In their study, Liu P et al. investigated the performance of the UF-5000 fluorescence flow cytometer especially in pediatric urinary tract infections.

This report has some merit because of the pediatric study population. The manuscript is well written, however, before publication in this journal some minor points should be considered:

• Abstract (methods): “We analyzed 4445 patient information of children….” This sentence should be rewritten in a better and more informative way.

• Ethics statement: “And began accessing data on December 29, 2023. The author had access to information that could identify individual participants during data collection…” This part should be rewritten in a better English.

• Results/Microbial species: “C. tropical” should be spelled out to “Candida tropicalis”

• Table 1: “Proteus mirabili” should read “Proteus mirabilis”

• Results/Diagnostic performance of UF-5000: “Excluding samples from the fungus culture and the <104 CFU/mL group, an ROC curve…” should read “…, a ROC curve…”

• The “limitations” should be mentioned before the conclusion.

Reviewer #3: The manuscript “Enhancing clinical decision-making: Sysmex, UF-500 as a screening tool for urinary tract infections in children” is interesting and confirms/validates in a large cohort, previous findings on the utility of flow cytometry for detection of UTI. Several studies have evaluated the performance of the UF-5000 in different kinds of patient cohorts but as this study is the first on a large cohort of children, it brings new knowledge to front. The paper needs some revision before publishing.

DETAILED COMMENTS

Q1: Abstract, Results. The author mentions that unnecessary culture could be avoided in 28.1%. Are there a reason for presented the numbers with 3 digits? Why not say 28%. I hardly think the estimates is that precise?

Q2: Abstract, Conclusion. Cultures screened with UF-5000 showed superior results in identifying…superior in comparison to what? I don’t think you mean compared to urine culture? Or do you mean compared to previous flow cytometry models like UF-1000 or compared to Urine stricks? The UF-5000 may be faster than culture but not better. It may also be better that other fast screening methods.

Q3: Introduction/discussion. The authors mention that rapid screening test for UTI is needed for children. But there is nothing mentioned about urine dipsticks that are ruinously used in many settings for rapid screening, including in children >2 years of age. Is that because the dipsticks are not used at this children’s’ hospital? It may be worth mentioning that there are a lot of rapid screen test on the marked, but they do show inadequate performance compared to culture.

Q4: Urine Culture: Inoculation involved using a calibrated loop to apply 10 µL culture. It is common to use a 1-μL inoculating loop, so can you elaborate on the choice of the 10 µL loop? It may be a good point to include in your discussion as many of the studies you compare uses 1 µL loop cultures and therefore you may not compare to the same culture standard.

Q4: Urine culture. BACT counts≥104CFU/mL should be changed to BACT counts≥104 CFU/mL. Do the sentence BACT counts ≥104CFU/mL (when symptomatic) where considered positive, mean that samples with ≥104CFU/mL where excluded if the patient did not have any symptoms? I don’t think you can exclude culture positive samples from the dataset, at least not without mentioning this a an exclusion criteria. Also how where ≥103CFU/mL classified? As negative? You may stick to the recommended cut-off urine cultures in children at ≥104 CFU/mL.: 1999. Practice parameter: the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children. American Academy of Pediatrics. Committee on Quality Improvement. Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection. Pediatrics 103:843-852

Q5: Results UF-5000 BACT and WBC count and Figure 1. You mentioned in caption to fig.1 that fungi are excluded. Why is that? Are fungi defined as culture negative or positive? You need to define this or explain the rationale about excluding them. Fungi is a non-bacterial UTI.

Q6: You identified 513 samples with significant growth. I think you should use the same term in the manuscript for culture positive. So may change the sentence to 513 culture positive samples.

Q7: Diagnostic performance of UF-5000. Again rationale for excluding samples with fungi.

Reviewer #4: This study investigated the performance of Sysmex UF-5000 analyzer parameters for screening urinary tract infection (UTI) in children. I believe the manuscript should be rejected due to the following reasons:

1、 The manuscript is poorly organized and its readability needs to be extensively improved.

2、 The language quality does not meet the publication criteria of PLoS ONE.

3、 The authors should provide more details about the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the patient enrollment.

4、 I suggest the authors use a flowchart to depict participant selection.

5、 How to handle duplicated participants?

6、 The type of data collection (retrospective or prospective) should be reported.

7、 The sample sizes of UTI and non-UTI were not reported.

8、 In table 2, the rate of missed diagnosis should be reported.

9、 The novelty and strength of this study were not well discussed in the discussion section.

Minor comments

1、The upper limit of AUC’s confidence interval should not exceed 1.

2、The 95% confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity should be reported

Reviewer #5: The authors report on the performance of the Sysmex system for diagnosing urinary tract infections among children from one hospital in China. The diagnostic method is valid and can reduce time to result and laboratory workload by reducing the number of unnecessary urine cultures. To better understand and interpret the findings, the authors should add more detail on the setting, study design and patient population. Further comments below.

Introduction

- Improper collection is more likely to lead to contamination and hence false positive results

- Comment on the use of dipstick test for UTIs in children (given that it also provides rapid results and is very cheap)

- When introducing Sysmex, please add the manufacturer and location

- Explain to the reader by which mechanism can the Sysmex differentiate between Gram positive and Gram negative organisms

Methods

- “If there is sterile growth” please rephrase to no growth or similar

- Describe what symptoms were considered and how the data were collected

- Add some information about where the study was conducted including some background about the setting, on the study design, prospective or retrospective, and on the approach for enrolling patients, alternatively whether data were obtained from medical records. Also include some data on the patient population to add with the interpretation of findings (enterococci were relatively common, Candida is usually considered a contaminant – were a considerable proportion of patients immunosuppressed)

- Data analysis: state in the text for which two parameters Sensitivity and specificity were computed

Results

- Add percentages in the first paragraph

- No need to list the SE for the ROC curve AUC

- Explain in the methods how the “best” cut-off was selected for calculating Sensitivity and specificity

- Would a combination of using WBC by Sysmex and Bacterial count improve test performance.

- “… based on the gold standard of midstream urine cultures, the total compliance rate of UF-5000 for distinguishing UTIs is…” Please note that when considering your definitions in the methods section, not all growth represents a UTI (some may be asymptomatic bacteriuria). If necessary correct for clarity. Also please clarify what is meant by “compliance rate”

- Explain what “unclassified flags” are

Discussion

- The yield of urine cultures is quite low. Comment in more depth on possible reasons (in adults yield can be higher than 40% reaching 70-80%). Similarly the prevalence of Gram-negatives was relatively low (one would expect that more than 60% of samples would have Gram negative growth) – comment on possible reasons.

- Replace Enterobacteriaceae with Enterobacterales

- When setting cut-off values for sensitivity and specificity consider that these can also be population-dependent as well as depend on the strategy the authors decide to use for setting the cut-off (better sensitivity vs better specificity vs Youden). These might explain the slight differences between studies and there might not be a “best” cut-off in this scenario (results apply to this specific study, as you discuss in the next sentence).

- “We recommend a BACT count cut-off of 7.8/uL for screening out patients with negative cultures, especially if they have no clinical symptoms of UTI.” – should these patients be tested at all if asymptomatic?

- Include the limitations before the conclusion

Tables and Figures

- Table 1: replace ratio with proportion, italicise species names, list in the footnote what other Gram positives and Gram negatives were isolated, also for other Fungus (other fungi); Proteus names is misspelled, consider that Candida can be a contaminant

- Table 2: add space between number and parantheses. There is typo for specimens in the first cell also for “total”

Dear Editor and Reviewers,

We have provided a detailed response to this section in “Response to Reviewers”.The revised portions are mark by “Track Change” in red font throughout the revised manuscript.

Reviewers' comments:

Reviewer #1

1. Conclusions: I like that the authors write Gram usually with capital letter, because it is the name of a person. In Conclusion it should also be written with capital letter.

Reply: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, in the conclusion, the word “gram “was replaced with “Gram”.

2. Urine culture and identification of microbes. “If there was sterile growth”. Although the authors used 10 µl for urine culture, also in case of no growth, one cannot say it is sterile. Therefore, better: “If there was no growth”.

Reply: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we use " If there was no growth " instead of " If there was sterile growth " in the revised manuscript.

3. Table 2. Typing error: Tocal? Maybe should read Total. It was used 3 times.

Otherwise I have no further comments.

Reply: Thank you for pointing out these errors. We have made the necessary corrections and conducted a thorough review of the spelling in the document.

Reviewer #2

1. Abstract (methods): “We analyzed 4445 patient information of children….” This sentence should be rewritten in a better and more informative way.

Reply: We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's feedback and have revised this section based on the suggestions provided. The revised portions are indicated by 'Track Changes' in red font in the updated version of our manuscript.

2. Ethics statement: “And began accessing data on December 29, 2023. The author had access to information that could identify individual participants during data collection…” This part should be rewritten in a better English.

Reply: We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's feedback and have revised this section based on the suggestions provided. The revised sections are highlighted with 'Track Changes' in red font in the revised version of our manuscript.

3. Results/Microbial species: “C. tropical” should be spelled out to “Candida tropicalis”

Reply: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments. In accordance with the reviewer's recommendation, we have updated the terminology in our manuscript to use “Candida tropicalis” instead of “C. tropical”.

4. Table 1: “Proteus mirabili” should read “Proteus mirabilis”

Reply: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we use " Proteus mirabilis " instead of " “Proteus mirabili " in the revised manuscript.

5. Results/Diagnostic performance of UF-5000: “Excluding samples from the fungus culture and the < 104 CFU/mL group, an ROC curve…” should read “…, a ROC curve…”

Reply: Thank you for pointing this out. We have corrected these grammar mistakes mentioned above and have carefully reviewed the language throughout the document. 6. The “limitations” should be mentioned before the conclusion.

Reply: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments and have adjusted the order of these two parts as suggested.

Reviewer #3

1.Abstract, Results. The author mentions that unnecessary culture could be avoided in 28.1%. Are there a reason for presented the numbers with 3 digits? Why not say 28%. I hardly think the estimates is that precise?

Reply: We appreciate the reviewer's feedback on our work. In order to minimize false negatives, a higher sensitivity of 99% was applied as a condition. The unnecessary cultures percentage was calculated as True Negative divided by the Total Number, resulting in 0.280839231547 (1111/3956). The information is presented in Table 2, where we have rounded the numbers to one decimal place to highlight subtle differences in the data. This approach was particularly important for metrics like negative predictive value (NPV) %. Therefore, we ensured consistency by consistently using one decimal place throughout the entire analysis process.

2.Abstract, Conclusion. Cultures screened with UF-5000 showed superior results in identifying…superior in comparison to what? I don’t think you mean compared to urine culture? Or do you mean compared to previous flow cytometry models like UF-1000 or compared to Urine stricks? The UF-5000 may be faster than culture but not better. It may also be better that other fast screening methods.

Reply: The reviewer's feedback is greatly appreciated. Our research found that cultures screened with UF-5000 demonstrated superior results in identifying negative cultures. Specifically, the consistency between UF-5000 BACT-Info flags indicating 'Unclassified' and negative urine cultures was 97.9% (3370 / 3443) Table 3). Moreover, Cultures screened with UF-5000 showed superior results in identifying significant bacterial growth, Specifically, For samples with ≥105 CFU/mL bacteria, “Gram-negative?” UF-5000 BACT-Info flags showed a better concordance of 74.1% (60/81) compared to 104-105 CFU/mL bacteria, with 57.5% (142/257) (highlighted in green in Table 3).Similarly, 53.4% (16/30) of urine cultures with growth ≥105CFU/ml of GP bacteria showed higher concordance than urine cultures with 104–105CFU/ml 34.8% (48/138) (highlighted in blue in Table 3). This sentence is indeed ambiguous, we appreciate the feedback provided and have revised the expression in the section accordingly, the revised portions are mark by “Track Change” in red font in the updated version of our manuscript.

3. Introduction/discussion. The authors mention that rapid screening test for UTI

is needed for children. But there is nothing mentioned about urine dipsticks that are ruinously used in many settings for rapid screening, including in children >2 years of age. Is that because the dipsticks are not used at this children’s’ hospital? It may be worth mentioning that there are a lot of rapid screen test on the marked, but they do show inadequate performance compared to culture.

Reply: Our hospital predominantly utilizes the UC-3500 urine dry chemical analyzer for testing with dipsticks. This study focuses on exploring the new parameter of bacterial information provided by the UF-5000, and reduce unnecessary cultures based on bacterial count. We appreciate the reviewer for providing valuable feedback, which serves as a helpful reminder for our future research endeavors. In our next investigation, we plan to delve deeper into the joint testing of UC-3500 and UF-5000. As pointed out by the reviewer, the urine dipstick serves as a rapid screening test, and we have incorporated comments on its application for UTIs in the introduction of our revised manuscript.

I concur with the reviewer's observation that the UF-5000 may be faster than culture but not better. Urine culture remains the gold standard for diagnosing UTIs。 and these contents are also reflected in the discussion.

4.Urine Culture: Inoculation involved using a calibrated loop to apply 10 µL culture. It is common to use a 1-μL inoculating loop, so can you elaborate on the choice of the 10 µL loop? It may be a good point to include in your discussion as many of the studies you compare uses 1 µL loop cultures and therefore you may not compare to the same culture standard.

Reply: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments. Based on the health industry standard WS/T489-2016 of the People's Republic of China regarding 'Laboratory Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections', section 8.4.1 on Selection of Culture Types and section 10 on Interpretation of Results, it is recommended to use either a 1μL or 10μL inoculating loop. However, our hospital currently does not have the 1μL loop and therefore we typically use the 10µL loop. It is worth noting that while using the 10µL loop does not impact the judgment criteria. Furthermore, the 10μL loop can be effectively reused after proper sterilization with an alcohol lamp, offering a cost-saving measure. Please refer to the industry standard guidelines for more detailed information.

8.4.1 Selection of Cultivation Types

The clean midstream urine culture method involved inoculating 1μL or 10μL onto blood agar plates, MacConkey or Chinese blue agar plates. All plates were incubated for 18-24h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. If there was bacterial growth, the colonies were counted. If there was no growth, cultivation continued for 48h.

10 Result interpretation

10.1 Summary: With a 1μL inoculum, the count results in plate colony count×103 CFU/mL. With a 10μL inoculum, the count results in plate colony count×102CFU/mL. Clinical physicians are advised to analyze the clinical significance of urine culture results in conjunction with urine routine results.

10.2 General explanation: Following quantitative cultivation of clean midstream urine, a single bacterial colony count ≥ 105CFU/mL may indicate infection, while <104CFU/mL may be contamination. The range of 104CFU/mL to 105CFU/mL requires evaluation based on the patient's clinical manifestations. These parameters are usually sufficient for accurate diagnosis of most cases of pyelonephritis and cystitis.

In conclusion, while various specifications of inoculating loop are employed, the judgment criteria remain consistent post-conversion.

5. Urine culture. BACT counts ≥ 104CFU/mL should be changed to BACT counts ≥ 104 CFU/mL. Do the sentence BACT counts ≥ 104CFU/mL (when symptomatic) where considered positive, mean that samples with ≥ 104CFU/mL where excluded if the patient did not have any symptoms? I don’t think you can exclude culture positive samples from the dataset, at least not without mentioning this an exclusion criteria. Also how where ≥ 103CFU/mL classified? As negative? You may stick to the recommended cut-off urine cultures in children at ≥ 104 CFU/mL.: 1999. Practice parameter: the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children. American Academy of Pediatrics. Committee on Quality Improvement. Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection. Pediatrics 103:843-852

Reply: Culture positive samples were not excluded from the dataset, and all children with BACT > 104 CFU/mL were included in the research. We acknowledge the reviewer's feedback and have made the required revisions, as well as cited relevant articles in our manuscript. The revised sections are highlighted with 'Track Changes' in red font on pages 5-6 of the original text. Following industry standards where ≥ 103 CFU/mL is considered contamination, data with BACT < 104 CFU/mL were not included in the results of the second to fourth parts.

6. Results UF-5000 BACT and WBC count and Figure 1. You mentioned in caption to fig.1 that fungi are excluded. Why is that? Are fungi defined as culture negative or positive? You need to define this or explain the rationale about excluding them. Fungi is a non-bacterial UTI.

Reply: We appreciate the valuable feedback provided by the reviewer. It is important to note that fungi are considered a non-bacterial UTI, with the corresponding parameter in the Sysmex UF-5000 being YSL counts. While fungi are typically identified through culture positivity, our research parameters, specifically BACT counts and BACT-Info, primarily focus on bacterial UTIs. Additionally, the percentage of fungal samples in our study was relatively low at 1.2% (54 out of 4445 samples). Therefore, we made the decision to exclude fungal data in order to maintain the scientific integrity of our analysis. At present, we have not conducted a correlation study between fungal UTIs and YSL counts parameter due to the limited volume of available data. In order to express our research content more clearly, we have made modifications to the title：Enhancing clinical decision-making: Sysmex UF-5000 as a screening tool for bacterial urinary tract infections in children.

7. You identified 513 samples with significant growth. I think you should use the same term in the manuscript for culture positive. So may change the sentence to 513 culture positive samples.

Reply: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we use " 513 culture positive samples " instead of " 513 samples with significant growth. " in the revised manuscript.

8. Diagnostic performance of UF-5000. Again rationale for excluding samples with fungi.

Reply: We appreciate the reviewer's comments and have incorporated corresponding explanations in question 6.

Reviewer #4

1.The manuscript is poorly organized and its readability needs to be extensively improved.

Reply: Thank you for your feedback. We have thoroughly revised the manuscript based on the reviewer's comments. We believe that our response and revisions address the concerns raised and enhance the quality of the publication. We hope that the revised version meets the standards for publication. The revised sections are mark by “Track Change” in red font throughout the revised manuscript.

2.The language quality does not meet the publication criteria of PLoS ONE.

Reply: Thank you for your feedback. we have employing a professional scientific editing service to help us language editing.

3.The authors should provide more details about the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the patient enrollment.

Reply: This retrospective study utilized data extracted from medical records. Urine culture was employed as the reference standard for the research. To assess the performance of Sysmex UF-5000, it was imperative to ensure that the detection outcomes from both methods were derived from the same urine sample for comparability. Initially, data was gathered from pediatric patients who underwent urine sediment and urine culture tests on the same day. Subsequently, only the initial test results for each patient were retained based on their ID. Patients who underwent examinations on the same day but at different times, determined by the specific time of collection, were then excluded from the analysis. Finally, 4445 childrens were included in the study.

4.I suggest the authors use a flowchart to depict participant selection.

Reply: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments. Based on the reviewer's suggestion, we have incorporated a flowchart in the supporting information to describe the selection of participants.

5.How to handle duplicated participants?

Reply: we will only retain the first test data for each patient based on their unique patient ID.

6.The type of data collection (retrospective or prospective) should be reported.

Reply: As a retrospective study, this detail has been included in the methodology section.

7.The sample sizes of UTI and non-UTI were not reported.

Reply: Thank you for your feedback. Based on the health industry standard WS/T489-2016 of the People's Republic of China regarding 'Laboratory Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections' and reference[14]：BACT counts ≥ 104 CFU/mL were considered culture positive, BACT counts < 104CFU/mL raised suspicion of contamination [14]. The urine was classified as contaminated if three or more colonies without a predominant organism were observed, representing the diagnostic standard for pediatric patients in the author's institution. We divided 4445 children into the following groups(In Response to Reviewers).

This study aims to validate the performance and intended use of the novel UF-5000 fluorescence flow cytometer. The findings will be compared to culture results to evaluate the accuracy of the UF-5000 in discriminating between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, research results were not grouped according to UTI and non-UTI categories, but instead, utilizing grouped data for analysis can provide a clearer demonstration of our research results.

8.In table 2, the rate of missed diagnosis should be reported.

Reply: According to the reviewer's feedback, we have added the missed diagnosis rate, which is the false negative rate in Table 2.

9.The novelty and strength of this study were not well discussed in the discussion section.

Reply: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments. The Sysmex UF-5000, a third-generation fully automated urine flow cytometer, a new function is its ability to distinguish gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in urine samples. The majority of previous studies have focused on adult samples. To this end, we a
