Following publication of the original article [1], the authors would like to update Fig. 2 as they claimed to have used the wrong figure file. As a result, there is a duplication on Figs. 2e and 3a. The correct and incorrect Fig. 2 are given below.

The incorrect Figure:

Fig. 2 Gastric emphysema and pneumatosis intestinalis, marmoset, HE. a, b Stomach, case (1) c Stomach, case (2) d Duodenum, case 1. The gastric and duodenal mucosa contain numerous empty spaces, which are gas cysts. e Liver, case (1) Abnormal dilation of the portal vein suggests hepatic portal venous gas. f Liver, case (2) There are numerous rods, neutrophil infiltration, and liver cell necrosis around the main trunk of the portal vein

The correct Figure:

Fig. 2 Gastric emphysema and pneumatosis intestinalis, marmoset, HE. a, b Stomach, case (1) c Stomach, case (2) d Duodenum, case 1. The gastric and duodenal mucosa contain numerous empty spaces, which are gas cysts. e Liver, case (1) Abnormal dilation of the portal vein suggests hepatic portal venous gas. f Liver, case (2) There are numerous rods, neutrophil infiltration, and liver cell necrosis around the main trunk of the portal vein
