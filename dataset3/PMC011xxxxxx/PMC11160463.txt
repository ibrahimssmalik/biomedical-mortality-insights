Heterotrophic nitrifiers continue to be a hiatus in our understanding of the nitrogen cycle. Despite their discovery over 50 years ago, the physiology and environmental role of this enigmatic group remain elusive. The current theory is that heterotrophic nitrifiers are capable of converting ammonia to hydroxylamine, nitrite, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, and dinitrogen gas via the subsequent actions of nitrification and denitrification. In addition, it was recently suggested that dinitrogen gas may be formed directly from ammonium. Here, we combine complementary high-resolution gas profiles, 15N isotope labeling studies, and transcriptomics data to show that hydroxylamine is the major product of nitrification in Alcaligenes faecalis. We demonstrated that denitrification and direct ammonium oxidation to dinitrogen gas did not occur under the conditions tested. Our results indicate that A. faecalis is capable of hydroxylamine production from an organic intermediate. These results fundamentally change our understanding of heterotrophic nitrification and have important implications for its biotechnological application.

Heterotrophic nitrification produces hydroxylamine from an organic intermediate, without subsequent biological conversion to N2.

Nitrogen is a key element for life on Earth. It is present in many molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. The most abundant form of nitrogen is dinitrogen gas (N2), which however is not available to most organisms. Instead, they take up more reactive forms of nitrogen, mainly ammonium (NH4+). While reactive nitrogen is often limiting in natural ecosystems, its anthropogenic input continues to increase (1). This can have detrimental effects on ecosystems, as an excess of reactive nitrogen causes eutrophication and the release of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) (2). Therefore, there is a need for continued efforts to understand the microbial transformations in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle.

NH4+ is the primary source of nitrogen for most organisms. In its deprotonated form, ammonia (NH3) is also used as an energy source by nitrifying bacteria and archaea (3). Nitrification is the stepwise oxidation of NH3 via hydroxylamine (NH2OH) to nitrite (NO2−) and further to nitrate (NO3−). In soils, NH4+ is relatively well retained by the negatively charged soil particles. However, the negatively charged NO2− and NO3− ions are more susceptible to runoff and leaching, and nitrification thus impairs fertilizer efficiency and increases eutrophication of receiving water bodies. NO3− can be lost from the environment through denitrification, the stepwise reduction of NO3− to NO2−, nitric oxide (NO), N2O, and lastly N2 (4). Denitrifiers use the intermediates of this pathway as alternative electron acceptors instead of oxygen (O2). Thus, denitrification is a common anaerobic respiration strategy for microorganisms in oxygen-limited environments. The existing body of research on nitrification suggests that this is primarily an autotrophic process (3, 5, 6) performed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. In addition, complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) accomplish both steps within a single organism (7, 8). It is well-recognized that substantial amounts of N2O can be produced during nitrification (5, 9, 10). In part, this is due to a process called nitrifier denitrification, which occurs under low O2 availability. However, a full canonical denitrification pathway is absent from known nitrifiers, and large parts of the N2O production are probably due to detoxification of NH2OH by cytochrome P460 (11).

More controversial is the physiology of heterotrophic nitrifiers. Some soil bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12) and Arthrobacter siderocapsulatus (13, 14) have been found to produce NO2− from NH2OH and aldoximes (15, 16). Others, such as Arthrobacter globiformis (17), Paracoccus pantotrophus (18), Alcaligenes faecalis (19), and Pseudomonas putida (20) were found to produce NH2OH, NO2−, and NO3− from NH4+. The intense dispute surrounding heterotrophic nitrification results from the lack of understanding of the underlying biology. In AOB and AOA, ammonia (NH3) is oxidized via the sequential actions of ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase (HAO). Energy is conserved from the electrons released during the oxidation of NH2OH to NO2−. In contrast, this could not be verified for NH4+ or NH2OH oxidation in heterotrophic nitrifiers (21, 22). Nonetheless, several publications report the isolation of AMO- and HAO-like proteins from P. pantotrophus (23–25), Pseudomonas PB16 (26), A. faecalis (27), and Acinetobacter Y16 (28). AbrB-family transcriptional regulators have been suggested as putative AMO proteins due to a proposed structural similarity in P. putida (20). However, a recent study in A. faecalis showed that abrB knockout mutants did not lose the ability to oxidize NH3 (29). Still, it is commonly presumed that heterotrophic nitrification occurs through a similar mechanism as in canonical nitrifiers (30).

Strikingly, apart from A. globiformis, most described heterotrophic nitrifiers were also reported to be capable of denitrification under oxic conditions. Robertson and Kuenen (31) proposed a role for heterotrophic nitrification to generate electron acceptors for aerobic denitrification. The rationale for this theory is that denitrification under oxygen-limited conditions could stimulate faster turnover of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The measured effect of this strategy was an increase in growth rate, albeit at the cost of growth yield. Some heterotrophic nitrifiers were found to be capable of simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification (HNAD) (32, 33). This results in the removal of NH4+ through denitrification, without additional biomass yield. This trait is regarded as particularly interesting for biological nitrogen removal in high nitrogen-containing wastewater treatment systems (34). For example, A. faecalis was reported capable of efficiently removing nitrogen from high-strength NH4+ wastewater by HNAD (35, 36).

A. faecalis was first described over a century ago (37, 38) and is commonly found in soil, freshwater, and wastewater environments. On multiple occasions, A. faecalis was found to nitrify NH4+, thereby producing NH2OH, NO2−, NO3−, NO, N2O, and N2 (19, 33, 39). Contrary to expectations, NH2OH accumulated in these cultures, and it has been claimed that the oxidation of NH2OH is therefore of little significance (40). The formation of NO2− is argued to be largely pH dependent (40, 41) and may be linked to oxime formation. Free NH2OH can react with aldehyde groups of small organic molecules, for instance forming pyruvic oxime from pyruvate. It was found that A. faecalis uses an enzyme called pyruvic oxime dioxygenase (POD) to oxidize pyruvic oxime, yielding pyruvate and NO2− (42, 43). Furthermore, Tsujino and coworkers (42) showed that POD homologs are found in several proteobacteria capable of heterotrophic nitrification, which could therefore be an explanation for the observed production of NO2− by heterotrophic nitrifiers.

The exact mechanism by which A. faecalis mediates the conversion of inorganic nitrogen remains a subject of debate, and the nature of NO, N2O, and N2 formation still is uncertain. A. faecalis was shown to be capable of denitrification under aerobic conditions (33). However, this was not found to occur simultaneously with heterotrophic nitrification (19, 44). Instead, Otte and coworkers (44) suggested that NO2− was not denitrified, but N2O was a direct byproduct of NH2OH oxidation and was subsequently reduced to N2. Recent research suggests that Alcaligenes species are capable of direct NH4+ oxidation to N2, with NH2OH as intermediate (45, 46). This direct oxidation of NH4+ and NH2OH is thought to be catalyzed by a process termed direct nitrogen formation (DNF), encoded by the dnfABCD gene cluster. The dnfA gene encodes a diiron oxygenase and was reported to mediate the oxygen-dependent conversion of NH4+ or NH2OH. In agreement with this hypothesis, Xu and coworkers (29) reported that dnfAB knockout mutants of A. faecalis were unable to produce NH2OH and, therefore, N2. However, purified DnfA was demonstrated to bind NH2OH but not NH4+ (47), and recent research proposed a function in the hydroxylation of the amide group of glutamine to form glutamic acid hydroxamate in addition to NH2OH oxidation to N2 (48). Hence, the role of the Dnf system in NH4+ and NH2OH oxidation remains to be investigated further.

In this study, we set out to characterize the nitrogen turnover reactions occurring in A. faecalis. We used a complementary combination of advanced cultivation methods and gas analysis in combination with 15N isotope labeling, genomics, and transcriptomics. Thereby, we deliver a comprehensive overview of the inorganic nitrogen metabolism of A. faecalis. Furthermore, we provide strong indications that the reported DNF by A. faecalis is likely due to abiotic processes.

RESULTS

Genome reconstruction and annotation

To enable transcriptome studies, the genome of A. faecalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 8750 was sequenced. Hybrid assembly of long- and short-read sequencing data yielded a 4,072,866–base pair (bp) circular genome of A. faecalis ATCC 8750 with 124× coverage, a G+C content of 56.6 mole percent (mol %), and a total of 3718 coding sequences (CDSs). The genome contained three complete ribosomal RNA operons and 58 transfer RNAs, one to five for each of the 20 amino acids. Our assembly compared well to that of other A. faecalis genomes (16 complete genomes, as of February 2023), which, on average, were 4.16 Mb in size, had a G+C content of 56.6 mol %, and contained 3724 CDSs. The presence of plasmids was not investigated, which has been reported for some strains (49).

NH4+ uptake and assimilation are encoded by an NH4+ transporter gene (amtB), two genes encoding the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhA), and the glutamine synthetase/glutamate 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase pathway (glnA and gltBD). These pathways are regulated by a set of nitrogen-regulatory P-II proteins (GlnB>, GlnD, GlnE, and GlnK). In addition, global control of the nitrogen and carbon metabolisms of the cell is mediated by the phosphotransferase system (PTS) and PTSNtr systems (RpoN, PtsN, PtsO/NPr, ManX, PtsI, and PtsH, but not PtsP).

Genes homologous (>90% amino acid identity) to the dnf cluster in Alcaligenes ammonioxydans (45) are present in A. faecalis. This cluster comprises dnfABCD and the upstream dnfT1T2RT3. Also, POD and two homologs (PODh1 and PODh2) with 44.5 and 48.2% amino acid identity to POD, respectively, were identified. An AbrB family transcriptional regulator is encoded, which had been proposed to be involved in NH4+ oxidation in P. putida (20). However, as mentioned above, the function of the AbrB protein as AMO was recently disproven (29).

In addition, the genome of A. faecalis contained all genes necessary for denitrification from NO2− to N2, but not for NO3− reduction to NO2−. Genes for NO2− and quinol-dependent NO reduction are colocalized on the genome (nirK and norBR, respectively), followed by a Crp/Fnr family transcriptional regulator resembling NnrR. N2O reduction is encoded by nosRZDFYL. We did not find evidence of a NirS-type nitrite reductase, in contrast to another strain of A. faecalis (50).

A. faecalis has multiple genes that deal with nitrosative stress. Next to nitric oxide reductase (norZ), the genome also contains a cytochrome bd–type oxidase and a flavohaemoprotein, encoded by cydAB and hmp, respectively. Cytochrome bd–type oxidases have been implicated with nitrosative stress resistance due to their high NO dissociation rate (51). Furthermore, katA and katE encode catalases that may be involved in NO2− detoxification to NO3− (52, 53). Glutathione production and salvage are encoded by gshA, gshB, and ggt and are involved in numerous stress responses.

Growth and gas production under nitrifying conditions

A. faecalis produced N2O and N2 in batch incubations under all tested conditions (fig. S1), concurrent with CO2 production (fig. S2). In addition, NO production was observed under carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios of 8 and 4. Incubations that contained NH2OH evolved N2O and N2 before the onset of CO2 production, indicating the abiotic decay of NH2OH (fig. S1). The final optical densities at 600 (OD600) were 0.203 ± 0.02, 0.463 ± 0.02, and 0.557 ± 0.04 for C/N 20, 8, and 4, respectively.

15N stable isotope labeling

Nitrification and growth of A. faecalis were observed under all conditions where NH4+ was added and were not inhibited by the addition of NO2− or NH2OH (Fig. 1 and fig. S3). Again, the production of NH2OH, NO2−, N2O, and N2 coincided with the production of CO2. Incubations supplied with NH4Cl as the sole source of nitrogen consumed in total 47 ± 2 μmol NH4+ and produced up to 6.5 ± 1.2 μmol NH2OH, 1.9 ± 0.2 μmol NO2−, 1.6 ± 0.1 μmol N2O-N, and 1.7 ± 0.1 μmol N2-N.

Results are shown for A. faecalis grown in the presence of stable isotope-labeled nitrogen compounds. NH2OH was added to the respective incubations at t = 1. (A) Incubations performed in the presence of NH4+ (dotted lines) or NH4+, NH2OH, and NO2− (solid lines), amended with 15N-labeled 15NH4+ (green) or 15NH2OH (purple). (B) Incubations with NH4+ and NO2− (top; dotted lines) and additionally with NH2OH (bottom; solid lines), amended with 15N-labeled 15NH4+ (green), 15NH2OH (purple), 15NO2− (blue), or 15NH4+ and 15NO2− (orange). Data points and error bars represent the mean and SDs, respectively, of three biological replicates.

NH2OH was produced from NH4+ and reacted in a biomass-independent manner to yield N2 and N2O, but not NO2− (Fig. 1A). In sterile incubations, NH2OH reacted with itself to form 44N2O and presumably 28N2 (not measured) when 14NH2OH was supplied or 46N2O and 30N2 when 15NH2OH was supplied. Cells fed with 15NH2OH in the presence of 14NH4+ additionally produced 44N2O, 45N2O, and 29N2, resulting from the biological conversion of 14NH4+ to 14NH2OH (Fig. 1A). No reaction was observed between NH2OH and NO2− under sterile conditions (Fig. 1A).

The production of 46N2O and 30N2 was dependent on the addition of 15NH2OH or 15NH4+ (Fig. 1B). Denitrification did not occur, as indicated by the lack of conversion of 15NO2− to 46N2O and 30N2. However, active cells fed with 15NO2− and 14NH2OH produced 45N2O, which was not observed under sterile conditions. This suggests that NO2− was reduced to NO, which subsequently reacted with NH2OH to form N2O.

The abiotic reaction of NO with NH2OH was verified under sterile oxic conditions, where 14NO declined rapidly, leading to the production of 45N2O in the presence of 15NH2OH (fig. S4). 46N2O and 30N2 were formed independently of NO disappearance, and 30N2 production was higher in mineral medium (MM) than in ddH2O. Furthermore, 46N2O production occurred only in MM, showing that this reaction depends on constituents of the medium, most likely metals.

Chemostat culture

Cells cultured in continuous culture produced 87 ± 12 and 90 ± 16 μM NH2OH, and 364 ± 54 and 150 ± 15 μM NO2− at C/N 8 and 4, respectively (Fig. 2). NO3− concentrations remained under the detection limit of the assay (2.5 μM) but might have been masked by the high NO2− concentrations. No production of NH2OH and NO2− was observed at C/N 20. The protein yields at C/N 4 and 8 were comparable (14.8 ± 1.1 and 14.8 ± 1.7 μg protein ml−1, respectively), while at C/N 20, the culture reached a lower protein content (5.2 ± 0.7 μg protein ml−1), indicating that the cells were experiencing nitrogen limitation.

Fig. 2. Inorganic nitrogen production and growth of A. faecalis in chemostat culture at different C/N ratios.

Shown are steady-state concentrations of NH2OH (Left) and NO2− production (Middle) and protein yield (Right) at C/N ratios of 4 (red), 8 (blue), and 20 (green). Data points and error bars represent the mean and SDs, respectively, of three technical replicates.

Differential gene expression

Gene expression was compared between steady-state reactor cultures at incremental NH4+ concentrations at three different C/N ratios. In total, 332 unique genes were differentially expressed [log2 fold change (LFC) ≥ 1.5, false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05; table S1]. A total of 261 genes were differentially expressed between C/N 8 and 20, 291 genes between C/N 4 and 20, and 9 genes between C/N 4 and 8.

In the nitrifying conditions C/N 8 and 4, most genes of the DNF, POD, and PODh2 clusters were highly up-regulated (Fig. 3), as well as several transaminases, hydroxymethyltransferases, and acetyl-CoA transferases involved in amino acid biosynthesis. In addition, the caa3-type cytochrome c oxidase was up-regulated, but not the bd-type quinol oxidase.

The rank (% of all CDSs) of selected genes is shown for three C/N ratios. Colored bars indicate that a gene is differentially regulated compared to the C/N 20 condition. Red lines are hypothetical reactions discussed in this work. R-NHOH may be represented by glutamic acid monohydroxamate. LFC, log2 fold change.

Markedly, numerous up-regulated genes encoded parts of transport complexes. This included 10 clusters encoding putative ABC transporters for amino acids and dipeptides, 9 individual clusters of high-affinity tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic family-related transporters, 1 high-affinity tricarboxylate transporter of the TTT family, and 1 CstA-like transporter of the putative carbon starvation family. Specific for the C/N 4 condition compared to both C/N 8 and 20 was the up-regulation of the K+-translocating ATPase gene cluster kdpFACBDE, and the down-regulation of an ABC transporter putatively involved in amino acid transport.

Genes for NH4+ uptake (amtB and its regulator glnK), the glutathione salvage protein Ggt, and the putative low-affinity C4-dicarboxylate transporter DctA were down-regulated in both C/N 8 and 4 compared to C/N 20. This further strengthened that conditions C/N 8 and 4 were carbon-limited, while the C/N 20 condition was limited in nitrogen.

Last, a cluster of seven poorly characterized genes (AFN_v2_0075-AFN_v2_0081) was up-regulated at C/N 8 and 4. This cluster encodes a putative oxidoreductase, acyl-CoA ligase, and thiolase that share similarities to proteins involved in carnithine and benzoate metabolism. In addition, one of these gene products contains a rubredoxin-like zinc ribbon domain (DUF35_N).

DISCUSSION

Heterotrophic nitrification is generally reported to occur under a wide range of C/N ratios. For example, one study found that A. faecalis nitrifies in batch cultures growing on citrate or acetate at C/N ratios 28, 14, and 7, which was confirmed at C/N 20, 10, and 5 (54, 55). In agreement with these results, we found that A. faecalis nitrifies when grown in batch on succinate and NH4+ at C/N 20, 8, and 4 and when grown in a chemostat culture at C/N 8 and 4. Strikingly, nitrification was not observed when A. faecalis was grown in chemostat cultures at C/N 20. Under this condition, the supplied NH4+ was not measurable in the supernatant and was most likely limiting the growth of A. faecalis, as also reflected by the lower protein yield. The C/N 20 condition also showed the highest transcription of the AmtB-type high-affinity NH4+ transporter. In contrast, conditions C/N 8 and 4 showed down-regulation of AmtB and up-regulation of aminotransferases and other proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis. Moreover, the observed up-regulation of K+ uptake is in line with a regulatory response to nitrogen sufficiency (56).

In contrast, batch incubations with NH4+ only reach an N-limited state after all NH4+ is consumed. This is reflected by the decrease in N2O and N2 production (fig. S2) and a net decrease in NH2OH concentration (fig. S3) after respiration stops. At C/N 8 and 4, N2O and N2 production were coupled to respiration. At C/N 20, the rate of N2O and N2 production decreased before respiration stopped, which is arguably caused by a limitation in NH4+. Therefore, it can be assumed that A. faecalis produces NH2OH in a state of nitrogen excess. However, this is not the case for NO2− production, which continues probably due to the remaining NH2OH.

The inorganic nitrogen metabolism of A. faecalis has been heavily debated. Classically, A. faecalis is thought to perform HNAD (33). However, Otte and coworkers (44) reported that denitrification could not explain N2O and N2 formation when A. faecalis was nitrifying NH2OH. In agreement with these findings, we could not identify denitrification as a source of N2O and N2. Our 15N-labeling experiments unequivocally showed that NO2− was not converted to N2O and N2 by A. faecalis under nitrifying conditions. These results are further corroborated by knockout studies performed in A. faecalis, where cells with inactivated nirK or nosZ were still capable of N2 production during nitrification (29).

One unanticipated finding in our study was the production of 45N2O by A. faecalis in incubations with NH4+ and NO2− when one of these compounds was 15N-labeled (Fig. 1B). While this accumulation of 45N2O further confirmed the absence of NosZ activity, which would have resulted in 29N2 formation, the origin of the 45N2O in these incubations remains unclear. We argue that its formation could be explained by a chemical reaction between NH2OH and NO (Fig. 3) and demonstrate that NH2OH and NO react rapidly to form N2O under the experimental conditions, even if it should be noted that the concentrations used in this abiotic assay far exceed their expected fluxes encountered in nature (fig. S4). Furthermore, NO production by A. faecalis during nitrification has been reported on multiple occasions (19, 57) and was observed in our batch incubations (fig. S1). How A. faecalis forms NO under these conditions is uncertain. The nirK gene was among the lowest 25% expressed genes during nitrification, and its expression did not change significantly upon exposure to NO2−. Still, low-level constitutive activity of NirK could explain NO production. Alternatively, NO formation from NO2− has also been observed by “nondedicated” NO2− reductases, such as certain molybdoenzymes (58).

The accumulation of NH2OH is indicative of an imbalance between its production and consumption. Our results seem to agree with previous work of Castignetti and coworkers (21), who found that A. faecalis did not appreciably metabolize NH2OH to NO2−. Instead, they found that A. faecalis could produce NO2− from pyruvic oxime, which was thought to be an intermediate in nitrification at the time. Pyruvic oxime forms in a spontaneous reaction between NH2OH and pyruvic acid. However, it should be noted that the occurrence of pyruvic oxime in A. faecalis cultures has not been studied.

Nevertheless, the increase in POD transcription in nitrifying A. faecalis (Fig. 3) substantiates that pyruvic oxime is present and could be the source of NO2− production. Xu and coworkers (29) recently reported that knockout mutants of A. faecalis POD were still able to produce NO2−, which likely can be explained by the presence of several homologs of POD. Consistently, Tsujino and coworkers (59) showed that one of these homologs (designated PODh2 in our study) was also capable of pyruvic oxime oxidation, albeit at 5.5% of the rate of POD. This homolog was also significantly up-regulated during NH2OH production in our study.

It is commonly suggested that heterotrophic nitrification happens through the concerted action of AMO- and HAO-like proteins, analogous to autotrophic ammonia oxidation (30, 60). Furthermore, AMO- and HAO-like proteins have been isolated from heterotrophic nitrifiers in a few instances (20, 23–26). However, except for the refuted AMO-like AbrB-family protein in P. putida, no sequences are available. In this investigation, we also were unable to find evidence for AMO- and HAO-like proteins in the genome of A. faecalis based on sequence homology. Instead, it was recently proposed that the genus Alcaligenes is capable of direct NH4+ oxidation via NH2OH to N2 (46). Consistent with these findings, we found that nitrogen from 15NH2OH ends up in 46N2O and 30N2. Furthermore, when 15NH2OH was present in addition to 14NH4+, 45N2O and 29N2 were formed, supporting the notion that NH4+ is first converted to NH2OH before N2O and N2 are produced. However, we were unable to demonstrate that N2O and N2 formation were biotic processes. In our experiments, the production of NH2OH from NH4+ unequivocally required the activity of A. faecalis. However, despite the up-regulation of the dnf genes, NH2OH accumulated in the medium, and the oxidation rate of NH2OH was similar between active cells and control incubations (Fig. 1 and fig. S3), strongly suggesting the notion that N2O and N2 formation were abiotic. The disappearance of NH2OH appeared to be a first-order reaction, being proportional to the NH2OH concentration. These kinetics have been observed before but were ascribed to enzymatic activity (44).

Our findings renew the debate on the nature of NH2OH oxidation by A. faecalis, which may be explained by the reactivity of NH2OH. Here, we find abiotic transformation of NH2OH to N2O and N2 and of NH2OH with NO to N2O, which is in agreement with previous reports (61, 62). These abiotic conversions are especially stimulated by trace metals and O2 (62, 63). Consistent with this, we found that the abiotic conversion of NH2OH to N2 proceeded faster in MM than in ddH2O, and N2O formation was completely absent in ddH2O. This strongly indicates that the production of N2O from NH2OH relies on the presence of metals such as Cu and Fe, while N2 production is only stimulated by this.

Heterotrophic nitrification has been speculated to function in maintaining the metabolic redox balance. The “bottleneck” theory proposed that HNAD serves as an electron sink for faster NADH turnover during rapid growth (32). Wu and colleagues (45) reason a similar function for DnfA, which is hypothesized to use NADH as an electron donor via DnfB (47). The idea of nitrification as a redox balancing mechanism is tempting but would rely on the saturation of the NADH pool. Yet, heterotrophic nitrification seems to be favored in conditions where carbon appears limiting in comparison to the nitrogen pool. Moreover, while heterotrophic nitrification is tightly linked to respiration, it ultimately depends on a surplus of nitrogen, as shown in our chemostat experiments. Instead, we argue that NH2OH production has a role in the secondary metabolite metabolism of A. faecalis.

The dnf gene cluster encodes several proteins annotated as amino- and hydroxymethyltransferases that were all up-regulated in NH4+ excess conditions, suggestive of a biosynthetic pathway. This is in line with the results obtained by Xu and colleagues (29), who were unable to demonstrate that DnfA binds NH4+. It rather indicates that DnfA does not directly oxidize NH4+ (or NH3) but rather an amino group bound to an organic carrier molecule. Several classes of bioactive metabolites have been shown to contain NH2OH moieties. Hydroxamic acids, for example, are widely found as functional groups of bacterial antibiotics (64) and siderophores (65). A. faecalis has also been reported to produce hydroxamate-containing siderophores (66). However, the biosynthesis of siderophores seems unlikely in our experiments, considering that A. faecalis was cultured with an excess of iron. Furthermore, the production of hydroxamates does not explain the free NH2OH measured in the culture supernatant. Here, it is interesting to consider reports on a nitrifying Arthrobacter sp. that was found to secrete both free NH2OH and hydroxamic acid simultaneously (67). While NH2OH production was mainly correlated to the nitrogen concentration, hydroxamic acid was the main product in iron-deficient media. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of iron deficiency on NH2OH production in A. faecalis has not been assessed. On the other hand, recombinant Escherichia coli expressing DnfAB was capable of NH2OH production (45). DnfA contains a protein families database domain of the AurF family (PF11583), which was found to sequentially oxidize the amino group of aminobenzoic acid to nitrobenzoic acid, via a hydroxylamino intermediate (68). Moreover, the biosynthesis of trichostatin A in Streptomyces sp. RM72 involves an AurF homolog that converts the amido group of glutamine into hydroxylamine, yielding glutamic acid monohydroxamate (69). Thus, assuming a similar reaction mechanism in DnfA and a common precursor such as glutamine, it becomes apparent why recombinant E. coli is capable of NH2OH production with just DnfAB (45). These results point toward a precursor that is common to both A. faecalis and E. coli and is an amide-containing metabolite of a central metabolic pathway, such as certain amino acids. It has recently been reported that in vitro preparations of DnfAB are capable of hydroxylating the amide group of glutamine to form glutamic acid monohydroxamate, as is the case for TsnB7 (48). However, this still does not explain the release of hydroxamate moieties as free NH2OH.

The release of free NH2OH could be catalyzed by DnfC. Deletion of dnfC in A. faecalis JQ135 practically eliminated its ability to produce NH2OH (29). In addition, recombinant E. coli produced substantially more NH2OH with dnfABC than with dnfAB alone (45). The dnfC gene product is annotated as a putative glutamine amidotransferase and contains the type 1 GATase domain (PF00117). Amidotransferases catalyze the hydrolysis of an amido group to free and transfer NH3 to a receiving molecule. Under normal circumstances, this transfer is tightly regulated by binding of the receiving ligand, which prevents NH3 from leaking out (70). Nonetheless, the introduction of mutations can perturb this regulation and increase the leakage of free NH3 (70, 71). Recently, tsnB9 of Streptomyces sp. RM72 was found to be mistakenly annotated as an amidotransferase and rather function as hydroxyamidotransferase (69, 72). Similar to amidotransferases, TsnB9 hydrolyzes the hydroxamate moiety of glutamic acid monohydroxamate to free NH2OH, transferring it to another carrier. Unfortunately, the authors did not report if free NH2OH was measurable. Nonetheless, it is probable that DnfC works in a similar fashion to TsnB9 and liberates NH2OH from an organic carrier. This activity has recently been reported for in vitro preparations of DnfC from A. faecalis, which were capable of hydrolyzing both the amide bond of glutamine and the hydroxamate group of glutamic acid monohydroxamate (Fig. 3) (48). To the best of our knowledge, this would be the second reported instance of a hydroxyamidotransferase and could have important implications for the phylogenetic diversity in which this activity is found.

The question remains why energy is invested in the production of NH2OH if there is no apparent growth benefit. Speculatively, but with several reports supporting this notion, the physiological benefit may be related to the cytotoxic effects of NH2OH. The inhibitory properties of NH2OH produced by heterotrophic nitrifiers were first observed in Arthrobacter sp. (73). Later, NH2OH production by A. faecalis was also shown to have antifungal (74, 75) and antibacterial (76, 77) effects. NH2OH secretion could, therefore, be a competitive strategy. A. faecalis grown in defined cocultures had a competitive advantage over its concomitant organisms, which the authors ascribed to the production of NH2OH (77). Furthermore, A. faecalis has been suggested as a possible plant growth-promoting bacterium. This has been the case in Citrus sinensis, where inoculation with A. faecalis reduced the virulence of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (50). In another case, cabbage seedlings inoculated with A. faecalis were less susceptible to clubroot, a disease caused by the fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae (78).

In conclusion, we show that NH2OH is the main product of heterotrophic nitrification by A. faecalis. We demonstrated that N2O and N2 production are mainly explained by abiotic processes. No clear indications were found for either denitrification or direct NH4+ oxidation to N2, although small amounts of NO2− reduction apparently contributed to N2O production. Given the body of research attempting to apply heterotrophic nitrification to wastewater treatment systems [reviewed in (79)], this lack of HNAD and biotic NH2OH oxidation under nitrifying conditions is annihilating this process idea. If our findings can be generalized to other heterotrophic nitrifiers, then the copious production of NH2OH and N2O would make it unsuitable for use in sustainable wastewater treatment. Therefore, careful examination of abiotic NH2OH conversion mechanisms should be considered when characterizing newly isolated heterotrophic nitrifiers or testing their applicability to wastewater treatment (80).

Together, our data indicate that heterotrophic nitrification in A. faecalis is in fact restricted to the production of NH2OH, with ensuing NO2− production because of spontaneous formation and subsequent oxidation of pyruvic oxime and abiotic reactions that form N2O and N2. Further investigation is required to uncover the exact mechanism of NH2OH production and if an organic precursor is involved. Possibly, the production of free NH2OH could be a competitive strategy for heterotrophic bacteria.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cultivation and medium

A. faecalis ATCC 8750 was obtained from the ATCC and maintained in Difco Nutrient Broth (NB; BD Diagnostics) at 30°C and shaking at 200 rpm or on 1.5% agar plates at 37°C. Nitrification experiments were performed in MM containing per liter dH2O:0.5 g of NH4Cl, 0.2 g of KH2PO4, 0.04 g of MgSO4 × 7 H2O, and 0.2 mg of CaCl2 × 2 H2O. MM was amended with Fe-NTA solution (1 ml liter−1) and trace element solution (1 ml liter−1), as described by Sakoula et al. (81).

Genome analysis

The genomic DNA of A. faecalis ATCC 8750 was isolated from NB-grown cultures using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina short-read libraries were prepared and sequenced by Macrogen Europe using the TruSeq DNA PCR Free Kit (Illumina). The raw sequencing data were quality-checked using FastQC v0.11.5 (82) and trimmed using Flexbar v2.7 (83). Long-read libraries for Oxford Nanopore sequencing were prepared with the Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and sequenced with a FLO-MIN106 flow cell on the MinION device. Base calling was performed using Guppy v6.1.5 in flip-flop mode. Adapters were removed using Porechop v0.2.3 (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop). Hybrid genome assembly was done by Unicycler v.0.4.4. (84) with default settings. Genome quality was checked using CheckM2 (85). Gene calling and annotation were done using a combination of the MicroScope platform (86), DRAM (87), and TransportDB v2.0 (88). Manual curation of the annotation for genes involved in the assimilation and metabolism of inorganic nitrogen was done by searching for homologous genes (≥35% shared identity) in the SwissProt database and comparing gene synteny with published gene clusters.

Influence of C/N ratio in batch

A. faecalis was grown overnight in MM medium containing 20 mM Na2-succinate, 10 mM NH4Cl, and 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.2) at 30°C with shaking at 150 rpm. This preculture was used to inoculate (to an OD600 of 0.002) 120-ml serum vials containing 20 ml of MM containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 mM Na2-succinate and 10 mM (C/N 4), 5 mM (C/N 8), or 2 mM (C/N 20) NH4Cl, with or without addition of 1 and 3 mM NH2OH-HCl. The serum vials were crimp-sealed with thin gray bromobutyl rubber stoppers. Automated high-resolution gas profiles were obtained as described previously (89, 90) at 30°C and 700 rpm stirring.

Origin and fate of NH2OH

A. faecalis was grown on NB and transferred to grow overnight on MM, centrifuged 30 min at 1500g, resuspended in sterile MM, and inoculated at an OD600 of 0.2. Incubations with 15N isotopes were performed in 120-ml serum vials containing 20 ml of MM, 5 mM Na2-succinate, and 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.2) and were crimp-sealed with thick red bromobutyl rubber stoppers. Incubations were supplemented with combinations of 2.5 mM NH4Cl, 0.5 mM NaNO2, and, after 1.5 hours, 0.25 mM NH2OH-HCl. 15N variants of these substrates were added as 15NH4Cl (99%), Na15NO2 (98%), and 15NH2OH-HCl (98%; Cambridge Isotope Labs) in the same concentrations. Control incubations were performed using replicates with sterile MM or by the addition of heat-sterilized biomass instead of active cells.

Abiotic reactions between NH2OH and NO were tested in duplicate in 20 ml of sterile MM or ddH2O amended with 5 mM Na2-succinate, 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 2.5 mM 14NH4Cl, 0.06% (v/v) headspace NO, and with or without the addition of 0.25 mM 15NH2OH.

Chemostat experiments

Cells were grown in a 1 liter of chemostat stirred at 800 rpm at pH 7.2, receiving 2.6 liter of MM day−1 and 0.16 liter of substrate solution day−1. The substrate solution consisted of 250 mM Na2-succinate and 250 mM (C/N 4), 125 mM (C/N 8), or 50 mM (C/N 20) NH4Cl. Oxygen supply was controlled at 20% O2 saturation. At each C/N ratio, triplicate samples were taken for RNA isolation; C, H, N, and O determination; protein determination; and colorimetric assays of NH4+, NH2OH, NO2−, and NO3−. Samples for RNA isolation were pelleted 5 min at 20,000g at 4°C. Immediately, the pellet was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C.

Analytical techniques

NO3−, NO2−, and NH4+ were measured photometrically according to Garcia-Robledo et al. (91) and Taylor et al. (92), respectively. NH2OH was measured according to Frear and Burell (93). Isotopes of N2, N2O, NO, CO2, and O2 were measured by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry using an Agilent 6890A/5975C and Agilent 8890A/5977B, both equipped with an Agilent 6 FT Porapak Q 80/10, by injecting 50 μl of gas directly from the headspace at each time point. CHNO content was determined using a vario MICRO cube (Elementar). The protein content was determined using the bicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific Chemicals).

Transcriptome analysis

RNA was isolated using the RiboPure-Bacteria Kit (Life Technologies Corporation). All centrifugation steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions at 18,000g at 4°C, except for the final elution step and deoxyribonuclease treatment, which were performed at room temperature. Ribosomal RNA depletion and library construction were performed by Macrogen Europe using the Bacterial rRNA Depletion Kit (New England Biolabs) and TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Kit (Illumina), respectively. The raw Illumina data were treated as described above.

Trimmed reads were mapped against the assembled genome using Kallisto v0.46.2 (94). The alignment data from Kallisto were imported into R using tximport, and the differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 workflow (95). Genes were considered differentially expressed between two conditions when their log2 fold change was ≥1.5 and FDR ≤ 0.05.
