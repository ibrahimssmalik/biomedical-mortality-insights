Background

John Dory, Zeus faber Linnaeus, 1758, also known as St Peter’s fish, is a solitary, demersal marine fish characterised by a laterally compressed body of golden-brown colouration with a black spot on either side and long dorsal spines ( Wheeler, 1978). It is widely distributed in the eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and along the entire West African coast, typically occupying depths of 0–200 m ( Iwamoto, 2015; Maravelias et al., 2007). Recently, it has been recorded for the first time in the Black Sea ( Aydın & Karadurmuş, 2023). John Dory has a large, highly protrusible mouth allowing it to predate on relatively large fish which they target using well-developed eyes ( Kim et al., 2020; Stergiou & Fourtouni, 1991).

In the eastern Mediterranean, John Dory begins its life feeding on small zooplankton, such as mysids, until it reaches a total length (TL) of approximately 80 mm ( Stergiou & Fourtouni, 1991). It gradually switches to small benthopelagic fishes then, as it grows, it predates on larger schooling pelagic teleosts ( Kim et al., 2020; Stergiou & Fourtouni, 1991). In Korean coastal waters there is also varying diet composition with size and age ( Kim et al., 2020). Off the Portuguese coast however, there is no prey switching from juvenile to adult life stages ( Silva, 1999). Predominantly, evidence suggests it is an opportunistic feeder, switching prey depending on food availability and abundance which can vary seasonally and with life stage ( Kim et al., 2020). Recently, meso- and microplastics have been found to occur in the gastrointestinal tracts of Z. faber in the Mediterranean ( Bottari et al., 2019).

Z. faber is known to make ‘croaking’ or ‘barking’ noises upon capture onboard ( Radford et al., 2018). These vocalisations have since been documented in-situ in Australia and were found to induce an escape response in conspecifics and heterospecifics such as the Australian Snapper ( Pagurus auratus), suggesting they make sounds as a territorial display against competitors ( Radford et al., 2018).

John Dory is a commercially important species valued for human consumption, meal, and fish oil, as well as being important as a gamefish and in the aquarium trade ( Iwamoto, 2015). It has been a prominent species in mixed species trawl fisheries in the British Isles and is a notable by-catch species for trawl gears globally ( Dunn, 2001; Iwamoto, 2015). Despite being a highly regarded food fish, the only stock assessment for the British Isles, to our knowledge, was carried out between April 1994 and March 1996 ( Dunn, 2001). Dunn describes landings from commercial fisheries in England and Wales alongside biological samples and catch data from the English Channel. John Dory was most abundant in the south and southwest of the British Isles ( Dunn, 2001; Wheeler, 1969). Evidence suggests that the English Channel is a seasonal nursery ground for Z. faber: seasonal peaks in landings coincided with the period of recruitment, in this case during quarters three and four, when individuals were just over 1 year old at the transition between juvenile and adult life stages species ( Dunn, 2001). Recruitment total length of the species was approximately 23 cm TL. Most commercial landings were in the range 23–29 cm TL with a maximum observed TL of 59 cm. Mean TL of first maturity was approximately 26 cm for males and 34.5 cm for females. The global conservation status of this species was last assessed in 2013, deemed ‘Data Deficient’ on the IUCN Red List ( Iwamoto, 2015), which reflects the lack of historical data and biological information for this species ( Dunn, 2001). Because of this, stock status and fishing pressure is uncertain for Z. faber.

In the Northeast Atlantic (FAO area 27), consuming John Dory may prove harmful to human health, as mercury levels of 0.68 ± 0.07 μg g −1 exceed the maximum limit deemed safe for human consumption (0.5 μg g −1) ( Vieira et al., 2021). John Dory imported from Senegal and sold in Turkish fish markets, as well as individuals caught around Turkey, have also been found to carry larvae of the nematode Anisakis pegreffii, with potential implications for human health if consumed ( Pekmezci, 2019; Yardimci et al., 2014).

Molecular investigation of this species has shown significant genetic differentiation (7.44%) between clades in the North Atlantic/Mediterranean region and Australasia, indicating the possibility that they have speciated ( Ward et al., 2008). The first genome of Z. faber was generated in 2016 for a study that suggests immune-related genes play an important role in teleost evolution and speciation ( Malmstrøm et al., 2016). Here we present the second published genome of John Dory, collected and sequenced as part of the Darwin Tree of Life project ( Blaxter et al., 2022). This dataset will be important for furthering our understanding of teleost pathology, immunology, evolution and phylogenetics ( Malmstrøm et al., 2016; Ward et al., 2008).

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from an individual Zeus faber ( Figure 1) collected from Bigbury Bay, UK (50.27, –3.97). A total of 43-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 9 missing joins or mis-joins, reducing the scaffold number by 1.04%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Zeus faber (fZeuFab8) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 804.7 Mb in 190 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 34.5 Mb ( Table 1). The snail plot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of assembly scaffolds on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (97.08%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 22 chromosomal-level scaffolds. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

A Zeus faber specimen (specimen ID MBA-211116-004A, ToLID fZeuFab8) was collected from Bigbury Bay, UK (latitude 50.27, longitude –3.97) on 2021-11-16 using an otter trawl deployed from the RV Sepia. The collectors were Patrick Adkins, Joanna Harley, Rachel Brittain, Kesella Scott-Somme (all Marine Biological Association) and identified by Rachel Brittain, and then preserved in liquid nitrogen. The fish died as part of a trawl attached to another project and was opportunistically taken and dissected by the DToL team who were also on board the Sepia that day.

The workflow for high molecular weight (HMW) DNA extraction at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI) includes a sequence of core procedures: sample preparation; sample homogenisation, DNA extraction, fragmentation, and clean-up. In sample preparation, the fZeuFab8 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice ( Jay et al., 2023). Tissue was homogenised using a PowerMasher II tissue disruptor ( Denton et al., 2023a). HMW DNA was extracted in the WSI Scientific Operations core using the Automated MagAttract v2 protocol ( Oatley et al., 2023). The DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 31 ( Bates et al., 2023). Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation ( Strickland et al., 2023): in brief, the method employs a 1.8X ratio of AMPure PB beads to sample to eliminate shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

RNA was extracted from tissue of fZeuFab8 in the Tree of Life Laboratory at the WSI using the RNA Extraction: Automated MagMax™ mirVana protocol ( do Amaral et al., 2023). The RNA concentration was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and a Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit RNA Broad-Range Assay kit. Analysis of the integrity of the RNA was done using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit and Eukaryotic Total RNA assay.

Protocols developed by the WSI Tree of Life laboratory are publicly available on protocols.io ( Denton et al., 2023b).

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Poly(A) RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the NEB Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit. DNA and RNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (RNA-Seq) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from tissue of fZeuFab8 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and PretextView ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

Title:

The chosen title “The genome sequence of the John Dory, Zeus faber Linnaeus, 1758” lacks clarity and intention. You need to choose a better tile to define why you have done this study and what the genome sequestration is going to do!

Background:

In the background section, this paragraph below is disjointed and very hard to follow:

“John Dory is a commercially important species valued for human consumption, meal, and fish oil, as well as being important as a gamefish and in the aquarium trade (Iwamoto, 2015). It has been a prominent species in mixed species trawl fisheries in the British Isles and is a notable by-catch species for trawl gears globally (Dunn, 2001; Iwamoto, 2015). Despite being a highly regarded food fish, the only stock assessment for the British Isles, to our knowledge, was carried out between April 1994 and March 1996 (Dunn, 2001). Dunn describes landings from commercial fisheries in England and Wales alongside biological samples and catch data from the English Channel. John Dory was most abundant in the south and southwest of the British Isles (Dunn, 2001; Wheeler, 1969). Evidence suggests that the English Channel is a seasonal nursery ground for Z. faber: seasonal peaks in landings coincided with the period of recruitment, in this case during quarters three and four, when individuals were just over 1 year old at the transition between juvenile and adult life stages species (Dunn, 2001). Recruitment total length of the species was approximately 23 cm TL. Most commercial landings were in the range 23–29 cm TL with a maximum observed TL of 59 cm. Mean TL of first maturity was approximately 26 cm for males and 34.5 cm for females. The global conservation status of this species was last assessed in 2013, deemed ‘Data Deficient’ on the IUCN Red List (Iwamoto, 2015), which reflects the lack of historical data and biological information for this species (Dunn, 2001). Because of this, stock status and fishing pressure is uncertain for Z. faber”.

This paragraph provides valuable information for reader but it significantly lacks clarity and confinement. For instance, human health issues with over the threshold elements in the flesh is one argument, data deficient stock assessment is another argument. Similarly, the genetically distinguished populations in different parts of the world that is discussed in the following paragraph, is another statement: “Molecular investigation of this species has shown significant genetic differentiation (7.44%) between clades in the North Atlantic/Mediterranean region and Australasia, indicating the possibility that they have speciated (Ward et al., 2008). The first genome of Z. faber was generated in 2016 for a study that suggests immune-related genes play an important role in teleost evolution and speciation (Malmstrøm et al., 2016). Here we present the second published genome of John Dory, collected and sequenced as part of the Darwin Tree of Life project (Blaxter et al., 2022). This dataset will be important for furthering our understanding of teleost pathology, immunology, evolution and phylogenetics (Malmstrøm et al., 2016; Ward et al., 2008)” – this confuse the reader as to why this study is important and why you made efforts to sequence genomes for John Dory.

Background section, requires substantial revision in term of clarity and confinement and more importantly the message the author want to communicate with the reader as to why they have done this study and what gaps this is going to fill and how it serves the intention of the study. It needs to be specifically clarified as to whether this is for seafood industry and human health matter, or conservation matter? Or even management of the stock? What is the main intention here. without this valuable bit, it is not recommended to jump into the methodology and analysis.

Summary:

Despite my encouragement for scientists to publish their work, I must admit that this particular research lacks clarity and conciseness. Therefore, I have no choice but to recommend rejection and suggest resubmission after thorough revisions, including expanding the research and writing in a more concise manner.

Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?

No

Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?

No

Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?

No

Are the protocols appropriate and is the work technically sound?

Partly

Reviewer Expertise:

Fisheries sciences, Biological Sciences, Climate Change, Fish Stock Assessment, influences of environmental and anthropogenic impacts on marine resources

I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above.

This manuscript presents the genome sequence of a fish species (John Dory) that is in general poorly studied and for which conservation strategies can not be appropriately defined. Considering that understanding the genetic connectivity is critical for defining management units, and that full genomes facilitate the analysis and interpretation of population genomic data, this study is considered important for improving the conservation of the John Dory. The methods are well described and the results are pertinent. I have only one comment that I think the authors can address easily:

- In the introduction they should better explain what is the knowledge of this species in terms of how many populations exist and potential subspecies. The data of  "significant genetic differentiation (7.44%) between clades in the North Atlantic/Mediterranean region and Australasia" seem to be taken from the abstract of a cited paper, but there is not much information here to understand what is the main issue that could be resolved with the help of a full genome sequence.

Adkins and colleagues have submitted a manuscript describing the genomic assembly of a John Dory fish ( Zeus faber). The sequencing was performed using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C data and the assembly using hifiasm and manual curation. The resulting assembly exceeds general benchmarks for high-quality assemblies including scoring for BUSCO, k-mer completeness, and percentage of sequence mapped to chromosomes. All raw and analyzed datasets are deposited in publicly available repositories. The data are clear, the approaches adequately documented. I have no substantial objections to any of the data presented. It should be a very useful assembly for researchers who are interested in John Dory biology.
