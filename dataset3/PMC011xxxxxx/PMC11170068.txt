Background

The Notch-wing Button Acleris emargana (Fabricius, 1775) is a moth in the Tortricidae family. The species’ vernacular name is a reference to the remarkable shape of the forewings, which show a large inward ‘notch’ along their leading edge. As in other members of its genus, the species is polymorphic ( Bradley et al., 1973). Acleris emargana has a Palearctic distribution, being found across northern Eurasia east to at least northern China and Altai and Buryatia in Russia ( Karsholt et al., 2005). The species’ distribution at the eastern boundary of its range is poorly known due to confusion with its recently split sister taxon Acleris effractana, which has a Holarctic distribution ( Karsholt et al., 2005). Acleris emargana is widespread across the British Isles except in the Outer Hebrides where it appears to be replaced by effractana ( Elliott et al., 2018).

The species overwinters as an egg, with the larva feeding between May and July on Salix or Populus, and less commonly, Betula, Corylus or Alnus ( Bradley et al., 1973; Elliott et al., 2018). The larva feeds from within a folded leaf or between spun leaves ( Bradley et al., 1973; Elliott et al., 2018). Pupation occurs in the larval habitation or amongst moss. Adults occur between July and September, often found in damp areas where sallow ( Salix ssp.) is established ( Bradley et al., 1973; Elliott et al., 2018).

The genome of Acleris emargana was sequenced as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project, a collaborative effort to sequence all named eukaryotic species in the Atlantic Archipelago of Britain and Ireland. Here we present a complete, chromosome-level genome sequence for Acleris emargana, based on one male specimen from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one male Acleris emargana ( Figure 1) collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire (51.77, –1.34). A total of 25-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads and 67-fold coverage in 10X Genomics read clouds was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 27 missing joins or mis-joins and removed three haplotypic duplications, reducing the assembly length by 0.99% and the scaffold number by 10.53%, and decreasing the scaffold N50 by 1.34%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Acleris emargana (ilAclEmar1) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 691.4 Mb in 33 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 22.8 Mb ( Table 1). Most (99.98%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 30 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 29 autosomes and the Z sex chromosome. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 2– Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Genome annotation report

The Acleris emargana genome assembly (GCA_927399475.2) was annotated using the Ensembl rapid annotation pipeline ( Table 1; https://rapid.ensembl.org/Acleris_emargana_GCA_927399445.1/Info/Index). The resulting annotation includes 22,022 transcribed mRNAs from 21,886 protein-coding genes.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

The specimen used for DNA sequencing was a male Acleris emargana (specimen ID Ox000806, individual ilAclEmar1), collected from Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire (biological vice-county Berkshire), UK (latitude 51.77, longitude –1.34) on 2020-08-01 using a light trap. The specimen used for Hi-C sequencing (specimen ID Ox000951, individual ilAclEmar2) was collected from the same location on 2020-09-08. Both specimens were collected and identified by Douglas Boyes (University of Oxford) and preserved on dry ice.

DNA was extracted at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The ilAclEmar1 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice with tissue set aside for Hi-C sequencing. Tissue from the whole organism was disrupted using a Nippi Powermasher fitted with a BioMasher pestle. High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted using the Qiagen MagAttract HMW DNA extraction kit. HMW DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30. Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation using AMPure PB beads with a 1.8X ratio of beads to sample to remove the shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA sample. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus and 10X Genomics read cloud DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (10X) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from whole organism tissue of ilAclEmar2 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). One round of polishing was performed by aligning 10X Genomics read data to the assembly with Long Ranger ALIGN, calling variants with FreeBayes ( Garrison & Marth, 2012). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

The paper presents an outstanding genomic dataset of Acleris emargana, with detailed elaboration on the species' background and a comprehensive summary of the generated genome. Overall, this is an excellent genomic dataset, but there are a few minor comments:

Q1. The authors mentioned in the research background that Acleris emargana is often confused with Acleris effractana. In this case, it is suggested to provide criteria for identification. Evidence should be given from either morphological or genetic levels to confirm that the sequenced species is indeed Acleris emargana.

Q2. The sequencing methods section should detail the sequencing strategy.

Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?

Yes

Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?

Yes

Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?

Yes

Are the protocols appropriate and is the work technically sound?

Yes

Version 1recommendationapprove-with-reservations
This paper presents a thorough solid technical report on the genome assembly of a tortricid moth from the UK, identified as Acleris emargana. My only question to this report is the way how the sequenced specimen has been identified in terms of taxonomy. This must be explicitly documented in the paper, since it is now well known that the taxon in question belongs to a species complex formed by 2 (if not even 3?) species.

The only reliable way to distinguish emargana from its sister taxon effractana is by anatomy of the genitalia, or by DNA barcoding. Please say clearly which way you have used to identify our focal specimen – since from the time of publication onwards the genomic information will be linked to the respective taxon name ‘forever’. Hence, identification should be 100% error-free.

In this respect, it is noteworthy that the complex around Acleris emargana/effractana comprises 3 clusters in the bold systems database:

BOLD:AAB3524 (Europe; Acleris emargana); BOLD:AAB3525 (North America, Europe; A. effractana); BOLD:AAA6999 (Europe),

with specimens of effractana also being (marginally) further differentiated between North American and European origin (see here, Giligan et al. 2020 (Ref -1): https://doi.org/10.3390/insects11090594).

Because of these circumstances, it may also be noted in the paper that all information (e.g. on host plants) pre-dating the recognition of effractana as a distinct species (pre-2005) is a bit suspect, as long as no voucher specimens exist, whose taxonomic identity has been clarified in retrospect. Therefore, any paragraphs where ecological on Acleris emargana are mentioned in this paper reporting its genome should be restricted to sources in which the taxonomic identity has been rigorously checked.

Otherwise: a valid technical report that makes available important genomic data to the scientific community.

Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?

No

Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?

Yes

Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?

Yes

Are the protocols appropriate and is the work technically sound?

Yes
