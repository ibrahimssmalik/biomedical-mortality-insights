After publication of the article [1], it was brought to our attention that:

Figures 2 and Fig. 3 in the original paper still have revision red lettering on some legends. The all-black lettering figures are shown below:

Figure 2.

Figure 3.

In the Funding section, we neglected to update the year-based numbering of two grants of B. L. Yen which we have updated.

This study … the Central Government S & T (NHRI‐13A1‐CSGP08‐048 to B.L.Yen), and the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI‐13A1‐ CSPP06‐014 to B.L.Yen).

The original publication has been corrected.

B. Linju Yen and Li‑Tzu Wang contributed equally to this work.
