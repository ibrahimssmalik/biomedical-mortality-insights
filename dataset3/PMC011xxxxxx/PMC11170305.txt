This cohort study investigates whether sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use is associated with lupus nephritis and other kidney and cardiac adverse outcomes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and type 2 diabetes.

Key Points

Question

Is use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) associated with onset and progression of lupus nephritis and other kidney and cardiac outcomes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 2 diabetes?

Findings

In this multicenter cohort study of 1775 matched pairs of SGLT2i users and nonusers with SLE and type 2 diabetes, use of SGLT2is was associated with significantly reduced risk of lupus nephritis, dialysis, kidney transplant, heart failure, and all-cause mortality compared with no SGLT2i use.

Meaning

In this study, use of SGLT2is was associated with improved kidney and cardiac outcomes in patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes.

Importance

Lupus nephritis is a major complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Randomized clinical trials have shown nephroprotective and cardioprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is).

Objective

To investigate whether the use of SGLT2is is associated with the onset and progression of lupus nephritis and other kidney and cardiac outcomes in patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter cohort study used the US Collaborative Network of the TriNetX clinical data platform to identify patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2022. Data collection and analysis were conducted in September 2023.

Exposures

Individuals were categorized into 2 groups by SGLT2i use or nonuse with 1:1 propensity score matching.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the 5-year adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) of lupus nephritis, dialysis, kidney transplant, heart failure, and mortality for the 2 groups.

Results

From 31 790 eligible participants, 1775 matched pairs of SGLT2i users and nonusers (N = 3550) were selected based on propensity scores. The mean (SD) age of matched participants was 56.8 (11.6) years, and 3012 (84.8%) were women. SGLT2i users had a significantly lower risk of lupus nephritis (AHR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40-0.77), dialysis (AHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.17-0.48), kidney transplant (AHR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.62), heart failure (AHR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53-0.78), and all-cause mortality (AHR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26-0.47) than SGLT2i nonusers.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes, SGLT2i users had a significantly lower risk of lupus nephritis, dialysis, kidney transplant, heart failure, and all-cause mortality than nonusers. The findings suggest that SGLT2is may provide some nephroprotective and cardioprotective benefits.

pmcIntroduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a relapsing and life-threatening autoimmune disease that occurs when the body’s immune system has lost tolerance to its nuclear antigens.1 Patients with SLE have approximately 2.2-times higher mortality rates than individuals without SLE.2 Lupus nephritis is the most common and severe complication of SLE. Approximately 40% to 60% of patients with SLE have lupus nephritis, and most cases occur within 5 years of SLE diagnosis.3 Despite significant advances in the understanding and treatment of lupus nephritis in recent years, treatment outcomes for lupus nephritis remain unsatisfactory and lupus nephritis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE.3 Approximately 5% to 30% of patients with lupus nephritis may progress to kidney failure within 10 years.4 Patients who have SLE with kidney involvement have a 1.9-times higher mortality rate than those without kidney involvement.5 Moreover, patients with SLE and kidney disease are more likely to develop other organ-related diseases, such as heart disease, and have a lower quality of life.4

While SLE and type 2 diabetes do not commonly occur together, a patient with SLE and type 2 diabetes may have greater risk of poor outcomes because both conditions are associated with kidney and cardiovascular disease.6 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) that lower blood glucose levels by inhibiting approximately 90% of glucose reabsorption in the proximal kidney tubule and increasing glycosuria were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating type 2 diabetes in 2012.7 A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) found that SGLT2is were associated with nephroprotective and cardioprotective effects, possibly mediated by reducing intraglomerular pressure.8 Two studies showed that SGLT2is significantly reduced proteinuria in patients (n = 5 and n = 9) with lupus nephritis.9,10 Zhao et al10 performed a study showing that empagliflozin could restore kidney SGLT2 overexpression, decrease mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity to attenuate inflammation, enhance autophagy, and alleviate podocyte damage in patients with lupus nephritis and in lupus-prone mice. Because patients with SLE and lupus nephritis were excluded from the cardiovascular and kidney RCTs due to their potential need for acute immunosuppression,8 we conducted this cohort study to investigate whether SGLT2i use might be associated with the onset and progression of lupus nephritis and other kidney and cardiac outcomes in patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Study Design and Data Source

This retrospective cohort study used data aggregated from TriNetX, the world’s largest and most extensive clinical data and evidence ecosystem within the life sciences and health care domain. TriNetX encompasses deidentified electronic health records of over 250 million individuals sourced from more than 120 global health care organizations. TriNetX uses a standardized framework to ensure data quality that encompasses 3 primary categories of quality metrics: conformance, completeness, and plausibility.11 TriNetX has been used for executing numerous high-quality studies.12,13 The TriNetX platform adheres to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the General Data Protection Regulation. The Western Institutional Review Board granted TriNetX a waiver of informed consent because it solely aggregates counts and statistical summaries of deidentified information. Furthermore, the use of TriNetX for this study received approval from the institutional review board of Chung Shan Medical University Hospital. The reporting of this study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.

We conducted data collection and analysis in September 2023 using the US Collaborative Network, a subnetwork of the TriNetX platform, for the relevant analyses. This network comprised 59 health care organizations. In line with our study’s objectives, we limited the study period to encompass dates between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2022.

Study Participants

Individuals eligible for this study were those diagnosed with SLE using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code M32 and with comorbid type 2 diabetes using codes E08 to E13, excluding E10. The definitions of SLE and type 2 diabetes are based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes from outpatient or inpatient records. The algorithm of using ICD-10-CM and ICD-10 codes to define these 2 diseases has been validated by previous studies.14,15 We excluded individuals aged younger than 20 years and those who had ever been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as defined by ICD-10-CM code E10.

We subsequently categorized these individuals into 2 groups, distinguishing them by SGLT2i use as determined by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code A10BK. SGLT2i users were identified as individuals who were prescribed an SGLT2i at least once during the study period. For SGLT2i users, the index date was set as the date of the first prescription. SGLT2i nonusers were defined as individuals with no recorded prescription of an SGLT2i in their electronic medical records at any point. For SGLT2i nonusers, the index date was established as the date of initial diagnosis of both SLE and type 2 diabetes. Patients in both cohorts were excluded if they had experienced any of the specified outcomes of interest (lupus nephritis, dialysis, kidney transplant, heart failure, or death) before or on the index date.

Race was ascertained by self-report and included in the analysis for generalizability of the findings. Categories were American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, other (included as a category in TriNetX and not broken down further), and unknown.

Outcomes and Covariates

The adverse outcomes under investigation included lupus nephritis (as defined by ICD-10-CM codes M32.14-M32.15),16 dialysis (ICD-10-CM codes Z49.31, Z49.32, or Z99.2 or Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] code 1012740),17 kidney transplant (indicated by ICD-10-CM codes Z94.0 or CPT code 1008098, 0TY0, or 0TY1), heart failure (ICD-10-CM code I50),18 and all-cause mortality. The present study included the following covariate factors, assessed within 1 year before the index date to mitigate potential confounding effects: demographic variables, lifestyle factors, medical service utilization, diabetes severity, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results.

Statistical Analyses

To mitigate the influence of confounding factors, we used TriNetX’s built-in capability to generate propensity scores and 1:1 matching using greedy nearest neighbor matching. A caliper of 0.1 pooled SDs of the 2 groups was used during matching for variables. We assessed the comparability between the 2 groups before and after matching using standardized mean differences (SMDs). An SMD less than 0.1 indicated that the cohorts were well balanced.

We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of survival free of the respective outcomes. The hazard ratios (HRs), their associated 95% CIs, and the test for proportionality were computed using the survival package in R, version 3.2.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing). The log-rank test results determined whether there were differences in survival curves between the cohorts and were conducted within the TriNetX platform.

We conducted several subgroup analyses to examine differences between groups defined by their initial diabetes management and severity based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and creatinine levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease or related complications. This was done to assess whether the association of SGLT2is with the onset of lupus nephritis varies under different conditions. We also conducted several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. First, we performed a competing risk analysis with mortality as the competing event. Second, we conducted an active comparator analysis to evaluate outcomes between SGLT2i and sulfonylurea users and between SGLT2i and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor users among patients with SLE. Third, we compared outcome risk between patients with at least 2 SGLT2i prescriptions and those without an SGLT2i prescription. Two-sided P < .05 was considered significant.

Results

Characteristics of Study Participants

This study included 31 790 eligible participants initially. Following propensity score matching, 1775 patients were categorized as SGLT2i users, with an equal number in the SGLT2i nonuser group. The selection process is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Flowchart of the Selection Process

SGLT2i indicates sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; T2D, type 2 diabetes.

The study participants’ baseline characteristics both before and after matching are displayed in Table 1. Before the matching process, disparities existed between the 2 groups regarding diabetes severity, comorbidities, medication use, and laboratory data. After matching, these discrepancies were minimal and fell within an acceptable range, with SMDs of less than 0.1 for the matched variables. The mean (SD) age of the 3550 matched participants was 56.8 (11.6) years; 480 (13.5%) were men, 3012 (84.8%) were women, and sex was unknown for 58 (1.6%). Twenty patients (0.6%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 92 (2.6%) were Asian, 905 (25.5%) were Black or African American, 20 (0.6%) were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 1982 (55.8%) were White, 121 (4.4%) were other race and ethnicity, and 413 (11.6%) had unknown race and ethnicity (if there were 10 or fewer participants in matched groups within a category, the count is reported as 10).

Outcomes

Table 2 presents the number of patients with outcomes in both cohorts accompanied by the 5-year adjusted HRs (AHRs) for the incidence of these outcomes in SGLT2i users compared with SGLT2i nonusers. SGLT2i users had a lower risk of lupus nephritis (AHR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40-0.77) (Figure 2A), dialysis (AHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.17-0.48), kidney transplant (AHR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.62), heart failure (AHR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53-0.78) (Figure 2B), and all-cause mortality (AHR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26-0.47) (Figure 2C) than SGLT2i nonusers. Even when accounting for various variables (eTable 1 in Supplement 1) or considering different follow-up durations (eTable 2 in Supplement 1), we consistently observed similar findings. The competing risk analyses using death as a competing risk also showed that SGLT2i use was associated with lower risk of lupus nephritis (AHR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.35-0.54), dialysis (AHR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.26-0.44), kidney transplant (AHR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25-0.45), heart failure (AHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.48-0.68), and all-cause mortality (AHR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26-0.47) compared with no use of SGLT2is (eTable 3 in Supplement 1).

Subgroup Analyses

We further investigated the risk of outcomes by dividing the patient population into subgroups based on diabetes management status as determined by HbA1c levels (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Among patients with HbA1c levels below 7% (to convert percentage of total hemoglobin to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), SGLT2i users had a lower risk of lupus nephritis, heart failure, and all-cause mortality than SGLT2i nonusers. However, for individuals with HbA1c levels above 7%, SGLT2i users with HbA1c levels either exceeding or below 9% had a lower risk of lupus nephritis, dialysis, heart failure, and all-cause mortality than SGLT2i nonusers with those HbA1c levels (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).

Regardless of whether creatinine levels were greater or less than 1.5 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4), SGLT2i users consistently had lower risk of lupus nephritis, dialysis, heart failure, and all-cause mortality than SGLT2i nonusers (eTable 6 in Supplement 1). Among patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, SGLT2i users had lower risk of lupus nephritis, dialysis, heart failure, and all-cause mortality than SGLT2i nonusers (eTable 7 in Supplement 1). For patients with eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater, SGLT2i users had lower risk of lupus nephritis, heart failure, and all-cause mortality than SGLT2i nonusers.

In patients with or without chronic kidney disease and kidney complications, SGLT2i users also had a lower risk of lupus nephritis, dialysis, heart failure, and all-cause mortality than SGLT2i nonusers (eTables 8 and 9 in Supplement 1). Figure 3 shows the results of all subgroup analyses for the risk of incident lupus nephritis.

Sensitivity Analyses

In the matched cohorts, SGLT2i use was associated with a lower risk of lupus nephritis, dialysis, kidney transplant, heart failure, and all-cause mortality compared with use of sulfonylureas (eTable 10 in Supplement 1). Compared with the matched DPP-4 inhibitor users, SGLT2i users had a lower risk of dialysis, kidney transplant, heart failure, and all-cause mortality (eTable 11 in Supplement 1). Patients with at least 2 prescriptions of SGLT2is had a lower risk of lupus nephritis, dialysis, kidney transplant, heart failure, and all-cause mortality than SGLT2i nonusers (eTable 12 in Supplement 1).

Discussion

This cohort study showed that SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of incident lupus nephritis, dialysis, kidney transplant, heart failure, and all-cause mortality compared with SGLT2i nonuse in patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes. This finding was consistent in different variable-adjusted models. Our study suggests that SGLT2is may provide multiple benefits beyond glycemic control, including nephroprotection and cardioprotection in patients with both SLE and type 2 diabetes.

A phase I/II trial found increased glucose metabolism within immune cells of individuals with SLE.19 Taming this overreactive immune response through metabolic modulation has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for SLE.19 In an RCT, metformin demonstrated the capability to decrease the likelihood of lupus flare-ups.20 Results of RCTs have suggested SGLT2i use for the treatment of hyperglycemia and primary prevention of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.21,22,23 SGLT2is may reduce the risk of diabetic kidney disease by increasing glycosuria and improving glomerular hyperfiltration.7 Since the development of lupus nephritis is also associated with increased intraglomerular pressure, SGLT2is may reduce the risk of lupus nephritis in patients with SLE.8 Two pilot studies showed that SGLT2i could significantly reduce proteinuria in patients with SLE and lupus nephritis.9,10 However, these studies had limited participant numbers (5 and 9 patients each). A preclinical study by Zhao and colleagues10 demonstrated that empagliflozin administration could reduce the levels of mouse anti–double stranded (ds) DNA immunoglobulin G (IgG)–specific antibodies, serum creatinine, and protein in urine; ameliorate glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage; increase the expression of synaptopodin and reverse podocyte injury caused by SGLT2 overexpression; alleviate podocyte apoptosis by attenuating inflammation; and increase autophagy by reducing mTORC1 activity in patients with lupus nephritis and lupus-prone mice. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report that SGLT2i use may be associated with decreased onset of lupus nephritis in patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the results remained consistent when analyzed using different models of the variables and over a period of follow-up that ranged from 1 to 5 years.

There are possible explanations for SGLT2i use being associated with a lower risk of incident lupus nephritis. First, SGLT2is can increase natriuresis, which triggers the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism.7 This mechanism results in vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles, which attenuates intraglomerular hypertension, decreases glomerular shear stress, and reduces protein levels in urine. It also reduces tubular workload, oxygen demand, and injury.8 Second, SGLT2is may exert immunomodulatory effects by reducing dsDNA autoantibodies, decreasing immune complex deposition in kidney tissues, and attenuating kidney dysfunction and lupus nephritis development.10 Third, SGLT2is can increase ketone production and block lipopolysaccharide-induced and NLRP3-mediated inflammation. They also affect macrophage polarization through interactions with the mTOR and AMP-activated protein kinase pathways. Thus, they help decrease oxidative stress, reduce proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation, attenuate podocyte damage, and regulate endothelial dysfunction.10,19,24 Fourth, SGLT2is can inhibit apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen species and attenuate glomerular atrophy, kidney fibrosis, and kidney dysfunction.25,26

A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated that SGLT2i use was associated with slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease to kidney failure and kidney replacement therapy in people with or without diabetes.27 A prespecified analysis of the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease Trial showed that dapagliflozin could significantly reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with IgA nephropathy.28 Uncontrolled lupus nephritis may worsen over time and lead to chronic kidney disease.4,29 Moreover, about 25% of patients with diabetes will develop chronic kidney disease.30 In our study, some patients had chronic kidney disease. However, SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of dialysis and kidney transplant compared with no use of SGLT2i in patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the observed protective association remained consistent in patients with HbA1c levels of 7% or higher, creatinine levels less than 1.5 mg/dL, and eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Patients with SLE have an increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease due to vascular inflammation.1,29 Cardiovascular disease is also a major complication and cause of death in patients with diabetes.31 A meta-analysis of RCTs showed that SGLT2i use was associated with preventing the development of heart failure and slowing its progression at various stages, benefiting people with and without diabetes.32 The present study showed that SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart failure compared with SGLT2i nonuse in patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, a consistent protective association was observed across different analytical models, over 1 to 5 years of follow-up, and in patients with HbA1c levels of 7% or higher and normal or abnormal kidney function.

People with SLE have approximately double the mortality rate of those who do not have SLE.2 The numerous complications associated with diabetes also amplify the risk of death.31 The mortality risk is substantially higher for someone diagnosed with both SLE and type 2 diabetes compared with someone who has only 1 of these conditions.6 A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated that SGLT2i use was associated with decreased risk of mortality for patients regardless of whether they had type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease.27 Our study showed that for patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes, SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality compared with non-SGLT2i treatments. The reduced mortality observed in patients with SLE who used SGLT2i may be due to the association of use of this drug class with reduced incidence of lupus nephritis, dialysis, kidney transplant, and heart failure.

Limitations

There are some limitations to this study. First, in attempting to match certain medications, HbA1c, and kidney function, we faced challenges in achieving optimal matching between the SGLT2i and control groups. However, we could successfully match diabetes complications and chronic kidney disease to balance the severity of diabetes and kidney disease between these 2 groups. Furthermore, we performed subgroup analyses based on different levels of HbA1c and kidney function to see if results varied with different levels of kidney function and glycemic control. Second, we obtained these data for patients treated in hospitals with the possibility of missing or incomplete data on patients with mild or asymptomatic SLE or lupus nephritis treated in outpatient clinics, leading to selection bias or misclassification of data. However, this problem could affect both the SGLT2i and the control groups, potentially leading to an unbiased discrepancy between the 2 groups. The electronic medical record system in TriNetX also has some missing information, such as sex and race for some patients. Data on smoking habits were lacking, so we used diagnostic codes as a proxy for this missing information; however, there may be problems with coding completeness. Nevertheless, if a patient’s smoking history was recorded, the specificity should be high. Third, we determined the incidence of lupus nephritis using ICD-10-CM codes without pathologic confirmation by biopsy. However, a previous validation study showed that ICD-10-CM codes can accurately identify the occurrence of lupus nephritis.16 Fourth, certain risk factors may not be encompassed in the collected data; therefore, the propensity score matching method may not completely rectify potential imbalances in patient risk between the SGLT2i and control groups. Additionally, a retrospective cohort study often has unknown or unmeasured confounding factors even after adjusting for many important variables. Thus, the results indicate associations rather than causal relationships.

Conclusions

This cohort study revealed that SGLT2i use in patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes was associated with a significantly reduced risk of lupus nephritis, dialysis, kidney transplant, heart failure, and all-cause mortality compared with SGLT2i nonuse. SGLT2is may provide some nephroprotective and cardioprotective benefits in patients with SLE and type 2 diabetes. However, these findings need to be confirmed by more rigorous, prospective RCTs.
