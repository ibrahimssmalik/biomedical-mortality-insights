Shifting midwifery education to a university level is of great importance for healthcare systems worldwide by preparing graduates for current and future challenges. Some of them referring to management, research and teaching tasks as well as advanced practitioner roles, require competences that can only be acquired in a Master's program. The objectives of this narrative review are to outline the differences and commonalities of organizational aspects of Master’s programs in selected OECD countries and to point out the competence goals and learning outcomes they are based on. Fifteen Master’s programs in twelve OECD countries were identified and analyzed. Considering the organizational characteristics, differences are found in admission requirements and qualification levels, while similarities relate to the awarded title (MSc). All programs aim to develop abilities for research to advance midwifery practice. Leadership and management abilities are addressed through effective teamwork and communication. The programs’ aims are to develop abilities for midwifery education tasks. Whereas competence goals mostly align across the programs, they are addressed differently through various learning outcomes. Development and enhancement of Master’s programs in midwifery are needed by focusing on core elements, such as common competence goals. It is equally important to adapt them to national healthcare and educational systems.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Academization of the healthcare professions is of great importance for healthcare systems worldwide1. Not only should the professions be made more attractive1, but graduates should also be prepared for the increased future challenges of their professions1,2. This development is reflected within in the midwifery profession, as it became more complex in recent decades due to a variety of factors3,4. These include epidemiological trends such as the increasing age of first-time mothers4,5 as well as socio-economic challenges, like the growing number of women with a migration background4,6. Political and economic factors include cost-efficient and nationwide healthcare4,7, whereas for example clinical challenges arise such as higher rate of multiple birth due to fertility treatments4,6. As a result, midwives are faced with increased demands on their working environment and practice4. The huge midwifery shortage worldwide reinforces these developments4,8. To deal with these challenges, there is a need for well-educated and competent midwives3,8. In recent decades, midwifery education shifted to a university level8-10, mostly to ensure autonomy and professionalization of the midwifery profession11,12. Many of the countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) regions allow primary midwifery qualification through a three- or four-year Bachelor’s program9,13. As international standards for midwifery education do not specify the minimum level of qualification14-16, there are different pathways for pre-service education for midwives worldwide [direct entry programs (e.g. Bachelor’s degree), post-nursing programs and integrated programs (nursing and midwifery qualifications combined)9]. Bachelor’s programs for primary qualification are often seen as a suitable way to react to the shortage of midwives as well as to provide appropriate skills and abilities for new starters9,17. But it is known that the minimum level and quality of midwifery education often does not adequately prepare midwives for their professional practice13. There are challenges that cannot be met with a Bachelor’s degree, especially referring to management13,14,18, research19 and teaching20,21 tasks as well as for advanced practitioner roles22.

Midwives with excellent management skills are needed to meet the aforementioned challenges21,23. The International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) recommends the following principles to ensure that midwifery management is effective: inspire, influence, advocate, collaborate, communicate, challenge the status-quo, be accountable, and demonstrate compassion14,18. Through Master’s programs, midwives can further develop the relevant skills recommended by ICM14,18. They educate skills far beyond Bachelor’s level not only in management, but also advanced pedagogical skills to enable midwives to undertake educational tasks20,21. Beyond that, research skills are deepened during Master’s programs19. All these taught areas allow midwives to meet the mentioned challenges by expanding and re-organizing education, personnel planning, ensuring a positive working environment and innovative evidence-based practice21,23, as well as further develop the midwifery profession24.

Status quo of Master’s programs in midwifery

As more countries worldwide develop Bachelor’s programs for midwives8,25,26, it is essential to create opportunities for further academic qualification10. Compared to Bachelor’s programs, considerably fewer Master’s programs in midwifery are implemented8,25 although it is recommended that midwifery education should be offered at Bachelor’s and Master’s level26,27. Internationally, barely a quarter (26%) of the 74 included countries in the State of the World’s Midwifery (SoWMy) report indicate that a Master’s program is the highest qualification, while another quarter (27%) offer a doctorate for midwives8, mostly in high-income countries8. In Europe, all Bachelor’s, Master’s and doctoral programs are described and standardized by the European Qualification Framework (EQF)28,29. To use these levels internationally, the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)30 is used. Both EQF28 and the ISCED30 describe the Master’s degree at level 7. Programs at level 7 aim to enable participants for advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies30. Despite these general standardizations, there are no further standards for Master’s programs in midwifery, as most standards apply for primary qualification of midwives14-16. While some Master’s programs serve as primary qualification through post-nursing programs9, most of the Master’s programs in midwifery are designed as postgraduate qualification after a Bachelor’s degree9. The international lack of standardization or recommendations for Master’s programs in midwifery, leads to the fact that they differ at national, European as well as international level, especially in terms of duration, content and results10,12,23,26. Nevertheless, studies show a trend of acquired competences in Master’s programs. Midwives with a Master’s degree have a higher level of pedagogical, management and research skills21, which is why these areas will be outlined in the following.

Master’s programs in midwifery: Leadership and management

The midwifery profession is traditionally predominantly practiced by women worldwide. To strengthen midwifery and to motivate and retain qualified professionals, the establishment of midwifery leadership opportunities are crucial. Still, challenges remain at both policy and clinical levels13. A lack of female leaders in the healthcare systems, as well as limited leadership opportunities for midwives often results in midwives not climbing the leadership ladder. At the same time, decisions about midwifery profession are often not made by leading midwives themselves. Especially, if midwifery is incorporated into the structures of nursing, midwives have limited leadership opportunities8. According to the SoWMy, 71% of the reporting countries state that at least one midwife holds a leadership position8. Nevertheless, midwives need to be supported when it comes to practicing their role as leaders13. To fulfil this role, learning management skills in midwifery education is necessary31. Studies show that midwives recognize the need for systematic education for high levels of management to enable the next generation of midwifery leaders31. Midwifery leaders are not only crucial in policy and clinics, but also in research and education18.

Master’s programs in midwifery: Research

Profession-specific research is fundamental for midwifery18. Midwives provide their practice based on the best available evidence. The WHO recommends an evidence-based midwifery education13. To enable evidence-based education and practice, a wide range of midwifery research is needed19. For woman-centered research, midwives themselves should be the researcher. Midwives can understand woman’s needs and the impact of research on them. They understand the practical aspects of midwifery and the reality of clinical research19. To become a midwife researcher, there are various options, e.g. Master’s programs in midwifery19. They allow midwives to enter a doctoral program, which further trains them as scientific leaders and promotes their academic careers2. To pursue an academic career at university, the ability to teach as a midwife is equally important20.

Master’s programs in midwifery: Midwifery educator

Midwifery educators educate midwifery students in theory and practice. This should include midwifery educators who teach in educational settings and clinical midwives who teach in practice, or both23. The quality of the educators themselves has a huge impact on the quality of midwifery graduates. It is virtually impossible to train the practitioners, leaders and researchers that are needed if there are not enough well-trained educators in the programs (both Bachelor’s and Master’s programs)20. It is already known that midwifery programs have a shortage of competent midwifery educators20. To be a competent midwifery educator, advanced knowledge, skills and behaviors are needed20. However, there is a disagreement about what qualifications and competencies midwives need to become midwifery educators32. The need for competent midwifery educators is supported by the WHO document ‘WHO Midwifery Educator Core Competencies’20. Four of the eight formulated competence domains are at Master’s level26. Therefore, the completion of Master’s programs in midwifery can raise the quality of midwifery educators worldwide and therefore improve the quality of care of future midwives20. In accordance with the recommendations of the German Council of Science and Humanities, medical faculties can develop their strength here through the combined competencies relevant to the healthcare system33. As many Master’s programs in midwifery meet the main areas of leadership and management, research, and midwifery educator10,21, some programs go beyond these areas by focusing on a further approach: Advanced midwifery practice (AMP)22.

Advanced midwifery practice

AMP can be defined as: ‘A level of midwifery practice at which midwives use their expertise, management and clinical leadership skills to provide evidence-based, tailored care for woman and their families independently and autonomously. Professional leadership and research skills are used to evaluate practice and advance midwifery as a profession and science’22. It is particularly about midwives not only being clinical experts but fulfilling a variety of other roles: consultant, educator, researcher, innovator, clinical and professional leader, policy advisor, and ethical decision facilitator3,34. Acquired competencies of AMP extend the areas of leadership and management, research, and midwifery educator by incorporating advanced assessment and intervention strategies, analysis of complex interaction, use of research findings in decision making and management of these, development of woman-centered care and inclusion of education35. Studies show that the advanced practice role differs widely from those of clinical specialists. These include satisfaction with service delivery, emotional support and practical advice. Advanced practice roles offer strategic benefits, including better clinical and professional leadership, as well as more research and better service delivery36. Education for AMP is structured differently internationally. The entry criteria differ3,37, as some expect a Master’s degree for entry to AMP education35. Other countries offer AMP education as a Master’s program38.

Rationale of the review

As described above, there are some challenges that cannot be met with a Bachelor’s degree13. In fact, a Master’s degree is required for specific challenges that relate to management13,14,18, research19 and teaching20,21 tasks as well as for advanced practitioner roles22. As the Master’s programs in midwifery differ both at European12 as well as international level23, the question arises as to how the Master’s programs address these three areas and how AMP programs go beyond these areas.

To approach this, the review points out the competence goals of the Master’s programs. Competence goals provide a general statement about the expected abilities that graduates of a program should have39. To illustrate how the programs address these competence goals, the learning outcomes are examined as well. These make a specific and measurable statement on what a student or graduate will be able to do. A competence goal usually comprises several learning outcomes39.

Objective and research questions

The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of Master’s programs in midwifery in selected OECD countries. Besides organizational aspects, the focus lies on competence goals and learning outcomes of the Master’s programs. This provides an overview for the actors involved to develop or enhance Master’s programs in midwifery and to demonstrate the different approaches on how to educate midwives at Master’s level. The research questions were: 1) ‘Which commonalities and differences of organizational aspects in Master’s programs in midwifery occur?’; and 2) ‘On which competence goals and learning outcomes are the Master’s programs in midwifery based on?’.

The narrative review study design

The study design as a narrative review provides a broad overview of a specific topic as well as quickly inform about the current state-of-the-art40. Narrative reviews are considered an important tool in medical education and are commonly used in medical literature syntheses41. Since the objective was to obtain an overview of a relevant topic in medical education, this study design was highly suitable. To ensure adequate quality, Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) was applied42. In addition, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement43 was considered in the parts suitable for a narrative review (Supplementary file).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The criteria primarily focused on the Master’s programs. Included were Master’s programs localized at universities or universities of applied sciences in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. This was due to fact that Master’s programs are mostly offered in high-income countries8, as well as to ensure that midwives have similar basic conditions for practising as midwives. Still, there are differences in the health systems in every country44.

Included were Master’s programs that focused on midwifery science or equivalent as well as advanced midwifery practice. Master’s programs were included that served as pre-service or postgraduate education for midwives. Excluded were Master’s programs that exclusively focused on nursing or related discipline without specific midwifery relation.

Search strategy and selection procedure

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from June to December 2023. The process was divided into three phases.

Literature and database search

In the first phase, the focus lied on a sensitive literature search approach. The aim was to search as comprehensively as possible in different databases with general keywords45. Therefore, the following databases were screened: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Educational Resources Information Center, Academic Search Premier and Wiley Online Library. The used search terms were: midwif*, academic education, higher education, master’s degree, master’s program, master*, postgraduate education, advanced practice*, and international*. These search terms were combined in different search strings, which were assembled with the Boolean operators (Supplementary file Tables 1–5). Articles published from the year 2000 onwards and written in English or German were included. In addition, the snowball method was applied (screening the reference list of relevant publications) as well as a free web search on Google to further identify Master’s programs in midwifery.

The search strategy was conducted by two independent researchers. Both researchers documented their search strings and the number of results. After screening relevant articles, each researcher listed their included articles as well as identified Master’s programs. Subsequently, one of the two researchers reviewed the results, which overlapped considerably. This ensured inter-rater reliability46. If there were any results that did not correspond, these were verified by a researcher and included if appropriate. The search strategy was documented in a PRISMA flow chart (Figure 1).

Figure 1 PRISMA flowchart for narrative review (2024)

Selection of Master’s programs in midwifery

After the search for literature, the relevant Master’s programs in midwifery were extracted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These programs were identified by the described process of two independent researchers. The Master’s programs were selected through the identified literature (Figure 1), that referred to institutions of higher education in midwifery. Subsequently, one of the researchers screened the official websites of these institutions for Master’s programs in midwifery. A free web search for Master’s programs in midwifery was conducted by the same researcher in the countries identified through literature search. The described approach to select Master’s programs in midwifery tried to filter relevant programs, as not all OECD countries could be screened in the free web search separately due to insufficient personnel resources. If several relevant study programs were identified in one country, the following procedure was followed: the competence areas and organizational aspects of the study programs were screened. If the programs competence areas differed, both were included. However, if the programs had alike competence areas and differed little in terms of organization, one of the programs was selected at random. This finally led to the selection of Master’s programs in midwifery that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Identifying the characteristics of the included Master’s programs in midwifery

In the third and final phase, the included Master’s programs in midwifery were analyzed by one researcher according to the defined educational characteristics. These were synthesized in tabular form for the extracted Master’s programs in midwifery. For the first research question, the following organizational characteristics were extracted: program name, academic degree and institution; entry requirements; course length, full-time or part-time; in person or online; language; tuition; and clinical practice, pre-service education pathway for midwives. Tuition fees were listed in local currencies at the official websites. To ensure comparability, tuition fees have been consistently converted to euros (at the exchange rate on 14th August 2023) and rounded to whole numbers. Focusing on the second research question, the following characteristics were extracted: competence goals and learning outcomes of the Master’s programs. The official websites of the study programs as well as the websites of national midwifery associations were screened for the necessary information.

Selection of relevant studies

The PRISMA flow chart summarizes the search process (Figure 1). A total of 1867946 results were identified from the databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, ERIC, Academic Search Premier and Wiley Online Library as well as the free web search. In the pre-selection process, 42 abstracts were screened and 10 duplicates removed. After assessing 37 full texts for eligibility, 28 texts were excluded due to non-compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as the research questions. Finally, 9 articles and 6 additional websites were included in the narrative review. After reviewing the extracted literature (Figure 1), 12 countries and 15 Master’s programs in midwifery were included in the narrative review (Tables 1 and 2).

MASTER’S PROGRAMS IN MIDWIFERY

Organizational aspects of the reviewed Master’s programs in midwifery

The review included 15 Master’s programs (Table 1) in midwifery from 12 OECD countries: Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, Türkiye, UK, and USA. Australia, Austria and Ireland each include two Master’s programs. Similarities and differences within organizational characteristics of the Master’s programs are identified: all 15 Master’s programs award the title Master of Science38,47-60; 13 of the programs focus on Master in Midwifery (or equivalent)47-52,54-60, while two of them pursue AMP38,53. Six of the programs require a minimum knowledge of English48-50,54,55,59. Seven of the programs teach in English47,51-53,57,58,60, which is their official language or mother tongue. Eight programs teach in their native language other than English38,48-50,54-56,59. In addition, seven of the programs offer their courses both online and in person47-49,52-54,60. Major differences between the programs are the admission requirements and qualification. Three of the analyzed Master’s programs are pre-service education for midwives, requiring a Bachelor’s degree in nursing as well as practical experience for admission. These post-nursing Master’s programs allow a first-time registration as a midwife after completion47,50,56. 12 of the Master’s programs serve as postgraduate midwifery education. They require a Bachelor’s degree in midwifery and a registration as a midwife for admission38,48,49,51-55,57-60. Five of the study programs integrate clinical practice47,50,53,56,59, while four allow projects or internships in different intuitions48,49,55,60.

Two of the programs recommend working in clinical practice alongside the study course38,54, whereas four of the programs do not require any clinical practice at all51,52,57,58. Differences are identified in the study length, as durations of 1–4 years in part-time or full-time in six programs38,47,51,52,57,60, only part-time with 2–3 years in five programs38,49,53,54,58, or only full-time with 1.5–2 years in four programs50,55,56,59 are possible. Another central difference is found in the tuition fees that differed enormously between the countries, e.g. more than €40000 per academic year for domestic students in the USA47, up to no fees at all for domestic students in Norway56.

Competence goals and learning outcomes of the Master’s programs in midwifery

Similarities and differences can be identified in terms of the competence goals and learning outcomes of the Master’s programs (Table 2). The ability to undertake research is a central competence goal in all 12 programs38,47-60. This is accomplished in the different study programs through various learning outcomes. Graduates should be able to apply research methods after completing their studies48,51,53,57-60 or have the ability to integrate professional knowledge into a scientific, evidence-based context38,48,50,54,59 as well as to promote evidence-based practice38,50-52,54. Furthermore, graduates should be able to verify evidence and conduct one’s own research project38,49-52,57-60. In this context, seven of the programs educate for the ability to think and reflect critically47,51,52,55,57,59,60. Six of the programs also integrate scientific and midwifery theories in their studies48,49,52,55,56,60. Ultimately, all these competence goals and learning outcomes in the area of research, aim to enable their graduates to further develop midwifery practice38,47-60.

Twelve of the programs focus on abilities for leadership and management38,48,49,51-57,59,60. This is addressed by the learning outcomes of graduates being able for effective teamwork48,51,55-57 as well as effective communication38,48,49,51,53,55-57. Graduates should be able to take on (clinical) management tasks38,48,49,52-56,59,60, such as quality management38,49,53-55,60 and/or project responsibilities38,48,52,53,55. Moreover, graduates should be able to take on leading positions38,48,49,52-56.

A central key competence in seven programs is to enable graduates to educate midwives38,48,49,51,55,56,59 in theory and practice38,48,55,56,59; for example, in clinical education51,55,56 but also for further professional qualifications48. In addition, the ability to educate patients based to their informational needs is enabled59. To address the mentioned abilities for education midwives, graduates should be able to apply theories of teaching as well as theories of learning48,49,55,59.

Another competence goal that can be found in nine of the Master’s programs are abilities for ethical aspects in midwifery and healthcare38,48,50,52,53,55-57,59, whereas only four programs enable graduates skills for legal and judicial aspects in midwifery and healthcare52,53,55,59. Moreover, eight of the programs focus on the competence goal of abilities for psychological as well as sociological dimensions of midwifery care38,49-51,54,55,59,60. A further competence goal of eight programs is to enable graduates’ advanced clinical skills47-49,52-54,57,60. Whereas ten programs focus on woman-centered care38,48-52,55,57,59,60, five programs focus on family-centered care48-50,57,59. Another competence goals in three of the programs is to enable skills in cultural competence38,51,57. Competence goals that can only be identified in Master’s programs focusing on AMP are abilities for obstetric emergency situations and peripartum monitoring38, trauma psychology38, fault management38, dealing with power conflicts38, prescribing medicinal products and ionizing radiation53, as well as abilities to practice with the highest professional level throughout the entire spectrum of care53. In general, overlapping competence goals can be identified, whereas the learning outcomes differ to address these competence goals.

Summary of the findings and answers to the research questions

The narrative review includes 15 Master’s programs in midwifery from 12 OECD countries (Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, Türkiye, UK, and USA). Considering the organizational aspects of Master’s programs in midwifery (answering research question 1), several similarities can be identified. The awarded title Master of Science in midwifery (or equivalent)38,47-60 is common to all of the programs, although two especially focus on AMP38,53. Basic knowledge in English is required in 13 of the programs47-55,57-60. Differences can be identified, among other things, within admission requirements and qualification level (primary qualification47,50,56 or postgraduate program38,48,49,51-55,57-60) and the integration of clinical practice (from no clinical practice51,52,57,61 to integrating clinical practice or projects38,47,48,50,53,55,56,59,60).

Analyzing the competence goals and learning outcomes of the Master’s programs (answering research question 2), commonalities can be found within the competence goals. The objective for research competence underlies all 15 programs, with the overall purpose of further developing midwifery practice38,47-60. Another competence goal of 12 the programs is the ability for leadership and management38,48,49,51-57,59,60, which is mostly addressed by graduates being able for effective teamwork48,51,55-57 and effective communication38,48,49,51,53,55-57. Furthermore, seven of the programs aim for the ability to take over tasks in midwifery education38,48,49,51,55,56,59. Other competence goals are the ability to deal with ethical aspects of midwifery and healthcare38,48,50,52,53,55-57,59, as well as psychological and sociological skills38,49-51,54,55,59,60. In addition, graduates are enabled for advanced clinical skills47-49,52-54,57,60, mostly focusing on woman-centered care38,48-52,55,57,59,60. Although the overarching competence goals mostly align, differences can be identified within the learning outcomes to address these competences. For example, while five of the programs educate research competence by graduates being able to promote on evidence-based practice38,50-52,54, 10 of the programs focus on graduates being able to implement a research project38,49-52,57-60.

Competences of midwives with a Master’s degree: Management and leadership

The SoWMy states that investment in midwifery leadership and governance are urgently needed to improve quality and safety of maternity care8. To enable strong leadership, the roots are already planted in the education of midwives18. The integration of leadership and management skills is recommended for undergraduate and postgraduate education62. However, many midwives are not able to find appropriate leadership and management positions after their primary qualification due to a lack of leadership opportunities8 or not having enough specialized leadership skills63. In addition to professional work experience64, further education that develops specific management and leadership skills is useful65. This is reflected within the analyzed Master’s programs, as many of them focus on abilities for management and leadership38,48,49,51-57,59,60. To fulfil management and leadership tasks, midwives should have knowledge about cooperate management issues to integrate and understand policy direction and commissioning. Moreover, midwives in leadership and management positions should have the ability to understand the wider healthcare system. Midwives need to develop negotiation, persuasion and influencing skills as well as political astuteness to take on leadership and management roles. To build these competences, midwives need to understand the structure as well as the language of the systems they are working in, especially focusing on safety and quality, finances and resources as well as workforce planning and modernization66. In general, these competences are found in the Master’s programs examined as their learning outcomes focus on graduates being able to take on clinical management tasks38,48,49,52-56,59,60, but it is not clear within the scope of the review to what extent these abilities are developed.

In addition to contextual understanding, professional experience is equally important. This includes, for instance, experience in project management64, which is also a central learning outcome of many Master’s programs examined38,48,52,53,55. Furthermore, the ability to communicate effectively is a central component of midwifery leadership. Another central ability is to lead teams towards visions and goals they share64. Both effective teamwork48,51,55-57 as well as effective communication38,48,49,51,53,55-57 is trained within the Master’s programs. After all, midwifery leadership and management is about changing the future of midwifery64, which many of the analyzed Master’s programs refer to38,47-60.

Research is an integral part of midwife’s role19. Internationally, research opportunities and careers in research for midwives are increasingly expanding. This is necessary to provide efficient and cost-effective care that adapts to changing needs of consumers and society67. In its ‘International Code of Ethics for Midwives’, the ICM describes that midwives use up-to-date data and professional evidence-based knowledge for safe midwifery practice as well as actively participate in research68. However, evidence-based practice and research are seen as a challenge for midwifery students69 as well as practitioners21. A tension between evidence-based practice as well as research and practice is reported69. Reasons for this include the lack of clinically active midwives with solid scientific training in many places have67 and their lack of influence on the framework conditions and the control of these via management positions8. Embedding elements of evidence-based practice and research in the primary qualification of midwives is not enough to ensure that evidence-based practice can be implemented within the actual work as a midwife69-71. Rather, to prepare midwives for research activities, they should complete Master’s or doctoral programs19,67, where comprehensive research abilities are developed. A highly relevant ability for midwifery research is the ability for interdisciplinary cooperation. The reason lies within the fact that the contribution from other disciplines and interdisciplinary exchange are seen as extremely valuable source of knowledge to midwifery research72. This is enabled by most of the analyzed Master’s programs by the learning outcomes of graduates being able for effective teamwork48,51,55-57 as well as for effective communication38,48,49,51,53,55-57. However, despite the relevant contribution of other disciplines, it is necessary to find a separate identity for midwifery research with a perspective on midwifery care. Therefore, midwifery researchers should be familiar with appropriate qualitative and quantitative methods and balance these approaches carefully72. The analyzed Master’s programs address this by the learning outcome of graduates being able to apply different research methods48,51,53,57-60. Despite the abilities to conduct research72, transferring findings into evidence-based practice is an essential ability for midwives. Studies show that this is enabled by reading and reviewing literature as well as translating these findings into evidence-based practice19,73. Moreover, midwives should be able to disseminate literature to health professionals in a purposeful way73. Many of the Master’s programs analyzed here focus on the named abilities for transferring findings into evidence-based practice38,48,50-52,54,59. After all, midwifery research refers to how midwives work and how midwifery practice can be improved72, which is why qualified midwives with a Master’s degree are needed19.

Competences of midwives with a Master’s degree: Midwifery educators

To educate competent midwives and enable midwives for careers in research, leadership and practice, it is essential to have competent midwifery teachers20,74. Of the 15 analyzed Master’s programs in this review, only seven explicitly refer to the competence goal of midwifery educator38,48,49,51,55,56,59. However, when considering the midwifery educator competency domains defined by the WHO20, many of the programs prepare graduates for those competency domains, even without making explicit reference to midwifery educator. According to the WHO, midwifery educators should base their knowledge and skills of midwifery on the best available evidence20. All analyzed programs refer to the competence goal of research abilities38,47-60 as well as to the learning outcomes of graduates being able to promote evidence-based practice38,50-52,54. Another research-related competency domain of the WHO refers to midwifery education and practice being informed and developed through research20. All the analyzed programs aim to enable graduates to further develop midwifery practice through research competence38,47-60. In addition, another competency domain of the WHO focusses on effective communication, acting as advocates, change agents, and leaders20. This is also reflected in many of the considered programs, as they enable graduates for leaders38,48,49,51-57,59,60, as well as for effective communication38,48,49,51,53,55-57. However, there are other competency domains of the WHO, referring to pedagogical and didactical skills, such as creating an environment for facilitating teaching and learning20. These areas are not met within many of the analyzed programs, as only a few train abilities for teaching and learning48,49,55,59. This can be seen critically, as adult education requires specialized teaching skills. These include knowledge in adult education theories, the ability to apply teaching methods effectively, and therefore support students and their individually needs74.

Competences of midwives with a Master’s degree: AMP profile

As some of the analyzed Master’s programs qualified for AMP, the question arises to what distinguishes them from the other programs examined. The competence areas of leadership and management, research and education are also represented within the AMP Master’s programs. However, AMP programs emphasize an explicitly focus on leadership and research38,53. Literature shows that research skills are an essential attribute of AMP, which is why AMP Master’s programs place major focus on this competence22. Moreover, leadership skills of advanced practitioners are highlighted as an increasingly important factor for improving patient outcomes. Although, as already argued, all midwives with a Master’s degree should be suitable for management positions, advanced practitioners are particularly well-suited as have additional responsibility for professional development and a high level of expertise. Moreover, they have complex decision-making skills73,75. That is also reflected within the analyzed AMP Master’s programs as they specialize on the entire spectrum of care by educating clinical decision-making as well as emergency strategies38,53. AMP programs develop skills that enable a higher level of judgement, discretion and decision-making in all practical settings37. They also educate for specific diagnostic skills37, which can be found in one of the analyzed Master’s programs as competence goals38. In conclusion, AMP Master’s programs extend the other programs by enabling specialization and expansion of knowledge, abilities and autonomy in the named areas and beyond22.

Post-nursing and postgraduate Master’s programs in midwifery

There were two different types of Master’s programs included in this review (post-nursing and postgraduate Master’s programs in midwifery). On the one hand, it is known from related disciplines that postgraduate Master’s programs improve knowledge and skills as well as improve patient outcomes76. With postgraduate Master’s programs midwives have further career opportunities, such as in research, education, management or consultancy. Moreover, besides personal benefits for graduates, Master’s programs in midwifery provide the necessary skills to maintain the autonomous professional role of midwives77. Studies also show that midwives have a higher level of pedagogical, management and research skills after completing a postgraduate Master’s program. However, there is still a lack of opportunities to apply these skills in practice21. On the other hand, it is known from nursing that a four-year primary qualification is associated with better performance and patient outcomes78. The post-nursing qualifications for midwives usually have a longer duration. As a result, a high amount of flexibility of graduates is reported79. Studies indicate that graduates of post-nursing Master’s programs benefit from changes in attitudes, perceptions, knowledge and skills as well as their application in practice80. Overall, there is very little evidence on how competencies, costs, career paths or other outcomes differ from each other considering the different educational pathways of midwifery9.

Adaption of Master’s programs to country-specific characteristics

While there are many standards for undergraduate midwifery education14-16, much fewer standards exist for postgraduate education as they only refer to general classifications of education28,29. There were clear patterns in terms of competence goals and learning outcomes of the analyzed Master’s programs that could also be embedded in literature (see above). Nevertheless, is should be noted, that country-specific adaptions for postgraduate education are necessary. The reason lies within the fact that there are considerable differences in the integration of the midwifery profession into healthcare systems, both within and between countries8,44. This ranges from regulation and scope of practice to involvement in care8,44 as well as different educational systems8,9. The influence of the professional organizations on the curricula and the different educational programs also varies from country to country81. Considering the analyzed competence areas, it is clear that midwifery research is a country-specific phenomenon, as each country approaches midwifery research differently, especially in terms of addressed topics and integration of research in the professional role for midwives72. As the career opportunities for midwifery researcher differ internationally19,72,82, the country-specific characteristics of midwifery research is needed to be considered in the various Master’s programs. Considering the competences of midwifery educators discussed20,26, some of them are specifically aligned towards national healthcare systems. For example, midwifery educators should be able to understand and demonstrate the ethical and legal principles of midwifery20. Whereas the ethical principles of midwifery are recognized in official international documents of the ICM68, there are country-specific characteristics especially in terms of regulatory and legal aspects of midwifery8. For effective midwifery leadership, the ICM recommends focusing on the structures of each country and its specific healthcare system18. Consequently, it is clear, that a systematic adaption of the Master’s programs and their competence goals to country-specific characteristics of their healthcare systems8,21, their integration of the role of midwives21, as well as educational systems8,9,81, is considered reasonable and necessary.

Recommendations for research

Similarities and differences of organizational aspects as well as of competence goals and learning outcomes were identified. Three research gaps emerge from this review: 1) The analyzed similarities and differences can serve as an indication for further research as Master’s programs of many countries need to be analyzed in detail to collect more data. The purpose of further research is to find the core elements of Master’s programs in midwifery that are equally important for each program; and 2) This review has also shown that in addition to these core elements, there are relevant country-specific characteristics each Master’s program has to address differently. To fully understand which organizational aspects as well as competence goals and learning outcomes need to be adapted to individual circumstances, further research is necessary; and 3) Finally, it is important to examine the impact of Master’s programs, especially regarding the educational pathways, on health outcomes and national healthcare systems.

Limitations

A central limitation of this review is the study design. The narrative review follows a systematic approach42,43, nevertheless, it is possible that relevant Master’s programs and publications have been missed. In conducting the search for identifying Master’s programs in midwifery, the primary source of information was academic literature. A free web search was consulted only secondarily. Consequently, it can be assumed that a number of relevant programs were overlooked. Some countries, e.g. Greece, have a number Master’s programs in midwifery83 that were not identified through the aforementioned method. Moreover, the needed information on the characteristics of the Master’s programs is mostly found on the official websites of their institutions, rarely in scientific articles. Still, it can be assumed that the universities have trustworthy websites. As the search was mainly conducted in English, and partly German, study programs which maintain their websites only in their native language (if not English or German) and do not have corresponding publications, could not be identified. Another limitation is the different health systems and midwifery roles as the Master’s programs originate in different countries44. By focusing on OECD countries, up to a certain point a comparison is possible, nevertheless significant differences exist in the health and education systems even within these countries84. However, this can also be seen as being positive, as the countries can learn from each other. Beyond these limitations, the study did perform a systematic approach to the literature search (as far as possible). Two independent researchers conducted the literature search, and each listed separately their search strings, number of results, relevant articles and Master’s programs. The results overlapped considerably, which increases the inter-rater reliability46. The results were, however, analyzed by one researcher only. Overall, the generalizability of the results is limited by the named aspects. Still, the results allow a solid overview and provide indications for practitioners, researchers and other involved actors.

CONCLUSION

Master’s programs in midwifery prepare for challenges that cannot be met with a Bachelor’s degree13. These especially refer to management13,14,18, research19, teaching20,21 tasks as well as advanced practitioner roles22. This review analysed 15 Master’s programs in midwifery in 12 selected OECD countries. Organizational commonalities (e.g. awarded title) as well as organizational differences (e.g. admission requirements) were identified. There are central core elements that underlie most of the Master’s programs analyzed, especially referring to competence goals. Nevertheless, these competence goals are addressed differently through adverse learning outcomes. As there is a need to adapt the Master’s programs to the national context, further research on core elements as well as adaption to country-specific characteristics is needed8,9,21,81. As there is little evidence on Master’s programs in midwifery, this review serves as a starting point for further research.
