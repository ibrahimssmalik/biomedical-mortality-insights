Abstract

Background

Paratemnoides Harvey, 1991 is currently represented by 28 species and two subspecies, which are widespread in the world, except for Europe and Antarctica. Paratemnoidessinensis (Beier, 1932) represents the only species of this genus currently recorded from China.

New information

Five new Paratemnoides species collected from China are described, including detailed diagnoses and illustrations: P.guangdongensis sp. nov. from Guangdong, P.parvus sp. nov., P.politus sp. nov. and P.yunnanensis sp. nov. from Yunnan and P.trisulcus sp. nov. from Guangxi. An identification key to all known Paratemnoides species from China and a distribution map are also provided.

The pseudoscorpion family Atemnidae Kishida, 1929, belonging to the superfamily Cheliferoidea Risso, 1827, is currently represented by two subfamilies (Atemninae Beier, 1932 and Miratemninae Beier, 1932). The reciprocal monophyly of the two subfamilies remains to be confirmed and it is generally assumed that the main difference between them is the position of the tactile setae on the tarsus of leg Ⅳ (near base vs. near middle) and the number of setae on the cheliceral hand (four vs. five) (Kishida 1929, Chamberlin 1933, Dumitresco and Orghidan 1970, Harvey 1991, Harvey 1992, Klausen 2005). Atemnidae can be easily distinguished from the other three families in Cheliferoidea by the position of venom apparatus: venom apparatus only present in fixed chelal finger vs. only present in movable chelal finger (Chernetidae Menge, 1855) or in both chelal fingers (Cheliferidae Risso, 1827 and Withiidae Chamberlin, 1931). At present, Atemnidae contains 20 extant genera and one fossil genus (Progonatemnus Beier, 1955), with a total of 187 species (15 species in five genera are known from China). Of these, 15 genera and 165 species belong to the subfamily Atemninae and the rest belong to the subfamily Miratemninae (WPC 2024).

Paratemnoides Harvey, 1991, one of the genera within the subfamily Atemninae, is currently represented by 28 species, which are widespread in the world, except for Europe and Antarctica. The main distribution of countries belonging to Asia are Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Paratemnoidessinensis (Beier, 1932) represents the only species of this genus currently distributed in China (WPC 2024). The genus can be diagnosed as follows: carapace smooth and glossy, without furrow; tergites incompletely divided; pedipalp stout, surface smooth or with granulations on prolateral surface; palpal trochanter with two well-developed granular tubercles; trichobothrium it situated near the middle of the fixed chelal finger and distance between it and fingertip further than distance between ist and isb; st closer to sb than to t; legs moderately stout, a long tactile seta of leg IV situated near the base of tarsal segment (Beier 1932, Murthy and Ananthakrishnan 1977, Mathew and Joseph 2019).

During the identification of atemnid pseudoscorpion specimens collected in 2018 and 2019, five new species, belonging to Paratemnoides were found and which are described with detailed diagnoses, descriptions and illustrations.

Materials and methods

The specimens were preserved in 75% ethanol and deposited in the Museum of Hebei University (MHBU) (Baoding, China). Photographs were taken with a Leica M205A stereomicroscope equipped with a Leica DFC550 camera and the LAS software v. 4.6 and the Leica M205A stereomicroscope with a drawing tube was used for drawings and measurements. The chela and the chelal hand were measured in ventral view. Detailed examination was carried out with an Olympus BX53 compound light microscope. Temporary slide mounts were made in glycerol.

Terminology and measurements mostly follow Chamberlin (1931), with some minor modifications to the terminology of trichobothria (Harvey 1992), chelicerae (Judson 2007) and male genitalia (Klausen 2005). All measurements are given in mm.

The following abbreviations are used for the trichobothria: b, basal; sb, sub-basal; st, sub-terminal; t, terminal; ib, interior basal; isb, interior sub-basal; ist, interior sub-terminal; it, interior terminal; eb, exterior basal; esb, exterior sub-basal; est, exterior sub-terminal; et, exterior terminal. Cheliceral setae: es, exterior seta; is, interior seta; ls, laminal seta; bs, basal seta; sbs, sub-basal seta. Male genitalia: a, lateral apodeme; br, hooked branch; c, sclerotised bar; d, longitudinal fold of medial diverticulum; e, ejaculatory canal atrium; f, lateral rods; g, dorsal apodeme; h, ventral diverticulum; l, lateral lip of lateral apodeme.
