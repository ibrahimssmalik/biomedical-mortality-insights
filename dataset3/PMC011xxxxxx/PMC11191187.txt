Following the publication of the original article [1], we have been notified that the study site mentioned under “Methods: Study Setting” should read “Eskenazi Health affiliated with Indiana University (IU)” instead of “Indiana University Health University Hospital”, as shown below:

“The study setting will be five US medical centers with interdisciplinary palliative care teams: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Medical Center (UNC), Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School (MGH), Eskenazi Health affiliated with Indiana University (IU), UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital (UC), and Emory University Healthcare System (EU).”
