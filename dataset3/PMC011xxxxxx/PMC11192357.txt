Several studies have reported the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), while some ophthalmologists are concerned that TCM may be a risk factor for CSC as some chinese herbs contain hormonal ingredients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCM in treating patients with CSC. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of TCM for CSC were searched up to July 10, 2023 on the following biological databases without language and publication time restrictions: PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Technology Periodical Database (VIP), Wanfang, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System (SinoMed). Review Manager V.5.4.1 and Stata 14 software were used for data analysis. Finally, thirty-eight studies were finally included including 23 RCTs and 15 cohort studies. The meta-analysis showed that compared with the routine treatment alone, the combination of TCM can not only reduce the recurrence rate (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.21,0.40; I2 = 0%) and central retinal thickness (CRT) (MD = - 35.63, 95% CI: - 45.96,-25.30; I2 = 89%) of CSC, but improve patients’ best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.62,1.11; I2 = 77%); additionally, it has no obvious side effects compared with routine treatment (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.39,1.34; I2 = 10%). Overall, this study shows that the use of TCM does not increase the risk of CSC recurrence; on the contrary, the combination of TCM may reduce the recurrence of CSC and improve BCVA and CRT in patients with CSC compared with conventional treatment.

pmcIntroduction

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a chorioretinal disease characterized by serous detachment of the neurosensory retina, accompanied by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lesions and hyperpermeability of the choroid [1]. Typical manifestations of CSC include loss of central vision, central blindness, microvision, or deformity. It is one of the 10 most common disorders in the back of the eye and is a common cause of mild to moderate vision impairment. The reported incidence of CSC is 10 cases per 100,000 men and 2 cases per 100,000 women [2]. In most cases, CSC is self-limiting, and patients’ vision and symptoms recover within 3 months [2]. However, according to published literature [3], the recurrence rate of CSC is 25–50%, which can lead to poor prognosis and even permanent blindness [1].

Currently known risk factors for CSC include genetic risk [4], corticosteroids [5], endocrinological abnormalities [1, 6], pregnancy [7], etc. Corticosteroids, in particular, are considered to be strongly associated with CSC and are recommended not to be used in the treatment of CSC because of the risk of further exacerbating the disease [8].

Current treatments for CSC mainly include photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy [9]. However, PDT is not available in all countries and PDT itself has serious side effects, including ocular events such as choroidal ischemia and subsequent retinal atrophy, as well as systemic events such as headache, back pain, nausea, dyspnea, dizziness, and syncope [9–11]. Conventional laser photocoagulation is only suitable for treating extrafoveal leakage points, and its efficacy against CSC remains unclear. In addition, adverse events such as scotoma, vision loss, reduced contrast sensitivity, and/or macular neovascularization (MNV) may occur in the treated area due to damage to the neuralretina-RPE-Bruch’s membrane [9, 12]. The efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment in treating CSC still lacks clear evidence and the treatment is limited to patients with concurrent macular neovascularization [9, 13]. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new adjuvant therapeutic measures for CSC.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a characteristic medical treatment in China, is widely used in China and even Asia. TCM has been widely used in a variety of fundus diseases involving edema and hemorrhagic lesions, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein obstruction, and is believed to promote the absorption of fundus edema [14–17]. Therefore, TCM is also commonly used to treat CSC in China. However, some clinicians are concerned that Chinese medicines are risk factors for CSC because some of them contain hormonal components or hormone-like effects [18, 19]. Currently, there is a lack of conclusive evidence to prove the relationship between TCM and CSC. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of recent studies on herbal interventions in patients with CSC, especially those containing hormonal components or having hormone-like effects, to observe the effects of TCM on CSC.

Methods

Study registration and ethics statements

This meta-analysis was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42023428288) and strictly adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) [20]. As this study was a reanalysis of published papers and did not involve additional human trials, it did not require ethics committee approval or consent.

Inclusion criteria

This meta-analysis included Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies involving patients diagnosed with CSC. Interventions that contained TCM in the intervention group were included, including oral administration of herbs, herbal medicines, herbal capsules, and proprietary Chinese medicines. Studies in the intervention group that combine TCM treatment with treatment in the control group were also included, while studies that combine treatment outside of TCM were excluded. In addition, studies of intravenous input and topical application of herbal medicines were excluded. Interventions in the control group contained conventional treatment measures such as medications to improve fundus microcirculation, vitamin-based supplements, PDT, anti-VEGF, and laser therapy, as well as placebo and no treatment. The recurrence rate of CSC and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were set as primary outcomes, and central retinal thickness (CRT) and adverse events were set as secondary outcomes.

Exclusion criteria

Studies involving any of the following were not included: 1) studies containing herbal medicines in both control and intervention groups; 2) the treatment in the intervention group included treatments out of TCM in addition to the control group interventions; 3) case series; 4) no full text; and 5) studies in which key information was unclear or unknown and no results were available after contacting the authors.

Search strategy

Relevant literature was searched in the following databases: PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Technology Periodical Database (VIP), Wanfang, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System (SinoMed). The search time was from inception to July 10, 2023, without language and publication time restrictions. In addition, relevant web pages were also manually searched (www.clinicaltrials.gov; www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu; trialsearch.who.int) for ongoing trials or unpublished clinical trial reports. The specific search strategy can be found in S1 Table.

Data extraction

Two reviewers conducted a literature search independently (JS and SR). After screening out the duplicate documents in EndNote software, a preliminary review was carried out by reading the titles and abstracts of the retrieved documents. The literature that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria was read in full to determine its eligibility for further inclusion. For eligible trials, two reviewers (LY and JW) independently extracted information based on a predesigned standardized template, including (1) study characteristics (study year, country, and study type); (2) patient characteristics, including the information of sample size, sex, age, CSC type (acute, < 6 months; chronic, ≥ 6 months), etc; (3) details of intervention measures (TCM composition, frequency, and duration of treatment); and (4) clinical outcome indicators. Any differences between the two reviewers were resolved through communication and negotiation with an arbiter.

Quality assessment

The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated independently by two reviewers (JS and HS) according to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0) as follows [21]: randomization process, deviations from the intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome and selection of the reported result. For each item, we divided the research into "high", "unclear", and "low" risk of bias. The overall risk of bias for each study was evaluated based on S2 Table. The quality of observational studies was evaluated using the Newcastle ‐ Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS) [22]. When there was insufficient information to make a judgment, we inquired about relevant information to the corresponding author via email. Any controversies were settled through consultation with the third reviewer (WS).

Data analysis

ReviewManager (RevMan) version 5.4.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) was used for the meta-analysis. Continuous outcome variables were calculated by mean differences (MDs) or standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and dichotomous outcome variables were calculated by combined odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs. When the heterogeneity of outcome variables was low (P > 0.10, I2 < 50%), the fixed-effect model was used; otherwise, the random-effect model was used. Publication bias was evaluated visually by creating funnel plots via RevMan 5.4.1 version, as well as by conducting Egger’s regression test using STATA 14.0 version (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) [23]. Subgroup analysis was performed by intervention type (with or without TCM contained hormone component), CSC type (acute, < 6 months; chronic, ≥ 6 months), intervention type (PDT, laser, et al), or intervention course. Sensitivity analyses were performed to observe changes in synthetic results according to the following operations: 1) excluding low-quality studies; 2) excluding studies with small sample size; 3) excluding studies with the largest sample size; 4) excluding studies containing Chinese patent medicine; 5) or switching between fixed and random effects models. For indicators that were not sufficient for the meta-analysis, a narrative description was made [24].

Quality of evidence

The quality of the pooled evidence for all the outcomes was judged by two independent reviewers with extensive work experience as ophthalmologists (LC) and TCM practitioners (WZ) according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system [25]. The strength of evidence was graded as “high”, “moderate”, “low” or “very low” based on five assessment items: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations. Any controversies were settled through consultation with the third reviewer (WS).

Results

Literature search

A total of 1826 articles were included, of which 988 studies were removed due to duplication. After reading the titles and abstracts, 360 articles remained (478 articles were removed, including 167 irrelevant articles, 189 reviews, and 122 case reports and case series). Of these, 114 used inappropriate controls, 128 lacked indicators of interest, 71 lacked key information, and 9 involved duplicate publications. Finally, 38 studies were included [26–63] (Fig 1). See S1 Table for details.

Characteristics of the included studies

All studies were conducted in China and included 23 RCTs [26, 27, 29–42, 44,45, 50, 53–56], 14 retrospective cohort studies [43, 46–49, 51, 52, 57–63], and 1 prospective cohort study [28]. A total of 2849 patients (3063 eyes) were included. Among them, 23 studies (1739 individuals 1891 eyes) involving acute CSC (disease duration < 6 months), 6 studies (421 cases 442 eyes) of chronic CSC, and 9 studies (689 individuals 730 eyes) of mixed type. By reviewing the available information, the age range of the patients was 16–60 years, and the duration of the disease was 2 days-10 years. The interventions in the TCM group consisted of 35 articles on herbal medicines and 3 articles on proprietary Chinese medicines. According to pharmacological studies, herbal medicines that contain corticosteroid components or have hormone-like effects include antler velvet [64], ginseng [65], radix astragali [66], angelica sinensis [67], wolfberry fruit [68], schizandra [69], kudzu vine root, licorice, rhubarb, tragacanth, and herba epimedii [70].

This paper included 24 studies in which herbal medicines contained hormonal components or hormone-like effects [27, 30–32, 34–36, 39–47, 50, 51, 56–59, 61, 62].

Interventions in the control group included 30 articles on vitamin supplements/retinal microcirculation-improving drugs, 7 articles on laser, 2 articles on PDT, and 1 article on no treatment. The follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 2 years.

Regarding outcome indicators, 24 studies mentioned recurrence rate, 23 mentioned BCVA, 15 mentioned CRT, 7 mentioned adverse events, and 1 mentioned SRF area. Of these, BCVA was recorded in 18 studies using a standard visual acuity chart (decimal) [26–28, 30–35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 44, 48, 50, 53, 54], 2 using a 5 m Standard Logarithmic Visual Acuity (5SL) [42, 43], and 3 using the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) [36, 38, 47]. Table 1 lists the specific information from the studies included.

Risk of bias assessment

ROB was used to evaluate the risk of bias in 23 RCTs [26, 27, 29–42, 44, 45, 50, 53–56]. Eighteen studies reported randomization methods, 13 of which used random number tables [26, 30–37, 40–42, 50], two used lottery methods [29, 56], and three were based on the order of attendance [53–55]. No placebo was used in any of the studies. All studies did not mention allocation concealment, blinding of subjects, and outcome evaluation, and the risk of bias was determined to be "unclear". There was no case shedding in any of the studies. Ultimately, the overall risk of bias in 5 studies was assessed as “High” and 18 studies as “medium”.

Fifteen observational studies were evaluated using the NOS [28, 43, 46–49, 51, 52, 57–63], and all the patients were hospital-confirmed. One study took a prospective cohort [28], and the method of randomization was unknown. Fourteen studies used a retrospective cohort study. All studies proposed controls for age and gender factors. Follow-up was implemented in all but one study [48]. Of these, 11 [43, 46, 47, 49, 51, 52, 57, 58, 60–62] performed follow-ups of sufficient duration (follow-up ≥1 year). Overall, 12 studies were rated as high quality (NOS ≥7). See Table 2 for details.

Outcome measurements

Recurrence rate

Twenty-four studies mentioned the recurrence rate [28, 34, 37, 38, 43–47, 49–63], and the results suggested that the TCM group could reduce the recurrence rate of CSC compared with the conventional treatment group (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.21,0.40; I2 = 0%) (Fig 2). In addition, subgroup analyses showed that TCM reduced the recurrence rate regardless of whether it contained hormonal components or not.

10.1371/journal.pone.0304972.g002 Fig 2 The meta-analysis results of recurrence rate.

BCVA

BCVA was recorded in 18 studies using a standard visual acuity chart (decimal) [26–28, 30–35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 44, 48, 50, 53, 54] and 2 using a 5SL chart [42, 43], with very high heterogeneity in the results (I2 = 77%). The random-effect model indicated that there was a significant difference between the TCM group and the control group in terms of BCVA (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.62,1.11) (Fig 3A). In addition, subgroup analyses showed that the TCM group containing hormonal components also elevated BCVA in CSC patients compared to the conventional treatment group (SMD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.65,1.38).

10.1371/journal.pone.0304972.g003 Fig 3 The meta-analysis results of BCVA.

(A) BCVA (standard visual acuity chart / 5SL chart); (B) BCVA (logMAR).

BCVA was recorded in 3 studies using the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) [36, 38, 47], and the random-effects model showed no statistically significant difference between the TCM group and the conventional treatment group (MD = -0.02, 95% CI: -0.06,0.02) (Fig 3B).

CRT

CRT was mentioned in 15 studies [26–31, 34–38, 40, 42, 43, 48], with high heterogeneity in the results (I2 = 89%). The random-effect model suggested that the TCM group had reduced CRT compared with that in the control group (MD = - 35.63, 95% CI: - 45.96,-25.30) (Fig 4). In addition, subgroup analyses showed that TCM reduced the recurrence rate regardless of whether it contained hormonal components (MD = - 38.47, 95% CI: - 53.86,-23.08) or not (MD = - 33.72, 95% CI: - 49.47,-17.97).

10.1371/journal.pone.0304972.g004 Fig 4 The meta-analysis results of CRT.

Adverse events

Adverse events were reported in only 6 studies [26, 28, 29, 33, 42, 49], mainly including nausea, gastrointestinal reactions, panic, and subcutaneous hemorrhage and hardening accompanied by subcutaneous injection of drugs. The random effects model showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the TCM group and conventional treatment group (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.39,1.34; I2 = 10%), regardless of whether the TCM contained hormonal components or not. (Fig 5).

10.1371/journal.pone.0304972.g005 Fig 5 The meta-analysis results of adverse events.

Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis

Sensitivity analysis showed the stability of all the outcomes including the recurrence rate of CSC, BCVA, CRT, and adverse event rate.

For subgroup analyses, the heterogeneity of BCVA versus CRT outcomes decreased when limiting the duration of the intervention (≥2 Months), suggesting that the duration of the intervention was a source of heterogeneity. In addition, the heterogeneity of BAVC outcomes was significantly reduced when the type of restriction was an observational study. Subgroup analyses according to the type of CSC showed altered outcomes involving patients with mixed types of CSC, suggesting that the difference in recurrence rates between the TCM and conventional treatment groups was not statistically significant (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.25,1.07; I2 = 65%). See Tables 3 and 4 for details.

Narrative description

One study described SRF [38] and showed that SRF was 28.27 ± 18.52 d in the herbal group and 106.04 ± 83.38 d in the control group, which was statistically significant (p < 0.01).

Publication bias evaluation

The funnel plot based on recurrence rates is shown in Fig 6, with the majority of studies located in the upper middle of the funnel. Egger’s regression test was used to detect publication bias, and the result showed P = 0.052, indicating no significant publication bias (S1 Fig).

Discussion

The present meta-analysis showed that TCM did not trigger the risk of CSC recurrence; on the contrary, compared with conventional treatment, TCM treatment could reduce the recurrence of CSC. In addition, the results of the meta-analysis suggested that TCM had the effect of reducing CRT and improving BCVA, and had no significant side effects compared with conventional treatment. However, limited by the quality of included studies, the certainty of outcomes is a concern.

The use of corticosteroids is the most significant external risk factor for developing CSC, with odds ratios as high as 37:1 being reported [64]. Although rare, in some cases even minimal exposure to corticosteroids exposure has been associated with an increased risk, exacerbation, and/or recurrence of CSC [65, 66], suggesting that the increased risk of developing CSC is not solely dependent on the dose or mode of corticosteroid administration, but may also depend on genetic predisposition and/or an increased vulnerability to corticosteroid exposure in some individuals [9]. The mechanism of corticosteroid-induced CSC may be related to the activation of both the gluco- and the mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors. As MR over-activation is pathogenic in the retina and choroid, it could mediate the pathogenic effects of corticosteroids in CSC [67].

Some herbal medicines have been feared to cause recurrence and exacerbation of CSC because of their hormonal content. This study did not find evidence that herbal medicines induced CSC recurrence, even those containing hormonal components. There are several possible reasons for this: hormone-containing herbs account for a relatively small percentage of the components in the formula, and the content or activity of the hormone components is disturbed during heating and boiling or further processing [68]. In addition, some herbs mostly play a hormone-like pharmacological role, such as licorice [69] and ginseng [70]. Another possible reason is that Chinese medicines contain such a small amount of hormonal components that they cannot trigger significant side effects. Besides, the pharmacological actions of herbs are complex, and the interactions of multiple targets of action among individual drugs in the herbal formulas further interfere with the hormonal effects [71, 72].

The outcome of the meta-analysis of CRT shows that Chinese herbs could significantly reduce the thickness of retinal edema in patients with CSC, although the outcome is highly heterogeneous. Similarly, several studies have identified the absorption-promoting effects of TCM on fundus edema [14, 73, 74], and this process may involve multiple mechanisms. Choroidal dysfunction is considered to be the main etiology of CSC, and venous congestion, inflammation, and hemodynamic changes can lead to choroidal hyperpermeability and subsequent fluid leakage in CSC [75]. TCM has been found to improve fundus microcirculation and inhibit inflammation [74, 76–79], which may reduce fluid leakage and facilitate the absorption of edema. In addition, the activation of mineralocorticoid receptors can lead to recurrence and exacerbation of CSC [67], and there have been studies showing the modulation of mineralocorticoid activity by a variety of herbal medicines, which may also be one of the mechanisms of action of TCM in the treatment of CSC [80–82].

Our BCVA and CRT outcomes were highly heterogeneous, and subgroup analyses showed that part of the heterogeneity came from the type of study and the duration of the treatment intervention. We noted that the included studies used 3 visual acuity counting methods, including decimal VA, 5SL, and logMAR. Among them, decimal VA and 5SL charts account for the majority of the included studies (decimal VA,18/23; 5SL, 2/23). In China, both decimal VA and 5SL charts are commonly used in screening, ophthalmology clinic. However, there are some differences between the two approaches and the logMAR recording method. Decimal charts have an irregular progression in size and are often truncated, especially in the lines testing low acuity, whereby only one or three optotypes are presented per line. Thus, the data may not follow a normal distribution, and this problem is not overcome merely by converting the data to logMAR [83]. The design of the 5SL chart follows the Weber-Fechner rule, which was thought could be directly used for VA statistics and efficacy evaluation, and be essentially equivalent to the logMAR recording method [84]. However, the agreement between 5SL and logMAR is not high, and the VA measured by the 5SL chart is slightly better than that by the logMAR vision chart [84, 85]. Thus, the different methods of recording visual outcomes may contribute to the heterogeneity of BCVA. In addition, the heterogeneity of BCVA decreased significantly when limiting the intervention to TCM alone, suggesting that the different types of intervention may also be a source of heterogeneity in BCVA outcomes.

In terms of recurrence rate, only one study included patients with chronic CSC, and the results showed no significant difference between the TCM and conventional treatment groups. However, the small sample size of the study greatly limited the certainty of this outcome. Similarly, when limiting the use of the logMAR method to document BCVA, it was found that herbal medicines did not suggest an improvement in BCVA, and this outcome remains limited by the insufficient number of studies and patients.

Our study had a comprehensive search strategy that included all the literature on herbal medicine-related treatments for CSC to the best of our knowledge. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the outcome of the meta-analysis was stable. Nonetheless, we have the following limitations: first, although we implemented an adequate and detailed search strategy, the possibility of publication bias cannot be ruled out, which means that some result values may be amplified, especially in the presence of selective reporting bias in some included studies. Second, the inclusion population of this study was all Chinese, which is restrictive for generalization to other populations. In addition, the therapeutic measures in the control group included in the study were mainly improvement of microcirculation, vitamin supplements, laser, and other therapeutic measures, of which there were fewer studies containing laser therapy and no studies involving PDT and anti-VEGF therapy, the effect of Chinese medicine in this population remains uncertain. Last, studies involving BCVA and CRT were at high risk of combined intervention bias (performance bias), inconsistency (high heterogeneity), and imprecision (small samples), limiting the quality of evidence. As a result, no evidence was highly definitive. According to the GRADE evaluation system, the quality of our evidence ranged from "moderate" to "very low" (Table 5).

High certainty: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.

Moderate certainty: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.

Low certainty: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Very low certainty: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

Explanations

Concerns about bias in the domains of allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment and selective reporting.

b. I-squared = 77%.

c. Very concerned about the number of studies and participants.

d. I-squared = 89%.

Overall, our findings suggest that herbal medicines do not increase the risk of CSC recurrence; rather, the combination of herbal medicines may play a role in decreasing the rate of CSC recurrence and improving BCVA and CRT in patients with CSC compared with conventional treatment.

Additional Editor Comments:

Abstract

1. Overall abstract should be rewritten. Use non-structured abstract.

2. Introduction should have more background regarding study importance or motive

3. Methods: Add more about inclusion criteria, used databases, PRISMA adherence, type of meta-analysis, etc

4. Define abbreviations written in it

Introduction

1. Add more information about treatment and prevention of the disease, and why TCM is used

2. Overall, it is still confusing, why only writing bad side of the intervention? Please add more information, especially it is commonly inferred that SR/MA is intended for searching potential treatment/favorable effect (which is also apparent in the authors’ abstract)

Methods

1. For inclusion criteria, write it as narrative (as the exclusion criteria)

2. How about treatment outside of TCM? Is it considered as exclusion criteria or not? Please elaborate more about it

3. “Case series reports” are misleading term, please correct it to case series or case reports

4. Add no full text as exclusion criteria

5. Databases with abbreviation should be written as long form in first occurrence

6. Data extraction: add what data the authors wanted to gather

7. Add initials of all reviewer, not just write one or two

8. Add citation for RevMan (RevMan 5.4.1 (Cochrane Collaboration)

9. Delete “according to the synthesis without the meta-analysis guideline.”

10. Describe reviewers’ credentials for GRADE (are they ophthalmologists, TCM practitioners, or what?)

11. Rewrite and recite all PRISMA (mandatory). The authors were using an outdated version of it (2009). Should use 2020 version.

Result

1. Add criteria about acute and chronic CSC (suggestion: locate in method, data extraction)

2. ROB was used to evaluate the risk of bias in 23 RCTs [10,11,18,20] � but this is only 4 studies?

3. I am not really sure about the association about “funding” that is mentioned in the result (suggestion: delete)

4. Where is GRADE? Not shown in the result

5. For publication bias, do the analysis (e.g. Egger test) to determine whether there is a true bias. If it stays, give more explanation about the possible source.

Discussion

1. Expand discussion section, mostly by giving more detailed explanation about why TCM is beneficial while CS is usually not. Add more substances that may be responsible for it (not only giving general mechanism).

General

1. Please recheck for grammar and typographic error (such as: backgroud)

2. The information is interesting. However, there are several inconsistencies that may hinder further processing of this manuscript.

5. Review Comments to the Author

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: 1. The authors should include name of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that used in this study, such as wolfberry, licorice etc

2. The authors should clarify the kind of the TCM

"Single TCM such as: wolfberry, etc or combination of the TCM such as: wolfberry + licorice etc"

3. The study is lack of information about the safety of the TCM which is the one of the objective in this study

4. The authors must provide an explanation regarding treatment with TCM + C and TCM alone to avoid data bias

Reviewer #2: Dear authors,

Stress and cortisol are well-established factors in the pathogenesis of CSC. A meta-analysis on the effects of Chinese traditional medicine with purported hormone-like effects is therefore a relevant and interesting topic. I hope my comments will be helpful to further improve the manuscript.

Page 5: In the data analysis section, there is a typographical error regarding CSC type. Chornic is greater than 6 months and acute should be less than 6 months. Also in the next line, ‘no treatment, et al’ seems to be an error.

Page 6: In literature search, please recheck the number of duplicate studies that were removed (995). A total of 1826 articles and 838 remaining, does not match with it. Also, the number of full text articles excluded (321) needs to be rechecked in figure 1.

Page 7: Please mention the hormone-like and non-hormone-like herbal medicines that were used in the included studies. Also what were the vitamins and retinal microcirculation-improving drugs?

Page 11: The mixed type CSC is mentioned. However, the definition is not included in the methods/data analysis. Does it mean CSC in combination with RPE detachments, neovascularization, etc?

Reviewer #3: Although a good review, the reviewer feels that it does not add anything new in the literature.

Maybe focusing on a selected TCMs and looking in depth at the effect of the selected TCMs might be more useful. As it stands it is too broad and unfocused.

Reviewer #4: This manuscript reported meta-analysis results about the efficacy and safety of treatments with Traditional Chinese medicine added in treating patients with Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). PRISMA guideline is followed. Subgroup analysis and many sensitivity analysis were performed for scientific rigor. However, there are some concerns:

1. It is unclear if all analysis had treated two eyes from the same patient as independent. For example, # of events and # of totals in Figure 2 and Figure 5 are on the patient-level or the eye-level? If those are on the eye-level, the calculation of corresponding OR should take into account the dependence of both eyes from the same patient. Similar concern for the estimation of mean differences exists.

2. It is unclear how standard mean difference is defined for BCVA where 18 studies used a standard visual acuity chart (decimal) and 2 used a logarithmic visual acuity chart (5-point scale). More details should be given.

3. It is recommended that the study team gets a professional biostatistician's help in result explanation. For example, the abstract says " it has no obvious side effects (OR=0.82, 95% CI:0.44,1.52; I2 = 30%)." which should be corrected because the quoted OR only suggested that TCM had no significantly different risk of side effect compared with the control group. Also it is claimed that "This study shows that the use of TCM does not cause the recurrence of CSC" which is not a rigorous statement.

4. Section 2.2.4 listed two primary outcomes. So it is recommended to report 97.5%CI for each primary outcome instead of 95% CIs.

Additional Editor Comments

Abstract

1. Overall abstract should be rewritten. Use a non-structured abstract.

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. As per your request, we have made changes to the abstract section. Please see the abstract section of the manuscript for details.

2. The introduction should have more background regarding the study's importance or motive.

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have supplemented the background of the study in the abstract.

3. Methods: Add more about inclusion criteria, used databases, PRISMA adherence, type of meta-analysis, etc.

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added a number of elements to the abstract regarding inclusion criteria, including the types of studies and populations involved, and the databases searched. Please see the abstract section of the manuscript for details.

4. Define abbreviations written in it.

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have made adjustments to the abbreviated content of the abstract accordingly.

Introduction

1. Add more information about the treatment and prevention of the disease, and why TCM is used.

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added more information about the treatment and prevention of CSC. In addition, we added the reasons and background for why TCM is used to treat CSC. Thank you for your comments.

2. Overall, it is still confusing, why only write the bad side of the intervention? Please add more information, especially it is commonly inferred that SR/MA is intended for searching potential treatment/favorable effects (which is also apparent in the authors’ abstract).

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. First, we learned that countries/regions other than China, such as Singapore, are particularly concerned about TCM as a risk factor for CSC. In order to determine whether TCM carries this potential risk, we conducted this meta-analysis. In fact, we wanted to observe the effect of TCM on CSC to see if it is beneficial or harmful to CSC. 

Considering your concerns, we have added the possible benefits of herbal medicine in the introduction section and described the purpose of the study at the end of the introduction.

Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.

Methods

1. For inclusion criteria, write it as narrative (as the exclusion criteria)

Response: We have re-written this part according to your suggestion.

2. How about treatment outside of TCM? Is it considered as exclusion criteria or not? Please elaborate more about it

Response: Thank you for your reminding. In our study, studies in the intervention group that combine TCM with treatment in the control group were included, while studies that combine treatment outside of TCM were excluded. We have added this in the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria section. Thank you for your comments.

3. “Case series reports” are misleading term, please correct it to case series or case reports

Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing, and we have re-written this part according to your suggestion.

4. Add no full text as exclusion criteria

Response: We have added it as exclusion criteria according to your suggestion.

5. Databases with abbreviation should be written as long form in first occurrence

Response: Thank you for your reminding. We have re-written this part according to your suggestion.

6. Data extraction: add what data the authors wanted to gather

Response: We have re-written this part according to the Reviewer’s suggestion.

7. Add initials of all reviewer, not just write one or two

Response: Thank you for your reminding. We have added initials of relevant reviewers according to your suggestion.

8. Add citation for RevMan (RevMan 5.4.1 (Cochrane Collaboration)

Response: Thank you for your reminding. We have added citation for RevMan in the beginning of “data analysis” part.

9. Delete “according to the synthesis without the meta-analysis guideline.”

Response: We have deleted this part according to your suggestion.

10. Describe reviewers’ credentials for GRADE (are they ophthalmologists, TCM practitioners, or what?)

Response: Thank you for your reminding. We have described the reviewers’ credentials for GRADE according to your suggestion.

11. Rewrite and recite all PRISMA (mandatory). The authors were using an outdated version of it (2009). Should use 2020 version.

Response: Thank you for your reminding. We have updated PRISM 2009 to PRISM 2000, please refer to S4 for details.

Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.

Result

1. Add criteria about acute and chronic CSC (suggestion: locate in method, data extraction)

Response: Thank you for your reminding. We have added criteria about acute and chronic CSC in the “data extraction” part.

2. ROB was used to evaluate the risk of bias in 23 RCTs [10,11,18,20] � but this is only 4 studies?

Response: We are very sorry for our negligence of this part. We have corrected it and thank you for your reminding.

3. I am not really sure about the association about “funding” that is mentioned in the result (suggestion: delete)

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have deleted it according to your suggestion.

4. Where is GRADE? Not shown in the result.

Response: The GRADE result is in the supplementary file. Considering that it is an overall evaluation of the evidence, we have described it in the final discussion section. We have adapted it to the body of the manuscript. Please refer to Table 5 for details. Thank you for your reminding.

5. For publication bias, do the analysis (e.g. Egger test) to determine whether there is a true bias. If it stays, give more explanation about the possible source.

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added Egger test for the evaluation of publication bias, and the result showed P=0.052, indicating no significant publication bias. Please refer to the publication Bias section for details. The diagram of egger detection is in supplementary material S3.

Discussion

1. Expand discussion section, mostly by giving more detailed explanation about why TCM is beneficial while CS is usually not. Add more substances that may be responsible for it (not only giving general mechanism).

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We added the relevant studies between glucocorticoids and CSC, and the possible mechanisms of glucocorticoid-induced CSC in the discussion section. In addition, we discuss in detail the possible mechanism of action of TCM in the treatment of CSC. Please see pages 18 and 19 of the Discussion section for specific details.

General

1. Please recheck for grammar and typographic error (such as: backgroud)

Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing. We carefully tested the whole text for spelling and grammar. Thank you for your reminder.

2. The information is interesting. However, there are several inconsistencies that may hinder further processing of this manuscript.

Response: Thank you very much for recognizing and commenting on our study.

We apologize for some of the inconsistencies in our manuscript. We will do our best to improve the manuscript, and We really appreciate for Editors warm work earnestly and hope that the correction will meet with approval.

Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.

Reviewer #1:

1. Response to comment: The authors should include name of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that used in this study, such as wolfberry, licorice etc.

Response: Thank you for your advice. We added the name of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) included in the study. For details, please refer to Table 1.

2.Response to comment: The authors should clarify the kind of the TCM.

Response: Thank you for your advice. We have clarified the herbal composition of the TCM treatment included in the study. Bolded herbal compositions indicate the presence of hormones or hormone-like effects. For details, please refer to Table 1.

3. Response to comment: The study is lack of information about the safety of the TCM which is the one of the objective in this study.

Response: Thank you for your comments. We evaluated the safety of TCM using side effects, as described in the meta-analysis section "Adverse events". However, side effects were described in only 6 studies in our results. We contacted the authors but did not receive a positive response. The available evidence suggests that there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the TCM group and conventional treatment group (OR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.39,1.34; I2 = 10%), regardless of whether the TCM contained hormonal components or not. (Fig 5).

4. Response to comment: The authors must provide an explanation regarding treatment with TCM + C and TCM alone to avoid data bias.

Response: Thank you for your comments! According to your suggestion, we analyzed the results of meta-analysis for TCM alone and TCM combination treatment (TCM+C) in subgroup analysis. The results showed that compared with conventional treatment, both TCM alone (TCM alone) and the combination of TCM (TCM+C) improved the indicators in terms of CSC recurrence rate, BCVA, and CRT. As for adverse events, compared with conventional treatment, neither TCM alone nor TCM+C showed significant differences. For details, please refer to Table 3. Special thanks to you for your good comments！

Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.

Reviewer #2:

1.Response to comment: Page 5: In the data analysis section, there is a typographical error regarding CSC type. Chornic is greater than 6 months and acute should be less than 6 months. Also in the next line, ‘no treatment, et al’ seems to be an error.

Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing, and we have re-written this part according to your suggestion.

2.Response to comment: Page 6: In literature search, please recheck the number of duplicate studies that were removed (995). A total of 1826 articles and 838 remaining, does not match with it. Also, the number of full text articles excluded (321) needs to be rechecked in figure 1.

Response: We are very sorry for our mistakes., and we have re-written this part. Please refer to Figure 1 for specific changes.

Thank you for pointing out these details of our mistakes, which will help us improve our manuscript.

3.Response to comment: Page 7: Please mention the hormone-like and non-hormone-like herbal medicines that were used in the included studies. Also what were the vitamins and retinal microcirculation-improving drugs?

Response: Thank you for your advice. We have added the herbal composition of the TCM treatment included in the study. Bolded herbal compositions indicate the presence of hormones or hormone-like effects. In addition, with reference to your comments, we provide a detailed description of the vitamins and retinal microcirculation-improving drugs in control group. For details, please refer to Table 1.

Thank you for your advice.

4.Response to comment: Page 11: The mixed type CSC is mentioned. However, the definition is not included in the methods/data analysis. Does it mean CSC in combination with RPE detachments, neovascularization, etc?

Response: Thank you for your comment, and we apologize for not describing this clearly. "Mixed type CSC" refers to a mixture of acute and chronic CSC patients, and did not include acute or chronic patients alone. Because we did not know the exact proportion of patients with acute and chronic CSC and were concerned about biasing the results, we performed separate subgroup analyses for this type of study, as shown in Table 3.

We labeled "mixed type CSC" for further clarification. Thank you for your comments.

Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.

Reviewer #3:

1. Response to comment: Maybe focusing on a selected TCMs and looking in depth at the effect of the selected TCMs might be more useful. As it stands it is too broad and unfocused.

Response: Thank you for your comments. Our aim in this literature is to explore the effects of herbal medicines on CSC as a whole. Hormones have been shown to be a risk factor for CSC, and some herbs are considered by many ophthalmologists to be a risk factor for recurrence in patients with CSC due to their hormonal components or hormone-like effects. Some ophthalmologists often ask patients with CSC recurrence whether they have taken herbal medicines, without limiting herbal treatment specifically to one herb.

In order to explore the effect of herbal medicines as a whole on CSC, we summarized all the available evidence related to the treatment of CSC with herbal medicines that we are aware of, in order to provide clinically relevant evidence for reference. In addition, we analyzed separately the herbal medicines containing hormones or hormone-like effects to further focus on the issue of herbal medicine use and CSC recurrence.

We hope that this study can show the impact of herbal medicines, especially hormone-like herbal medicines, on CSC with the widest number of studies and sample size, and patient population. Therefore, we chose such an overall search.

Thank you again for your professional opinion.

Reviewer #4:

1. Response to comment: It is unclear if all analysis had treated two eyes from the same patient as independent. For example, # of events and # of totals in Figure 2 and Figure 5 are on the patient-level or the eye-level? If those are on the eye-level, the calculation of corresponding OR should take into account the dependence of both eyes from the same patient. Similar concern for the estimation of mean differences exists.

Response: Thank you very much for your professional advice! We had previously based our calculations on the eye alone, both for the BCVA outcome in Figure 2 and the adverse event outcome in Figure 5. However, after your reminder, we noticed that the adverse reactions were not about the eyes, but for systemic adverse reactions, including nausea, gastrointestinal reactions, panic, and subcutaneous hemorrhage and hardening accompanied by subcutaneous injection of drugs.

Therefore, we recalculated the adverse events item and conduct
