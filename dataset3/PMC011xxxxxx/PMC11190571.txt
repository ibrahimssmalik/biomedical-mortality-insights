﻿Abstract

Two new species of Polyporales, Cerrenacaulinicystidiata and Polyporusminutissimus, are illustrated and described on the basis of morphological studies and phylogenetic analyses from southern China and Vietnam. C.caulinicystidiata is characterized by annual, resupinate, sometimes effused-reflexed basidiocarps, greyish orange to brownish orange pore surface, irregular pores (3–8 per mm), a trimitic hyphal system, pyriform to ventricose cystidia, and subglobose basidiospores 3.2–4.5 × 2.8–3.5 µm in size. P.minutissimus is characterized by annual, solitary, fan-shaped with a depressed center or infundibuliform basidiocarps, obvious black stipe, cream to buff yellow pileal surface with glabrous, occasionally zonate and radially aligned stripes, angular pores (6–9 per mm), a dimitic hyphal system, and cylindrical basidiospores, 5–9.2 × 2.2–4 μm. Detailed descriptions and illustrations of the two new species are provided. The differences between the two new species and their morphologically similar and phylogenetically related species are discussed.

The order Polyporales presents a great diversity of basidiocarp types and hymenophore configurations (Binder et al. 2013). It is an important group of fungi, as Polyporales species can cause wood-decay and thus play an essential role in the carbon cycle. In addition, some species of Polyporales may have medicinal properties (Dai 1996, 1999, 2012; Dai et al. 2009). The order has long been the subject of research on taxonomic diversity, distribution patterns, and ecological functions (Hibbett et al. 2014). As of early 2024, more than 1,800 species are recognized in the order (Martinez et al. 2004; Martinez et al. 2009; Kirk et al. 2008; Grigoriev et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2015; Justo et al. 2017). Due to its great diversity, the order is intensively studied worldwide (Justo et al. 2017).

Cerrena Gray is the type genus of Cerrenaceae within the Polyporales (Ryvarden and Gilbertson 1993; Justo et al. 2017), and it is typified by C.unicolor (Bull.) Murrill. It is widely distributed throughout the world. The genus is characterized by resupinate, effused-reflexed or pileate basidiocarps, irregular hymenophore, dimitic or trimitic hyphal systems, cylindric to ellipsoid basidiospores, and white rot (Ryvarden and Gilbertson 1993; Ryvarden et al. 2022). The genus Cerrena published in 1821 has priority above Trametes Fr., published in 1838, and the two genera were considered as a single taxon in several studies. Thus, a huge number of new combinations in Cerrena. (Cunningham and Cunningham1965; Gilbertson and Ryvarden 1987; Corner 1989; Ryvarden and Melo 2022). However, Ryvarden (1991) recommended to keep Cerrena as a separate genus based on their anatomical characters. According to Index Fungorum (http://www.indexfungorum.org) and Yuan (2014), Cerrena currently comprises around 10 species.

Polyporus P. Micheli ex Adans., the type genus of the Polyporaceae, is a well-known polypore genus (Gilbertson and Ryvarden 1987). Given that Micheli (1729) did not originally select a type species for Polyporus, there is no consensus on the selection of the type. Since Donk (1933) selected P.tuberaster (Jacq. ex Pers.) Fr. as the type species, this lectotype was accepted by most subsequent mycologists (Cunningham and Cunningham 1965; Singer 1986; Niemelä and Kotiranta 1991; Ryvarden 1991; Sotome et al. 2008; Ji et al. 2022). Morphologically, Polyporus is a heterogeneous genus including many species belonging to six morphological groups described by Núñez and Ryvarden (1995), viz, the Polyporus group, the Favolus group (= Favolus Fr.), the Melanopus group (= Melanopus Pat.), the Polyporellus group (= Polyporellus Karst.), the Admirabilis group, and the Dendropolyporus group (= Dendropolyporus (Pouz.) Jülich). Phylogenetically, Polyporus s. str. is known as a polyphyletic genus (Krüger et al. 2006; Sotome et al. 2008, 2011; Ji et al. 2022). Phylogenetic analyses of Polyporus did not conform to the six morphological groups, for which further in-depth study of the group is needed (Sotome et al. 2008; Zhou et al. 2016).

During investigations on wood-decaying polypores from South China and Vietnam, specimens that morphologically fit the definitions of Cerrena and Polyporus were collected. Phylogenetically, these samples formed two distinct lineages within Cerrena and Polyporus, respectively, and they are different from their morphologically similar and phylogenetically related species. Therefore, we describe and illustrate two new species, Cerrenacaulinicystidiata sp. nov. and Polyporusminutissimus sp. nov. within the Polyporales on the basis of morphological studies and phylogenetic analyses.

﻿Materials and methods

﻿Morphological studies

The studied specimens are deposited in the Fungarium of Beijing Forestry University (BJFC) and the Institute of Applied Ecology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IFP). Macro-morphological descriptions were based on field notes and voucher herbarium specimens. Microscopic measurements and drawings were made from slides prepared from voucher tissues and stained with Cotton Blue and Melzer’s reagent. The following abbreviations were used: KOH = 5% potassium hydroxide; CB = Cotton Blue; CB+ = cyanophilous in Cotton Blue; CB– = acyanophilous in Cotton Blue; IKI = Melzer’s; IKI– = neither amyloid nor dextrinoid in Melzer’s reagent; L = mean basidiospore length (arithmetic average of basidiospores); W = mean basidiospore width (arithmetic average of basidiospores); Q = variation in the L/W ratios between specimens studied; n (a/b) = number of basidiospores (a) measured from the given number of specimens (b). When we present basidiospore size variation, 5% of measurements were excluded from each end of the range. These excluded values are given in parentheses. Special color terms follow Anonymous (1969) and Petersen (1996).

﻿DNA extraction and sequencing

A CTAB rapid plant genome extraction kit (Aidlab Biotechnologies, Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was used to obtain DNA products from voucher specimens following the manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications (Wu et al. 2020, 2022). The following primer pairs were used to amplify the DNA: ITS5 and ITS4 for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (White et al. 1990) and LR0R and LR7 for the nuclear large subunit (nLSU) rDNA gene (Vilgalys and Hester 1990).

The procedures for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used in this study were the same as described by Wu et al. (2022). The PCR products were purified and sequenced by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), China. All newly generated sequences in this study were deposited in GenBank (Sayers et al.2024; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and listed in Table 1.

﻿Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees of Cerrena and Polyporus were constructed using the two concatenated ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-nLSU sequences dataset, respectively, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) methods. New sequences generated in this study and reference sequences retrieved from GenBank (Table 1) were partitioned to ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, nLSU and then aligned separately using MAFFT v.74 (Katoh et al. 2019; http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) with the G-INS-I iterative refinement algorithm and optimised manually in BioEdit v.7.0.5.3 (Hall 1999). The separate alignments were then concatenated using PhyloSuite v.1.2.2 (Zhang et al. 2020). Unreliably aligned sections were removed before the analyses, and efforts were made to manually inspect and improve the alignment. The data matrix was edited in Mesquite v3.70. Irpexlatemarginatus (Durieu & Mont.) C.C. Chen & Sheng H. Wu was used as an outgroup in the phylogenetic analysis of Cerrena (Parmasto and Hallenberg 2000). Trametesconchifer (Schwein.) Pilát, T.elegans (Spreng.) Fr. and T.polyzona (Pers.) Justo were selected as outgroups in the phylogenetic analysis of Polyporus (Ji et al. 2022). The final alignments and the retrieved topologies were deposited in TreeBASE (http://www.treebase.org) under accessions 31102, 31103.

RAxML 7.2.8 was used to infer ML trees for both datasets with the GTR+I+G model of site substitution, including estimation of Gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites (Stamatakis 2006). The branch support was evaluated with a bootstrapping method of 1,000 replicates (Hillis and Bull 1993).

For BI, the best-fit partitioning scheme and substitution model were determined by using ModelFinder (Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017) via the “greedy” algorithm, branch lengths estimated as “linked” and AICc. The BI was conducted with MrBayes 3.2.6 in two independent runs, each of which had four chains for 20 million generations and started from random trees (Ronquist et al. 2012). Trees were sampled every 1,000 generations. The first 25% of the sampled trees were discarded as burn-in and the remaining ones were used to reconstruct a majority rule consensus and calculate Bayesian Posterior Probabilities (BPP) of the clades.

Phylogenetic trees were visualized using FigTree version 1.4.4 (Rambaut 2018). Branches that received bootstrap support (BS) for ML and BPPs greater than or equal to 75% (ML) and 0.95 (BPP) were considered significantly supported, respectively.

﻿Results

﻿Phylogenetic analyses

In the phylogenetic analysis of Cerrena (Fig. 1), the combined ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-nLSU dataset included sequences from 50 fungal collections representing 11 taxa, and one sample of Irpexlatemarginatus was used as an outgroup. ModelFinder proposed models were HKY+F+G4 for ITS1, GTR+F+I+G4 for 5.8s, HKY+F+G4 for ITS2 and GTR+F+I for nLSU, for Bayesian analysis. The BI analysis resulted in an average standard deviation of split frequencies = 0.008865. As both ML and BI trees resulted in similar topologies, only the topology of the ML analysis is presented together with the statistical values of the ML (≥75%) and BPP (≥0.90) algorithms (Fig. 1). The phylogeny inferred from ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-nLSU sequences (Fig. 1) showed that our three newly sequenced samples together with three samples defined as Cerrena sp. 1 by Miettinen et al. (2023) formed an independent lineage with strong support (97/0.98, Fig. 1). The lineage is defined as the new species Cerrenacaulinicystidiata.

In the phylogenetic analysis of Polyporus (Fig. 2), the combined ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-nLSU dataset included sequences from 113 fungal collections representing 71 species, and three samples of Trametes were used as outgroups. ModelFinder suggested models were GTR+F+I+G4 for ITS1, K2P+I+G4 for 5.8s, K2P+I+G4 for ITS2 and GTR+F+I+G4 for nLSU, for Bayesian analysis. The BI analysis resulted in an average standard deviation of split frequencies = 0.009675. The ML and BI trees were similar in topology, and only the topology of the ML analysis is presented along with the statistical values of the ML (≥75%) and BPP (≥0.90) algorithms (Fig. 2). The phylogeny inferred from the combined ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-nLSU sequences (Fig. 2) revealed that a new lineage with high support (100/1.00,) nests in the squamosus clade in Polyporus, namely Polyporusminutissimus. The new species is closely related to P.hemicapnodes Berk. & Broome and P.parvovarius H. Lee, N.K. Kim & Y.W. Lim.

﻿Discussion

In this study, two new species of the Polyporales - Cerrenacaulinicystidiata and Polyporusminutissimus - are proposed based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence. Our three newly sequenced Cerrena samples together with three samples which were defined as Cerrena sp. 1 by Miettinen et al. (2023) formed an independent well-supported lineage in our phylogeny (Fig. 1). The lineage is proposed as the new species C.caulinicystidiata. Another lineage which is defined as Cerrena sp. 2 in our phylogeny is closely related to C.caulinicystidiata, but we didn’t collect one specimen within the lineage, so the lineage is considered to be Cerrena sp.

Cerrenacaulinicystidiata is characterized by its resupinate, sometimes effused-reflexed basidiocarps, greyish orange to brownish orange pore surface, 3–8 per mm pores, and subglobose basidiospores, 3.2–4.5 × 2.8–3.5 µm in size. C.albocinnamomea (Y.C. Dai & Niemelä) H.S. Yuan originally described from Northeast China resembles C.caulinicystidiata by sharing resupinate and easily separable basidiocarps. However, C.albocinnamomea differs from C.caulinicystidiata by its clavate to pyriform cystidia, slightly smaller ellipsoid basidiospores (2.8–3.5 × 2–3 µm vs. 3.2–4.5 × 2.8–3.5 µm), and a dimitic hyphal system (Yuan 2014).

In addition, Rigidoporusvinctus (Berk.) Ryvarden [≡ Physisporinusvinctus (Berk.) Murrill, Wu et al. 2017] resembles C.caulinicystidiata by having resupinate basidiocarps, ochraceous pore surface, ventricose cystidia with a subcylindric appendage, encrusted cystidia, and subglobose basidiospores, but it can be distinguished from the latter species by its smaller pores (6–12 per mm vs. 3–8 per mm) and generative hyphae with simple septa (Ryvarden and Johansen 1980).

The genus Cerrena is widely distributed and has diverse morphological characteristics. Currently, there are 13 records according to Index Fungorum (http://www.indexfungorum.org). However, C. ‘gilbertsonii’ Ryvarden cannot be distinguished from C.cystidiata Rajchenb. & De Meijer by morphological characteristics, and C. ‘multipileata’ (C.L. Leite & J.E. Wright) Miettinen cannot be distinguished from C.zonata (Berk.) H.S. Yuan (Miettinen et al. 2023). Cerrenaaurantiopora J.S. Lee & Y.W. Lim is a synonym of C.albocinnamomea (Lee and Lim 2010; Miettinen et al. 2023). Therefore, we provide a Key to 11 undisputed Cerrena species including the new species.

In the phylogenetic analysis of Polyporus, P.minutissimus was assigned to the squamosus clade with strong support (100/1.00, Fig. 2). The squamosus clade has always been supported by phylogenetic analysis based on the ITS+nLSU or eight-gene datasets, but the species within this clade cannot be combined into a monophyletic genus because they manifest greatly diverse morphology (Ji et al. 2022). Phylogenetically, P.minutissimus is closely related to P.hemicapnodes and P.parvovarius (Fig. 2). P.hemicapnodes was described from Dolosbagey (Sri Lanka). For some time, it was treated as a synonymy of P.leprieurii (Núñez and Ryvarden 1995), which differs from P.minutissimus by its larger basidiocarps (up to 10 cm vs. up to 1.5 cm), cream to tan pore surface, and longer stipe (up to 5 cm vs. up to 0.5 cm, Berkeley and Broome 1873). Polyporusparvovarius has microscopic features similar to P.minutissimus. However, P.parvovarius differs by its smaller basidiocarps (up to 0.35 cm vs. up to 1.5 cm) and light buff to brown pileal surface (Tibpromma et al. 2017).

Macro-morphologically, Polyporusminutissimus has a depressed center or infundibuliform basidiocarps and black stipe, cream to buff yellow pileal surface, and 6–9 per mm pores. Microscopically, it has a dimitic hyphal system, strongly branched skeleton-binding hyphae in both trama and context, and cylindrical basidiospores. Morphologically, P.lamelliporus B.K. Cui, Xing Ji & J.L. Zhou is similar to P.minutissimus by sharing depressed center or infundibuliform basidiocarps, cream to buff yellow pileal surface, and similar-sized basidiospores, but the former differs through its larger basidiocarps (up to 5.2 cm vs. up to 1.5 cm), longer stipe (1–3.5 cm vs. 0.3–0.5 cm), and larger pores (0.5–1 per mm vs. 6–9 per mm, Ji et al. 2022). In addition, Picipesbaishanzuensis J.L. Zhou & B.K. Cui, which is similar to P.minutissimus and shares infundibuliform basidiocarps and a black stipe, has also been reported from Baishanzu nature reserve, which is the type producing area of our new species. However, P.baishanzuensis differs from P.minutissimus by its larger basidiocarps (up to 5.5 cm vs. up to 1.5 cm) and smaller basidiospores (6.6–7.9 × 2.5–3.1 µm vs. 5–9.2 × 2.2–4 µm; Zhou et al. 2016).

Polyporus is a very complicated genus with more than 3000 records according to the Index Fungorum. However, studies on Polyporus species in China are gradually being carried out, with some Chinese species having been described in Cui et al. (2019) and Ji et al. (2022). Therefore, we provide a Key to Chinese Polyporus species including the new species.

Polyporales is a large group of Basidiomycota with diverse morphology and phylogeny. There have been over 577 taxonomic proposals in the Polyporales and 2,183 publications with the keyword ‘Polyporales’ over the past decade (Binder et al. 2013; Justo et al. 2017). However, the species in the order are still not sufficiently investigated in Asia, especially in the subtropics and tropics (Li et al. 2016; Hyde 2022). New DNA sequencing techniques have revolutionized fungal taxonomy and diversity, with multi-marker datasets. In the present study, two new polypore species, C.caulinicystidiata and P.minutissimus were found in subtropical regions, which enriches our understanding of the fungal diversity of the Polyporales in Asia.
