Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain.

Vitamin B6 is an important nutrient for optimal brain function, with deficiencies linked to impaired memory, learning and mood in various mental disorders. In older people, vitamin B6 deficiency is also associated with declining memory and dementia. Although this has been known for years, the precise role of vitamin B6 in these disorders and whether supplements can be used to treat or prevent them remained unclear.

This is partly because vitamin B6 is actually an umbrella term for a small number of very similar and interchangeable molecules. Only one of these is ‘bioactive’, meaning it has a biological role in cells. However, therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing only the bioactive form of vitamin B6 are lacking.

Previous work showed that disrupting the gene for an enzyme called pyridoxal phosphatase, which breaks down vitamin B6, improves memory and learning in mice. To investigate whether these effects could be mimicked by drug-like compounds, Brenner, Zink, Witzinger et al. used several biochemical and structural biology approaches to search for molecules that bind to and inhibit pyridoxal phosphatase.

The experiments showed that a molecule called 7,8-dihydroxyflavone – which was previously found to improve memory and learning in laboratory animals with brain disorders – binds to pyridoxal phosphatase and inhibits its activity. This led to increased bioactive vitamin B6 levels in mouse brain cells involved in memory and learning.

The findings of Brenner et al. suggest that inhibiting pyridoxal phosphatase to increase vitamin B6 levels in the brain could be used together with supplements. The identification of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone as a promising candidate drug is a first step in the discovery of more efficient pyridoxal phosphatase inhibitors. These will be useful experimental tools to directly study whether increasing the levels of bioactive vitamin B6 in the brain may help those with mental health conditions associated with impaired memory, learning and mood.

Vitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that plays an important role in the nervous system (Bowling, 2011; Wilson et al., 2019), with the vitamin B6 status affecting cognitive function at any age (di Salvo et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2014). Population studies indicate that low vitamin B6 levels are common among older people (Malouf and Grimley Evans, 2003), and suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency may influence memory performance and may contribute to age-related cognitive decline (Hughes et al., 2017; Jannusch et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2022; Elias et al., 2006). Vitamin B6 deficiency is also associated with other conditions characterized by impaired learning and memory, including neuropsychiatric disorders (Tomioka et al., 2018; Toriumi et al., 2021; Arai et al., 2010), Alzheimer’s disease (Paul, 2021), and inflammation (Ueland et al., 2017; Danielski et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies are often insufficiently understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear (Mitchell et al., 2014; Malouf and Grimley Evans, 2003; Wang et al., 2022b; Behrens et al., 2020; Hassel et al., 2019; Rutjes et al., 2018; Smith and Refsum, 2016; Aisen et al., 2008; Douaud et al., 2013).

The term vitamin B6 encompasses the enzymatically interconvertible compounds pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal (collectively referred to as B6 vitamers), and their phosphorylated forms. Among these, only pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is co-enzymatically active. In humans, PLP is known to be required for 44 distinct biochemical reactions, including the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of neurotransmitters, amino acids, lipids, and glucose. In addition, B6 vitamers display antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions (Percudani and Peracchi, 2003; Eliot and Kirsch, 2004; Percudani and Peracchi, 2009; Parra et al., 2018).

Cellular PLP availability in the brain depends on numerous factors, including the intestinal absorption of B6 vitamers, extracellular phosphatases, inter-organ transport and intracellular enzymes, and carriers/scavengers involved in PLP formation and homeostasis (Wilson et al., 2019). Specifically, intracellular PLP is formed by the pyridoxal kinase (PDXK)-catalyzed phosphorylation of pyridoxal, or the pyridox(am)ine-5’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO)-catalyzed oxidation of pyridox(am)ine 5’-phosphate to PLP. PLP is highly reactive and can undergo condensation reactions with, e.g., primary amino groups or thiol groups in proteins or amino acids. Although the mechanisms of PLP delivery within the cells are still largely unknown, it is clear that the intracellular availability of PLP for co-enzymatic functions depends on PLP carriers/scavengers and on the hydrolytic activity of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP) (Wilson et al., 2019; Ciapaite et al., 2023; Fux and Sieber, 2020; Jang et al., 2003; Jeanclos et al., 2019).

We have previously shown that the genetic knockout of PDXP (PDXP-KO) in mice increases brain PLP levels and improves spatial memory and learning, suggesting that elevated PLP levels can improve cognitive functions in this model (Jeanclos et al., 2019). We therefore reasoned that a pharmacological inhibition of PDXP may be leveraged to increase intracellular PLP levels and conducted a high-throughput screening campaign to identify small-molecule PDXP modulators. Here, we report the discovery and the structural and cellular validation of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a preferential PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models characterized by impaired cognition, and widely regarded as a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mimetic activity (Liu et al., 2016). However, a direct TrkB agonistic activity of 7,8-DHF has been called into question (Wang et al., 2022a; Boltaev et al., 2017; Pankiewicz et al., 2021; Todd et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2011). Our serendipitous discovery of 7,8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for 7,8-DHF-mediated effects. More potent, efficacious, and selective PDXP inhibitors may be useful future tools to explore a possible benefit of elevated PLP levels in brain disorders.

Results

PDXP activity controls PLP levels in the hippocampus

The hippocampus is important for age-dependent memory consolidation and learning, and impaired memory and learning is associated with PLP deficiency (di Salvo et al., 2012). To study a possible contribution of PDXP and/or PDXK to age-related PLP homeostasis in the hippocampus, we performed western blot analyses in young versus older mice. Unexpectedly, we found that both PDXP and PDXK expression levels were markedly higher in hippocampi of middle-aged than of juvenile animals (Figure 1a). These data suggest an accelerated hippocampal PLP turnover in older mice, consistent with previous findings in senescent mice (Fonda et al., 1980).

Bold table entries indicate those hippocampal extracts that were further separated for an analysis of protein-depleted and protein-bound PLP (see Figure 1c). Source data are available for this table.

An analysis of total hippocampal PLP levels in PDXP-WT and PDXP-KO mice showed an age-dependent profile. PLP levels appeared to peak around 3 months of age (possibly reflecting PLP-dependent neurotransmitter biosynthesis and metabolism during the postnatal developmental period) and descended back to juvenile levels by 12 months of age in both genotypes. Although total hippocampal PLP levels in PDXP-KO mice also decreased with age, they consistently remained above PLP levels in control mice (Figure 1b; two-tailed, unpaired t-test of PLP levels in PDXP-WT vs. PDXP-KO hippocampi, all ages combined: p<0.0001).

PLP is protected from hydrolysis by binding to proteins, and PDXP is expected to dephosphorylate only non-protein-bound PLP (Gohla, 2019). To test this, we prepared protein-depleted PLP fractions from PDXP-WT and PDXP-KO hippocampal lysates using 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifugal filters. The quantification of PLP in these fractions demonstrated that PDXP loss indeed only increased the pool of protein-depleted PLP, both in young (18–42 days of age) and in older mice (252–352 days of age, corresponding to mature/middle-aged mice), whereas the levels of protein-bound PLP remained unchanged (Figure 1c). While the hippocampal levels of non-protein-bound PLP dropped by about 60% over this time span in PDXP-WT mice, they remained elevated in PDXP-KO mice (~2-fold higher in younger, and ~5-fold higher in older PDXP-KO compared to the respective PDXP-WT; see Figure 1—source data 3 for exact mouse ages). We conclude that hippocampi of older mice are characterized by a specific decrease in the levels of non-protein-bound PLP, and that this age-dependent PLP loss is dependent on PDXP activity. These observations establish that PDXP is a critical determinant of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus and suggest that intracellular PLP deficiency may be alleviated by PDXP inhibition.

A high-throughput screening campaign identifies 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor

Pharmacological small-molecule PDXP inhibitors are currently lacking. To identify PDXP inhibitor candidates, we screened the FMP small-molecule repository containing 41,182 compounds for molecules able to modulate the phosphatase activity of recombinant, highly purified murine PDXP (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for a schematic of the screening campaign). Difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) was used as a fluorogenic phosphatase substrate in a primary screen. Compounds that altered DiFMUP fluorescence by ≥50% (activator candidates) or ≤25% (inhibitor candidates) were subjected to EC50/IC50 value determinations. Of these, 46 inhibitor hits were selected and counter-screened against phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP), the closest PDXP relative (Seifried et al., 2014; Jeanclos et al., 2022). Eleven of the PDXP inhibitor hits (with an IC50 PDXP < 20 µM, and IC50 PDXP < IC50 PGP or no activity against PGP) were subsequently validated in a secondary assay, using PLP as a physiological PDXP substrate (see Figure 2—source data 5 for all 11 inhibitor hits). Only one PDXP-selective inhibitor hit (7,8-DHF, a naturally occurring flavone) blocked PDXP-catalyzed PLP dephosphorylation (IC50 ~ 1 µM).

In vitro activity assays using PLP as a substrate confirmed that 7,8-DHF directly blocks murine and human PDXP activity with submicromolar potency and an apparent efficacy of ~50% (Figure 2a and b). We next examined whether commercially available 7,8-DHF analogs might be more potent or efficacious PDXP inhibitors. We tested flavone, 3,7-dihydroxyflavone, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (also known as chrysin), 3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone (galangin), 5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone (baicalein), and 3,7,8,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone. Figure 2b shows that of the tested 7,8-DHF analogs, only 3,7,8,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone was able to inhibit PDXP, albeit with an IC50 of 2.5 µM and thus slightly less potently than 7,8-DHF. These results suggest that hydroxyl groups in positions 7 and 8 of the flavone scaffold are required for PDXP inhibition. The efficacy of PDXP inhibition by 3,7,8,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone was not substantially increased at concentrations >40 µM (relative PDXP activity at 40 µM: 0.46±0.05; at 70 µM: 0.38±0.15; at 100 µM: 0.37±0.09; data are mean values ± SD of n=6 experiments). Concentrations >100 µM could not be assessed due to impaired PDXP activity at the DMSO concentrations required for solubilizing the flavone.

Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Identification of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP) inhibitors.

A primary screen was conducted using 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) as an artificial substrate. Out of 41,182 screened compounds, 256 compounds were discarded that showed very high autofluorescence (as recognized by elevated fluorescence at the start of the kinetic curve); 26 compounds showed statistically significant PDXP activation, and 255 compounds showed PDXP inhibition (as recognized by an elevated or decreased slope of the kinetic curve, respectively). The average Z’-factor of the screen was 0.75±0.112. These 281 compounds were selected for DiFMUP-based concentration-dependent validation, and the 46 most potent compounds were selected. A counter-screening was conducted in parallel, also in a concentration-dependent fashion, against the PDXP paralog and closest relative phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP). The 11 compounds that were inactive against PGP were validated in a secondary assay, using the PDXP substrate pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). One PDXP inhibitor hit blocked PLP dephosphorylation by ≥50%. Source data are available for this figure.

Sensorgrams of three additional experiments overlayed with the global 1:1 binding model (red) and the negative control (gray). The dashed line indicates the start of the dissociation phase. Source data are available for this figure.

We used a biolayer interferometry (BLI) optical biosensing technique to further characterize the binding of 7,8-DHF to PDXP (Figure 2c). Consistent with a specific interaction, 7,8-DHF binding to PDXP was concentration-dependent and fully reversible. As a result of the poor solubility of the molecule, a saturation of the binding site was not experimentally accessible. Steady-state analysis of a 7,8-DHF serial dilution series yielded an affinity (KD) value of 3.1±0.3 µM (data are mean values ± SE of n=4 measurements; see Figure 2—figure supplement 2 for the three other measurements) using a 1:1 dose-response model. Global analysis of the sensorgrams assuming a 1:1 binding model resulted in an affinity of 2.6±0.5 µM, in line with the steady-state results (Figure 2c). As expected, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone showed no signal in the BLI, in line with previous experiments (see Figure 2b). With its molecular size of 254 Da and its physicochemical properties, 7,8-DHF is a typical fragment-like molecule (Congreve et al., 2003). Typical association rate constants (kon) for fragments are limited by the rate of diffusion and are higher than 106·M−1 s−1. Interestingly, 7,8-DHF showed a slow kon of 1.05·104 M−1 s−1, which is atypical and rarely found for fragment-like molecules (O’Connell et al., 2019), and a koff rate of 0.03 s−1. With the commonly used estimation of ΔG~pKD and a heavy atom number of 19, 7,8-DHF shows a high ligand efficiency of 0.39, which makes it an interesting molecule for further medicinal chemistry optimization. Taken together, these data support a direct and reversible physical interaction between 7,8-DHF and PDXP that leads to PDXP inhibition.

Selectivity of 7,8-DHF

PDXP is a member of the large family of haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-type hydrolases (Seifried et al., 2013). HAD phosphatases are Mg2+-dependent phospho-aspartate transferases that consist of a Rossman-like catalytic core linked to a cap domain. The insertion site, structure, and size of the cap define the substrate selectivity of the respective enzyme. The ‘capless’ C0-type HAD phosphatases contain either a very small or no cap, resulting in an accessible catalytic cleft that enables the dephosphorylation of macromolecular substrates. Larger C1 or C2 caps act as a roof for the entrance to the active site; most C1/C2-capped HAD phosphatases consequently dephosphorylate small molecules that can gain access to the catalytic cleft. Cap domains also contain the so-called substrate specificity loops that contribute to substrate coordination. Hence, caps are distinguishing features of HAD phosphatases (Gohla, 2019; Seifried et al., 2013; Burroughs et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2015).

To probe the selectivity of 7,8-DHF for PDXP, a C2-capped HAD phosphatase, we tested eight other mammalian HAD phosphatases, including two other C2-, four C1-, and two C0-type enzymes. In addition, we analyzed the activity of 7,8-DHF toward the prototypical tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B (which is known to be sensitive to specific flavonoids, Proença et al., 2018); the serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin (PP2B); and a DNA/RNA-directed alkaline phosphatase (calf intestinal phosphatase [CIP]) (Figure 2d). When assayed at nominal concentrations of 5, 10, and 40 µM (i.e. up to ~40-fold above the IC50 value for PDXP-catalyzed PLP dephosphorylation), 7,8-DHF was completely inactive against six of the tested enzymes. At the highest tested concentration of 40 µM, 7,8-DHF weakly inhibited PTP1B and the polynucleotide kinase-3'-phosphatase PNKP and appeared to increase the activity of calcineurin. As expected, 7,8-DHF inhibited PGP, the closest PDXP relative, with an IC50 value of 4.8 µM. This result is consistent with the criteria applied during the initial counter-screen (see above). In addition to PGP, 7,8-DHF inhibited the C1-capped soluble cytosolic 5’-nucleotidase 1A (NT5C1A) with an IC50 value of ~10 µM. NT5C1A is an AMP hydrolase expressed in skeletal muscle and heart (Bianchi and Spychala, 2003), which is also sensitive to inhibition by small molecules that target the closest PDXP-relative PGP (Jeanclos et al., 2022). Together, the selectivity analysis of 7,8-DHF on a total of 12 structurally and functionally diverse protein- and non-protein-directed phosphatases show that 7,8-DHF preferentially inhibits PDXP, and that higher 7,8-DHF concentrations can also target the PDXP paralog PGP and the nucleotidase NT5C1A.

Mode of PDXP inhibition

To probe the mechanism of PDXP inhibition, we assayed the steady-state kinetics of PLP dephosphorylation in the presence of increasing 7,8-DHF concentrations (Table 1). Analysis of the derived kinetic constants demonstrated that 7,8-DHF increased the KM up to ~2-fold, and slightly reduced vmax values ~0.7-fold. Thus, 7,8-DHF mainly exhibits a mixed mode of PDXP inhibition, which is predominantly competitive.

Co-crystal structures of PDXP bound to 7,8-DHF

To investigate the mechanism of PDXP inhibition in more detail, we co-crystallized homodimeric, full-length murine and human PDXP (mPDXP, hPDXP) with this compound. 7,8-DHF-bound murine PDXP co-crystallized with phosphate in the cubic space group I23, with protomer A containing the inhibitor and protomer B representing an inhibitor-free state (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a). The structure was refined following molecular replacement with full-length murine PDXP (here referred to as apo-mPDXP; Protein Data Bank/PDB entry 4BX3) to a resolution of 2.0 Å resulting in an Rwork of 18.4% and an Rfree of 21.1% (PDB code 8QFW). We additionally obtained two co-crystal structures of human PDXP with 7,8-DHF: one in a phosphate-containing and one in a phosphate-free form. Both forms crystallized in the tetragonal space group P43212, and each protomer of both structures contained the inhibitor (Figure 3a). These structures were refined following molecular replacement with full-length human PDXP (PDB entry 2P27, here referred to as apo-hPDXP) to a resolution of 1.5 Å resulting in an Rwork/Rfree of 17.0/19.4% (phosphate-bound 7,8-DHF-hPDXP, PDB code 9EM1), and to a resolution of 1.5 Å resulting in an Rwork/Rfree of 18.2/20.5% (phosphate-free 7,8-DHF-hPDXP, PDB code 8S8A). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2.

Like their respective apo-forms, 7,8-DHF-bound murine and human PDXP homodimerize via their cap domains (Figure 3a and Figure 3—figure supplement 1a). The Cα atom-based alignment of the structures representing murine apo-PDXP and murine 7,8-DHF-bound PDXP resulted in root mean square (RMS) deviations in the range of 0.43–0.71 Å. Even smaller values were obtained when human apo-PDXP, human PLP-bound PDXP, and human 7,8-DHF-bound PDXP were superimposed with RMS deviations in the range from 0.29 to 0.54 Å (Table 3). Hence, binding of the inhibitor did not result in significant changes in murine or human PDXP backbone conformations. All catalytic core residues and the Mg2+ cofactor are correctly oriented in the presence of the inhibitor. We conclude that 7,8-DHF binding does not appear to impact the overall fold of murine or human PDXP.

Root mean square deviations are indicated.

7,8-DHF was observed to only bind to one subunit (the A-chain) of murine PDXP (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a) with well-defined density (Figure 3—figure supplement 1b) and full occupancy since its average B-factor of 45.8 Å2 closely matches the B-factors of the surrounding atoms. Binding to the other subunit (B-protomer) is prevented by a salt bridge between Arg62 and Asp14 of a symmetry-related A-protomer in the crystal (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c). The χ1 and χ2 torsion angles of the Arg62 side chain observed in the B-protomer correspond to those observed for this side chain in both protomers of the murine apo-structure (4BX3). To allow binding of the inhibitor, the side chain of Arg62 needs to adopt a completely extended conformation, which is prevented by the salt bridge. However, preventing mPDXP salt bridge formation by mutating Asp14 to Ala did not alter the efficacy of 7,8-DHF inhibition (Figure 3—figure supplement 1d; see also Figure 3d for the characterization of the PDXP-Arg62Ala variant). It is therefore currently unclear whether the mPDXP crystal state with only a single inhibitor bound per dimer reflects the state in solution. Due to the limited solubility of 7,8-DHF, we were unable to address the stoichiometry of 7,8-DHF binding to the PDXP dimer with isothermal calorimetry. It is conceivable that the mPDXP crystal packing is very stable (indeed, 7,8-DHF-bound mPDXP crystallized in the same cubic space group as apo-mPDXP, see Kestler et al., 2014, including the aforementioned salt bridge between Arg62 of the B-subunit and Asp14 of a symmetry-related molecule), and that the free energy generated by the formation of the crystal lattice is higher than the free energy generated upon inhibitor binding.

In contrast to murine PDXP, 7,8-DHF bound to human PDXP with a ratio of two inhibitors per homodimer (Figure 3a) and well-defined density (Figure 3—figure supplement 2a). Interestingly, the orientation of the inhibitor was markedly affected by the presence or absence of phosphate (Figure 3b). In the presence of phosphate, the inhibitor moiety that is closest to the Mg2+ cofactor is the uncharged phenyl ring of 7,8-DHF. In the absence of phosphate, the inhibitor is flipped horizontally, with the hydroxylated chromone substructure of 7,8-DHF now located closest to the Mg2+ ion (Figure 3b, compare left and right panels). The inhibitor localization in the presence of phosphate was identical in human and murine PDXP (Figure 3—figure supplement 2e). The localization of the phosphate ion that co-crystallized with 7,8-DHF-bound human or murine PDXP overlaps exactly with the localization of the PLP phosphate moiety introduced from PDB code 2CFT (human PDXP in complex with PLP) for visualization purposes (Figure 3c and Figure 3—figure supplement 2b), indicating that the phosphate ion is bound in a catalytically relevant position.

Irrespective of the orientation of 7,8-DHF in the PDXP active site, the inhibitor is embedded in a cavity that is exclusively formed by the active site of protomer A, without a contribution of the dimerization interface with protomer B. All PDXP residues found to engage in 7,8-DHF interactions are identical in murine and human PDXP (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). One side of this cavity is formed by the more polar residues Asp27, Asn60, Ser61, and Arg62 (identical amino acid residue numbering in mPDXP and hPDXP), whereas the opposite side is established by the more hydrophobic residues Tyr150, His182, Pro183, and Leu184 (corresponding to Tyr146, His178, Pro179, and Leu180 in mPDXP). Adjacent to this hydrophobic stretch, the polar residue Glu152 (Glu148 in mPDXP) is located at the active site entrance, directly opposite of Arg62 on the more polar side of the 7,8-DHF binding channel (Figure 3b and Figure 3—figure supplement 1e).

Interestingly, Glu152 (or Glu148) and Arg62 can form an intramolecular salt bridge that obstructs the active site entrance (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). This interaction was observed in phosphate-free 7,8-DHF-hPDXP and phosphate-free PLP-hPDXP, as well as in apo-hPDXP and apo-mPDXP. In contrast, the 7,8-DHF binding pose that is dictated by the concomitant binding of phosphate and 7,8-DHF interferes with the Glu152 (Glu148)-Arg62 interaction in both, hPDXP and mPDXP (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Thus, although we did not find evidence for major cap/core or substrate specificity loop movements (Jeanclos et al., 2022; Kestler et al., 2014) in PDXP, the presence or absence of a salt bridge formed between the cap domain residue Glu152 (Glu148) and the core domain residue Arg62 indicates subtle conformational changes in PDXP that may mediate an opening or a closure of the active site entrance.

Inhibitor binding in the presence of phosphate is identical in human and murine PDXP (Figure 3—figure supplement 1f) and appears to be primarily stabilized by two hydrogen bonds, as well as polar and non-polar interactions (Figure 3b, left panel). The side chain hydroxyl group of Ser61 forms a direct hydrogen bond with the ketone group of the inhibitor, which is additionally coordinated by the Ser61 backbone nitrogen atom. Furthermore, Glu152 (Glu148) forms a direct hydrogen bond via its carboxylic acid with the 7-hydroxyl group of 7,8-DHF. The side chains of the polar residues Asp27, Asn60, and Arg62 engage in van der Waals interactions with 7,8-DHF. The two hydroxyl groups of the 7,8-DHF benzyl ring engage in van der Waals interactions with the guanidinium group of Arg62 and the carboxylic acid function of Glu148 (Glu152). On the more hydrophobic side of the binding cavity, Tyr146 (Tyr150) forms π-electron stacking interactions with the pyrone ring of 7,8-DHF. In addition, the His178 (His182) imidazole group coordinates the 7,8-DHF phenyl ring via a cation-π interaction. His178 (His182), located in the substrate specificity loop, and Asn60 and Arg62 are also important for PLP binding (Kestler et al., 2014; Knobloch et al., 2015).

Inhibitor binding in the absence of phosphate is primarily stabilized by metal coordination and hydrogen bonds, as well as polar and non-polar interactions (Figure 3b, right panel). The 7-hydroxyl group of 7,8-DHF is involved in an octahedral Mg2+ coordination, albeit with an elongated oxygen-Mg2+ distance of 2.7 Å, leading to the displacement of a water molecule (Figure 3c). This inhibitor-based water displacement is not observed in the phosphate-containing murine or human 7,8-DHF-PDXP structures. The 8-hydroxyl group of 7,8-DHF forms a hydrogen bond with Arg239 and His182. The ketone group of the inhibitor participates in a water-bridged hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group of Asp27 and the backbone amine group of Gly33. Like in the phosphate-containing structure, the His182 imidazole group coordinates the 7,8-DHF phenyl ring via π-π stacking. In addition, Tyr150 forms edge to face π-π stacking interactions with the phenyl ring of 7,8-DHF. The side chains of the polar residues Asp27, Asn60, and, to some degree, also of Arg62, engage in van der Waals interactions with 7,8-DHF.

To verify the putative 7,8-DHF-PDXP interactions, we introduced single mutations into the binding interface. Asn60, Arg62, Tyr146, Glu148, and His178 in mPDXP were each exchanged for Ala (PDXPN60A, PDXPR62A, PDXPY146A, PDXPE148A, or PDXPH178A, respectively). Since the carboxamide group of Asn60 can form a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate moiety of Asp27, and a loss of this interaction in the PDXPN60A variant is predicted to alter the PDXP structure, we additionally mutated Asn60 to Ser (PDXPN60S). PDXP variants were recombinantly expressed and purified from Eschericha coli (see Figure 3—figure supplement 5 for protein purity). Figure 3d (left panel) shows that all PDXP variants were enzymatically active. As expected, the phosphatase activities of PDXPN60A and of PDXPH178A were reduced. The somewhat elevated phosphatase activity of PDXPY146A and PDXPE148A is currently unexplained. Importantly, all variants except PDXPN60A and PDXPN60S were resistant to 7,8-DHF, supporting the essential role of each of these residues for inhibitor binding and the minor contribution of the weak van der Waals interactions between Asn60 and 7,8-DHF during inhibitor binding (Figure 3d, right panel). These data also suggest that Asn61 contributes to the limited efficacy of 7,8-mediated PDXP inhibition in vitro.

Based on the inhibitor-bound structures and the predominantly competitive component of PDXP inhibition by 7,8-DHF (increased KM, see Table 1), it seems likely that 7,8-DHF sterically hinders substrate access to the active site, and competes with PLP coordination (Figure 3—figure supplement 2b). In addition, BLI measurements (see Figure 2c) showed a relatively slow association rate and extended residence time of 7,8-DHF (τ=30.3 s). This may indicate a reorganization of the Mg2+ coordination due to inhibitor binding, and a reorientation of 7,8-DHF during the PDXP catalytic cycle. The reduced rate of product formation may account for the apparent mixed mode of 7,8-DHF-mediated PDXP inhibition (reduction of vmax, see Table 1).

7,8-DHF functions as a PDXP inhibitor in hippocampal neurons

To investigate cellular target engagement of 7,8-DHF, we isolated primary hippocampal neurons from PDXP-WT and PDXP-KO embryos. PDXP deficiency increased total PLP levels 2.4-fold compared to PDXP-WT neurons (Figure 4a). This finding is in good agreement with the PLP increase resulting from PDXP loss in total hippocampal extracts (see Figure 1). The larger absolute PLP values in cultured neurons are likely attributable to the high concentration of the PLP precursor pyridoxal (20 µM) in the culture medium. We did not observe PDXP-dependent changes in PDXK expression (Figure 4b) and could not detect PNPO in hippocampal neuronal cultures, suggesting that the PLP increase was primarily caused by the constitutive PDXP loss.

To assess the consequences of 7,8-DHF treatment on PLP levels in hippocampal neurons, we chose short-term incubation conditions (45 min, 20 µM) to avoid possible secondary effects of the inhibitor. As expected, the acute effect of 7,8-DHF treatment in WT cells was much more subtle (∼9% increase in total PLP) than the impact of long-term PDXP deficiency (441.3±62.6 nmol PLP/g protein in DMSO solvent control-treated cells versus 482.7±130.4 nmol PLP/g protein in 7,8-DHF-treated cells; data are mean values ± SE of n=4 independent experiments). However, this effect is likely underestimated because only the PDXP-accessible pool of non-protein-bound PLP may be impacted by 7,8-DHF (see Figure 1c). Due to the limited number of available hippocampal neurons, we were unfortunately unable to obtain sufficient quantities of protein-depleted PLP pools to address this question.

Acute changes in the PLP/PL ratio may be a more sensitive indicator of PDXP activity than changes in total PLP levels alone, because PDXP inhibition is expected to increase cellular levels of PLP (the PDXP substrate) and to concomitantly decrease the levels of PL (the product of PDXP phosphatase activity). The PLP/PL ratio is also independent of the exact protein concentration in a given extract of hippocampal neurons, thus optimizing comparability between samples. As shown in Figure 4, 7,8-DHF significantly increased the PLP/PL ratio in PDXP-WT, but not in PDXP-KO hippocampal neurons (+18% versus +1% compared to the respective DMSO controls). Together, these data indicate that 7,8-DHF can modulate cellular PLP levels in a PDXP-dependent manner and validate PDXP as a 7,8-DHF target in primary hippocampal neurons.

Discussion

PLP deficiency has been associated with human brain disorders for decades (di Salvo et al., 2012), yet causal links remain unclear. Aside from vitamin B6 administration, pharmacological strategies to elevate intracellular PLP levels are lacking. Here, we identify 7,8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor that increases PLP levels in hippocampal neurons, validating PDXP as a druggable target to control intracellular PLP levels in the brain. We also present three high-resolution 7,8-DHF/PDXP co-crystal structures that will facilitate the design of more potent, efficacious, and selective PDXP inhibitors in the future. Such molecules might improve the control of intracellular PLP levels and help to elucidate a possible contribution of PLP to the pathophysiology of brain disorders. Our observation that the expression of PDXP is substantially upregulated in hippocampi of middle-aged mice suggests that a therapeutic vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not suffice to elevate intracellular PLP levels under conditions where the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive.

The discovery of 7,8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor was unexpected. Interestingly, numerous in vivo studies have reported the effectiveness of 7,8-DHF in brain disorder models, including rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease (Zhang et al., 2014a; Devi and Ohno, 2012; Bollen et al., 2013; Castello et al., 2014; Aytan et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2016; Akhtar et al., 2021; Hsiao et al., 2014), depression (Blugeot et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2014b; Yao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2022; Amin et al., 2020), schizophrenia (Jaehne et al., 2021; Han et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2014; Han et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2013), epilepsy (Becker et al., 2015; Guarino et al., 2022), and autism (Johnson et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2017; Lee and Han, 2019; Chen et al., 2023). Although PLP deficiency is thought to contribute to the respective human conditions (di Salvo et al., 2012; Majewski et al., 2016; Sorolla et al., 2016), PLP-dependent processes have not yet been considered in the context of 7,8-DHF-induced effects.

7,8-DHF was initially discovered as a small-molecule TrkB agonist with BDNF-mimetic activity (Jang et al., 2010). BDNF, a high-affinity TrkB ligand, is an important neuropeptide for nervous system function and pathology. Consensus is emerging that BDNF plays a key role in the treatment response to neuropsychiatric drugs (Wang et al., 2022a). Therapeutics that target BDNF/TrkB signaling are thus of interest as disease-modifying agents in several brain disorders. Since BDNF does not cross the blood-brain barrier, attempts have been made to develop small-molecule BDNF mimetics. Several candidates have been reported, including 7,8-DHF (Boltaev et al., 2017; Jang et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the on-target selectivity and efficacy of these compounds is actively debated. Using quantitative and direct assays to measure TrkB dimerization and activation, TrkB downstream signaling pathways, TrkB-dependent gene expression and cytoprotection, 7,8-DHF and other reported small-molecule TrkB agonists failed to activate TrkB in cells (Boltaev et al., 2017; Pankiewicz et al., 2021; Todd et al., 2014). An electrophysiological study in acute hippocampal slice preparations demonstrated that 7,8-DHF potentiates hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission in a TrkB receptor‐independent manner (Kobayashi and Suzuki, 2018). Overall, it appears that the mechanism of action of 7,8-DHF is incompletely understood, but 7,8-DHF targets other than TrkB so far have remained elusive. The identification of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor reported here indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders.

Materials

Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were of the highest available purity and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Schnelldorf, Germany). 3,7,8,4’-Tetrahydroxyflavone was obtained from Ambinter (Orléans, France), all other flavones were from Sigma-Aldrich.

PDXP knockout mice

Floxed PDXP mice (Pdxptm1Goh) were generated on a C57Bl/6J background, and whole-body Pdxp knockouts were achieved by breeding with B6.FVB-Tg(EIIa-cre)C5379Lmgd/J (EIIa-Cre) transgenic mice, as described (Jeanclos et al., 2019). All experiments were authorized by the local veterinary authority and committee on the ethics of animal experiments (Regierung von Unterfranken). All analyses were carried out in strict accordance with all German and European Union applicable laws and regulations concerning care and use of laboratory animals.

Preparation of hippocampi and hippocampal neurons and immunocytochemistry

Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and brains were immediately placed on a pre-cooled metal plate and dissected under a Leica M80 binocular (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Hippocampi were weighed and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The entire procedure was performed in <3 min. Hippocampal lysates were prepared by the addition of ice-cold PBS (200 µL PBS/10 mg hippocampal wet weight) and homogenized for 1 min in a TissueLyser II instrument (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). One fourth of the obtained volume of each lysate was used for the analysis of total PLP concentrations as described below. To determine protein-depleted PLP (Ciapaite et al., 2023), the remaining volume of each lysate was centrifuged at 14,000×g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was applied to 3 kDa MWCO filters (Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and centrifuged at 14,000×g for 45 min at 4°C. The flow-through was collected and prepared for HPLC analysis (see below).

Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from mouse embryos at embryonic day 17. Hippocampi were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL trypsin, 0.2 mg/mL EDTA, and 10 µg/mL DNase I in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. Trypsinization was stopped by adding 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were dissociated by trituration, counted, and seeded at a density of 150,000 cells per 35 mm dish. Dissociated cells were grown in neurobasal medium supplemented with L-glutamine and B27 supplement (A3582801, Life Technologies, Dreieich, Germany) with an exchange of 50% of the medium after 6 days in culture. After 21 days of differentiation (day in vitro 21 [DIV21]), 7,8-DHF (20 µM) or DMSO (0.02%, vol/vol) was added to the hippocampal neuronal cultures for 45 min. Cells were rinsed once with PBS (37°C), lysed in 150 µL ice-cold H2O, and placed at –80°C for at least 30 min.

For immunocytochemistry, DIV21 primary hippocampal neurons were fixed with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). After washing twice with PBS, 50 mM NH4Cl was added for 10 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% (vol/vol) goat serum in PBS for 30 min at 22°C. Cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibodies (1:500 dilution, clone AP20, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 hr in 5% goat serum/PBS at 22°C. Alexa488-labeled secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:500 dilution; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were applied for 1 hr. Nuclei were counter-stained with 4’,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and slides were mounted with Mowiol. Images were acquired using an inverted IX81 microscope equipped with an Olympus UPLSAPO 60× oil objective (numerical aperture: 1.35) on an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning system, using an FVD10 SPD spectral detector and diode lasers of 405 nm (DAPI) and 495 nm (Alexa488).

Determination of PLP and PL by HPLC

Samples were derivatized as described (Talwar et al., 2003). Briefly, 100 µL of lysate were mixed with 8 µL derivatization agent (containing 250 mg/mL of both semicarbazide and glycine), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were then deproteinized by the addition of perchloric acid (8 µL of a 72% [wt/vol] stock solution), followed by centrifugation at 15,000×g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants (100 µL) were neutralized with 10 µL NaOH (25% [vol/vol] stock solution), and 2 µM pyridoxic acid (PA) was added as an internal standard. PLP and PL were subjected to the same derivatization protocol to establish a standard curve. Samples were analyzed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany), using 60 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA, 9.5% (vol/vol) MeOH; pH 6.5 as mobile phase. PL, PLP, and pyridoxic acid (PA) were separated on a 3 μm reverse phase column (BDS-HYPERSIL-C18, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chromatograms were analyzed using Chromeleon 7 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Western blotting

Tissue or cell homogenates (prepared as detailed above for HPLC analysis) were extracted with 4× RIPA buffer (final concentration, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl, 1% [vol/vol] Triton X-100, 0.5% [vol/vol] sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% [wt/vol] SDS, 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride [Pefabloc], 5 μg/mL aprotinin, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL pepstatin) for 15 min at 4°C under rotation, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation (20,000×g, 15 min, 4°C). Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semidry blotting. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal α-actin, clone C4, Sigma Aldrich; rabbit monoclonal α-PDXP, clone C85E3, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; rabbit polyclonalα-PDXK (AB1), Sigma-Aldrich; and rabbit polyclonal α-PNPO, Thermo Fisher Scientific, as described in Jeanclos et al., 2019. Western blots were densitometrically quantified with NIH ImageJ, version 1.45i.

Phosphatase plasmids and cloning

N-terminally GST-tagged, human PDXP was in pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK). N-terminally His6-SUMO-tagged human PDXP was cloned into pET-SUMO (coding for human SUMO; a kind gift of Dr. Pedro Friedmann Angeli, Rudolf-Virchow-Center, University of Würzburg, Germany); His6-SenP2 (EMBL Heidelberg) was in pET-M11. All other phosphatases were of murine origin and were subcloned into pET-M11 (EMBL), as described (Jeanclos et al., 2022). Murine Pdxp point mutants (generated by nested PCR) were subcloned into the NcoI (PciI for Psph) and EcoRI restriction sites of pET-M11, using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Pdxp-D14N was generated with the Platinum SuperFi II DNA Polymerase Mastermix according to mutagenesis protocol A provided by the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cloned into pET-M11 as described above. Primers were purchased from Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany), and all constructs were verified by sequencing (Microsynth Seqlab, Göttingen, Germany).

Expression and purification of recombinant proteins

Human His6-SUMO-tagged PDXP was grown in ZYP-5052 autoinduction medium for 7 hr at 37°C, followed by 48 hr at 21°C (Studier, 2005). All purification steps of murine PDXP and murine PGP were carried out exactly as described (Jeanclos et al., 2022). The purification of the His6-SUMO-tagged human PDXP was carried out exactly as described for murine His6-tagged PDXP (Jeanclos et al., 2022), except that human SenP2 protease was used to cleave the His6-SUMO-tag. N-terminally His6-tagged PDXP variants and His6-SenP2 were expressed as described for PDXP-WT (Jeanclos et al., 2022). With the exception of PDXP-D14, the His6-tag was not cleaved off. Human GST-PDXP was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Stratagene Europe/VWR, Darmstadt, Germany). Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 18 hr at 20°C. All subsequent purification steps were carried out at 4°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 8000×g and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM triethanolamine [TEA], 500 mM NaCl; pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and 150 U/mL DNase I (Applichem, Renningen, Germany). Cells were lysed using a cell disruptor (Constant Systems, Daventry, UK), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000×g. GST-PDXP was batch-purified on a glutathione sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). After extensive washing with 25 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mM TEA, 250 mM NaCl; pH 7.4), GST-PDXP was eluted in wash buffer supplemented with 10 mM reduced glutathione, concentrated, and further purified in buffer A (50 mM TEA, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2; pH 7.4) using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg gel filtration column operated on an ÄKTA liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare).

High-throughput screen for PDXP modulators

The screening campaign (chemical library, screening protocol, concentration-dependent assays, data analysis) was conducted exactly as described previously (Jeanclos et al., 2022), except that the primary screen was done with PDXP, the counter-screen with PGP, and PDXP inhibitor hits were validated using PLP as a physiological PDXP substrate.

IC50 determinations, enzyme kinetics, and compound selectivity

Conditions for enzymatic assays were as previously published (Jeanclos et al., 2022), with the following modifications. Bovine brain calcineurin (PP2B, Sigma-Aldrich #C1907) activity against the PKA regulatory subunit type II (phosphopeptide DLDVPIPGRFDRRVpSVAAE; Sigma-Aldrich #207008) was assayed at 37°C in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.025% (vol/vol) NP40; pH 7.5. Recombinant human PTP1B (amino acids 1–321, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) activity against the Tyr992 autophosphorylation site of EGFR (DADEpYLIPQQG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) was assayed at 30°C in 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, 1 mM EDTA; pH 7.2. Murine PDXP-D14A was assayed exactly like PDXP-WT in 30 mM TEA, 5 mM MgCl2, 30 mM NaCl; pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.01% (vol/vol) Triton X-100.

Flavone stocks were prepared at 10 mM in 100% DMSO. A constant final DMSO concentration of 0.4% was maintained under all conditions, and solvent control samples contained 0.4% DMSO without compounds. Purified phosphatases were pre-incubated for 10 min at RT with serial dilutions of flavones. Dephosphorylation reactions were started by the addition of the indicated substrate; buffer with substrate and the respective flavone but without the enzyme served as a background control. Prior to compound testing, time courses of inorganic phosphate release from the respective phosphatase substrates were conducted to ensure assay linearity. Inorganic phosphate release was detected with a malachite green solution (Biomol Green; Enzo Life Sciences, Lörrach, Germany); the absorbance at 620 nm (A620) was measured on an Envision 2104 multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau, Germany). Released phosphate was determined by converting the values to nmol Pi with a phosphate standard curve. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism version 9.5.1 (GraphPad, Boston, MA, USA). For IC50 determinations, loginhibitor versus response was calculated (four parameter). To derive KM and kcat values, data were fitted by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

Biolayer interferometry

PDXP was biotinylated using the EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotin kit, as recommended by the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and loaded on Super Streptavidin Biosensors (SSA) (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) as follows. SSA sensors were equilibrated for 1 hr at RT in BLI assay buffer (250 mM TEA, 5 mM MgCl2, 250 mM NaCl, 0.005% [vol/vol] TWEEN-20; pH 7.5), loaded with 200 µg/mL biotinylated PDXP, blocked with 2 µg/mL biocytin, and washed in BLI assay buffer. Reference SSA sensors were blocked with 2 µg/mL biocytin (Wartchow et al., 2011). Six point 1:1 serial dilution series of 7,8-DHF and 5,7-DHF were prepared in DMSO, and BLI assay buffer was added to the wells to obtain a 7,8-DHF starting concentration of 25 µM. The final DMSO concentration was 5% (vol/vol). Buffers for baseline, dissociation, and buffer correction wells were supplemented with the same amount of DMSO for identical buffer conditions. Four measurements were carried out per condition, using one sensor set for two measurements. All measurements were conducted on an Octet K2 device (Sartorius) using 96-well plates. Assay settings were as follows: baseline measurement 45 s, association time 90 s, dissociation time 150 s. The resulting data were processed using the double reference method of the Octet analysis software for removal of drifts and well-to-well artifacts. Kinetic analyses were performed using the Octet analysis software. The steady-state analysis was carried out with OriginPro 2021b (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA), using a dose-response model for regression. Due to the poor solubility of 7,8-DHF, the highest concentration of 25 µM was not included in the analysis.

PDXP crystallization and data collection

For co-crystallization with 7,8-DHF, full-length murine PDXP (10 mg/mL in 50 mM TEA; 250 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2; pH 7.4) was supplemented with a threefold molar excess of the flavone. Prism-shaped crystals of 7,8-DHF-bound murine PDXP were grown at 20°C in 0.1 M phosphate citrate (pH 4.2) and 40% (vol/vol) PEG 300 using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Human PDXP crystals were grown at 20°C in 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5) and 1 M diammonium hydrogen phosphate, or in 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0), 15% (vol/vol) Tacsimat pH 7.0 (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) and 2% (wt/vol) PEG 3350 using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were cryoprotected for flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen by soaking in mother liquor containing 25% (vol/vol) glycerol. Diffraction data of murine PDXP in complex with 7,8-DHF were collected from flash-cooled crystals at a temperature of 100 K on beamline BL 14.1 at the BESSY synchrotron (Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin, Germany). Diffraction data of 7,8-DHF bound to human PDXP were collected on beamline ID23-2 at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) (https://data.esrf.fr/doi/10.15151/ESRF-ES-1409594895). Diffraction data were processed using XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and further analyzed with Aimless (Evans and Murshudov, 2013) of the CCP4 suite (Winn et al., 2011). The structures of 7,8-DHF-PDXP were solved by molecular replacement with the program Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) with the structure of the murine PDXP (PDB entry 4BX3) or human PDXP (PDB entry 2P27) as search models, and refined with Phenix (Adams et al., 2010). Model building was carried out in COOT (Emsley et al., 2010). Structural illustrations were prepared with PyMOL 2.5.1 (Schrodinger, 2021).

Convincing
Important
Following small molecule screens, this study provides convincing evidence that 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (DHF) is a competitive inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphatase. These results are important since they offer an alternative mechanism for the effects of 7,8 dihdroxyflavone in cognitive improvement in several mouse models. This paper is also significant due to the interest in the phosphatases and neurodegeneration fields.

Summary:

This manuscript set out to identify selective inhibitors of the pyridoxal phosphatase (PDXP). Previous studies had demonstrated improvements in cognition upon removal of PDXP, and here the authors reveal that this correlates with an increase in pyridoxal phosphate (PLP; PDXP substrate and an active coenzyme form of vitamin B6) with age. Since several pathologies are associated with decreased vitamin B6, the authors propose that PDXP is an attractive therapeutic target in the prevention/treatment of cognitive decline. Following high throughput and secondary small molecule screens, they identify two selective inhibitors. They follow up on 7, 8 dihydroxyflavone (DHF). Following structure-activity relationship and selectivity studies, the authors then solve a co-crystal structure of 7,8 DHF bound to the active site of PDXP, supporting a competitive mode of PDXP inhibition. Finally, they find that treating hippocampal neurons with 7,8 DHF increases PLP levels in a WT but not PDXP KO context. The authors note that 7,8 DHF has been used in numerous rodent neuropathology models to improve outcomes. 7, 8 DHF activity was previously attributed to activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB, although this appears to be controversial. The present study raises the possibility that it instead/also acts through modulation of PLP levels via PDXP, and is an important area for future work.

Strengths:

The strengths of the work are in the comprehensive, thorough, and unbiased nature of the analyses revealing the potential for therapeutic intervention in a number of pathologies.

Weaknesses:

Potential weaknesses include the poor solubility of 7,8 DHF that might limit its bioavailability given its relatively low potency (IC50 = 0.8 uM), which was not improved by SAR. The solubility issues of 7,8 DHF have been discussed at length in the authors' response to Reviewer #3. In particular, the solubility of 7,8 DHF has been found to be variable due to the concentration and buffer conditions. The 7,8 DHF compound has an extended residence time and the co-crystal structure could aid the design of more potent molecules and would be of interest to those in the pharmaceutical industry. The images related to crystal structure have been improved with additional structural analysis of PDXP in a complex of 7,8-DHF (see revised Figure 3).

Summary:

In this study, the authors performed a screening for PDXP inhibitors to identify compounds that could increase levels of pyridoxal 5'- phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6. For the screening of inhibitors, they first evaluated a library of about 42,000 compounds for activators and inhibitors of PDXP and secondly, they validated the inhibitor compounds with a counter-screening against PGP, a close PDXP relative. The final narrowing down to 7,8-DHF was done using PLP as a substrate and confirmed the efficacy of this flavonoid as an inhibitor of PDXP function. Physiologically, the authors show that, by acutely treating isolated wild-type hippocampal neurons with 7,8-DHF they could detect an increase in the ratio of PLP/PL compared to control cultures. This effect was not seen in PDXP KO neurons.

Strengths:

The screening and validation of the PDXP inhibitors have been done very well because the authors have performed crystallographic analysis, a counter screening, and mutation analysis. This is very important because such rigor has not been applied to the original report of 7,8 DHF as an agonist for TrkB. Which is why there is so much controversy on this finding.

Weaknesses:

As mentioned in the summary report the study may benefit from some in vivo analysis of PLP levels following 7,8-DHF treatment, although I acknowledge that it may be challenging because of the working out of the dosage and timing of the procedure.

This is interesting biology. Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment. It is not clear whether supplements are effective in restoring functional B6 levels. Vitamin B6 is composed of pyridoxal compounds and their phosphorylated forms, with pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) being of particular importance. The levels of PLP are determined by the balance between pyridoxal kinase and phosphatase activities. The authors are testing the hypothesis that inhibition of pyridoxal phosphatase (PDXP) would arrest the age-dependent decline in PLP, offering an alternative therapeutic strategy to supplements. Published data illustrating that ablation of the Pdxp gene in mice led to increases in PLP levels and improvement in learning and memory trials are consistent with this hypothesis.

In this report, the authors conduct a screen of a library of ~40k small molecules and identify 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) as a candidate PDXP inhibitor. They present an initial characterization of this micromolar inhibitor, including a co-crystal structure of PDXP and 7,8-DHF. In addition, they demonstrate that treatment of cells with 7,8 DHP increases PLP levels. Overall, this study provides further validation of PDXP as a therapeutic target for the treatment of disorders associated with vitamin B6 deficiency and provides proof-of-concept for inhibition of the target with small-molecule drug candidates.

Strengths include the biological context, the focus on an interesting and under-studied class of protein phosphatases that includes several potential therapeutic targets, and the identification of a small molecule inhibitor that provides proof-of-concept for a new therapeutic strategy. Overall, the study has the potential to be an important development for the phosphatase field in general.

Weaknesses include the fact that the compound is very much an early-stage screening hit. It is an inhibitor with micromolar potency for which mechanisms of action other than inhibition of PDXP have been reported. Extensive further development will be required to demonstrate convincingly the extent to which its effects in cells are due to on-target inhibition of PDXP.

Recommendations for the authors:

There is general agreement that the study represents an advance regarding the mechanisms of pyridoxal phosphatase and 7,8 DHF. From the reviewers' comments, several major questions and considerations are raised, followed by their detailed remarks:

(1) More analysis of the solubility and dose of 7,8 DHF with regard to the 50% inhibition and the salt bridge of the B protomer, as raised by the reviewers.

(2) Is there a possible involvement of another phosphatase?

(3) Does 7,8 DHF cause an effect upon TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation?

We thank the Reviewers and Editors for their fair and constructive comments and suggestions. We have performed additional experiments to address these questions and considerations. In addition, we have generated two new high-resolution (1.5 Å) crystal structures of human PDXP in complex with 7,8-DHF that substantially expand our understanding of 7,8-DHF-mediated PDXP inhibition. The scientist who performed this work for the revision of our manuscript has been added as an author (shared first authorship).

We believe that the insights gained from these new data have further strengthened and improved the quality of our manuscript. Together, our data provide compelling evidence that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone is a direct and competitive inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphatase.

Please find our point-by-point responses to the Public Reviews that are not addressed in the Recommendations for the Authors, and the Recommendations for the Authors below.

Reviewer #2:

As mentioned in the summary report the study may benefit from some in vivo analysis of PLP levels following 7,8-DHF treatment, although I acknowledge that it may be challenging because of the working out of the dosage and timing of the procedure.

We agree that an in vivo analysis of PLP levels following 7,8-DHF treatment could be informative for the further evaluation of a possible mechanistic link between the reported effects of this compound and PDXP/vitamin B6. However, we currently do not have a corresponding animal experimentation permission in place and are unlikely to obtain such a permit within a reasonable me frame for this revision.

Recommendations For The Authors:

Reviewer #1:

The work is already well-written, comprehensive, and convincing.

Suggestions that could improve the manuscript.

(1) Include a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) in the selectivity analysis. One possibility is that 7,8 DHF acts on a PTP (such as PTP1B), leading to TrkB activation by preventing dephosphorylation. I note that a previous study has looked at SAR for flavones with PTP1B (PMID: 29175190), which is worth discussion.

We thank the reviewer for bringing this interesting possibility to our attention. We were not aware of the SAR study for flavonoids with PTP1B by Proenca et al. but have now tested the effect of 7,8-DHF on PTP1B, referring to this paper. As shown in Figure 2d, PTP1B was not inhibited by 7,8-DHF at a concentration of 5 or 10 µM. At the highest tested concentration of 40 µM, 7,8-DHF inhibited PTP1B merely by ~20%. For comparison, compound C13 (3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydroxybenzylflavone-3’,4’dihydroxymethyl-phenyl), which emerged as the most active flavonoid in the SAR study by Proenca et al. inhibited PTP1B with an IC50 of 10 µM. Consistent with the results of these authors, our finding confirms that less polar substituents, such as O-benzyl groups at positions 7 and 8, and O-methyl groups at positions 3’ and 4’ of the flavone scaffold, are important for the ability of flavonoids to effectively inhibit PTP1B. We conclude that PTP1B inhibition by 7,8-DHF is unlikely to be a primary contributor to the reported cellular and in vivo effects of this flavone.

In addition to PTP1B, we have now additionally tested the effect of 7,8-DHF on the serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin/PP2B, the DNA/RNA-directed alkaline phosphatase CIP, and three other metabolite-directed HAD phosphatases, namely NANP, NT5C1A and PNKP. PP2B, CIP and NANP were not inhibited by 7,8-DHF. Similar to PTP1B, PNKP activity was attenuated (~30%) only at 40 µM 7,8-DHF. In contrast, 7,8-DHF effectively inhibited NT5C1A (IC50 ~10 µM). NT5C1A is an AMP hydrolase expressed in skeletal muscle and heart. To our knowledge, a role of NT5C1A in the brain has not been reported. Based on currently available information, the inhibition of NT5C1A therefore appears unlikely to contribute to 7,8-DHF effects in the brain.

The results of these experiments are shown in the revised Figure 2d. Taken together, the extended selectivity analysis of 7,8-DHF on a total of 12 structurally and functionally diverse protein- and nonprotein-directed phosphatases supports our initial conclusion that 7,8-DHF preferentially inhibits PDXP.

(2) Line 144: It is unclear how fig 2c supports the statement here. Remove call out for clarity.

Our intention was to highlight the fact that 7,8-DHF concentrations >12.5 µM could not be tested in the BLI assay (shown in Figure 2c) due to 7,8-DHF solubility issues under these experimental conditions. However, since this is discussed in the text, but not directly visible in Figure 2c, we agree with the Reviewer and have removed this call out.

(3) Figure 3a. It is difficult to see the pink 7,8 DHF on top of the pink ribbon backbone. A better combination of colours could be used. Likewise in Figure 3b it is pink on pink again.

We have improved the combination of colors to enhance the visibility of 7,8-DHF and have consistently color-coded murine and the new human PDXP structures throughout the manuscript.

(4) Figure 3c and d. These are the two protomers I believe, but the colour coding is not present in 3c where the ribbon is now gray. Please choose colours that can be used to encode protomers throughout the figure.

Please see response to point 3 above.

(5) Figure 3f. I think this is the same protomer as 3c but a 180-degree rotation. Could this be indicated, or somehow lined up between the two figures for clarity? It would also be useful to have 3e in the same orientation as 3f, to better visualise the overlap with PLP binding. PLP and 7,8 DHF could be labelled similarly to the amino acids in 3f (the colour coding here is helpful).

Please see response to point 3 above. We have substantially revised the structural figures and have used consistent color coding and the same perspective of 7,8-DHF in the PDXP active sites.

(6) Figure 3g. The colours of the bars relating to specific mutations do not quite match the colours in Figure 3f, which I think was the aim and is very helpful.

We have adapted the colours of the residues in Figure 3f (now Fig. 3b and additionally Fig. 3 – figure supplement 1e) so that they exactly match the colours of the bars in Figure 3g (now Fig. 3d).

Reviewer #2:

No further comments.

Reviewer #3:

Page 4: The authors describe 7,8DHF as a "selective" inhibitor of PDXP - in my opinion, they do not have sufficient data to support such a strong assertion. Reports that 7,8DHF may act as a TRK-B-agonist already highlight a potential problem of off-target effects. Does 7,8DHF promote tyrosine phosphorylation of TRK-B in their hands? The selectivity panel presented in Figure 2, focusing on 5 other HAD phosphatases, is much too limited to support assertions of selectivity.

We agree with the Reviewer that our previous selectivity analysis with six HAD phosphatases was limited. To further explore the phosphatase target spectrum of 7,8-DHF, we have now analyzed six other enzymes: three other non-HAD phosphatases (the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2B/calcineurin, and the DNA/RNA-directed alkaline phosphatase/CIP) and three other non-protein-directed C1/C0-type HAD phosphatases (NT5C1A, NANP, and PNKP). The C1-capped enzymes NT5C1A and NANP were chosen because we previously found them to be sensitive to small molecule inhibitors of the PDXP-related phosphoglycolate phosphatase PGP (PMID: 36369173). PNKP was chosen to increase the coverage of C0-capped HAD phosphatases (previously, only the C0-capped MDP1 was tested).

We found that calcineurin, CIP and NANP were not inhibited by up to 40 µM 7,8-DHF. The activities of PTP1B or PNKP activity were attenuated (by ~20 or 30%, respectively) only at 40 µM 7,8-DHF. In contrast, 7,8-DHF effectively inhibited NT5C1A (IC50 ~10 µM). We have previously found that NT5C1A was sensitive to small-molecule inhibitors of the PDXP paralog PGP, although these molecules are structurally unrelated to 7,8-DHF (PMID: 36369173). NT5C1A is an AMP hydrolase expressed in skeletal muscle and heart (PMID: 12947102). To our knowledge, a role of NT5C1A in the brain has not been reported. Based on currently available information, the inhibition of NT5C1A therefore appears unlikely to contribute to 7,8-DHF effects in the brain. The results of these experiments are shown in the revised Figure 2d. Taken together, the extended selectivity analysis of 7,8-DHF on a total of 12 structurally and functionally diverse protein- and non-protein-directed phosphatases supports our initial conclusion that 7,8-DHF preferentially inhibits PDXP. To nevertheless avoid any overstatement, we have now also replaced “selective” by “preferential” in this context throughout the manuscript.

We have not tested if 7,8-DHF promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of TRK-B. Being able to detect 7,8-DHF-induced TRK-B phosphorylation in our hands would not exclude an additional role forPDXP/vitamin B6-dependent processes. Not being able to detect TRK-B phosphorylation may indicate absence of evidence or evidence of absence. This would neither conclusively rule out a biological role for 7,8-DHF-induced TRK-B phosphorylation in vivo, nor contribute further insights into a possible involvement of vitamin B6-dependent processes in 7,8-DHF induced effects.

Page 6: The authors report that they obtained only two PDXP-selective inhibitor hits from their screen; 7,8DHF and something they describe as FMP-1. For the later, they state that it "was obtained from an academic donor, and its structure is undisclosed for intellectual property reasons". In my opinion, this is totally unacceptable. This is an academic research publication. If the authors wish to present data, they must do so in a manner that allows a reader to assess their significance; in the case of work with small molecules that includes the chemical structure. In my opinion, the authors should either describe the compound fully or remove mention of it altogether.

We are unable to describe “FMP-1” because its identity has not been disclosed to us. The academic donor of this molecule informed us that they were not able to permit release of any details of its structure or general structural class due to an emerging commercial interest.

We mentioned FMP-1 simply to highlight the fact that the screening campaign yielded more than one inhibitor. FMP-1 was also of interest due its complete inhibition of PDXP phosphatase activity.

Because the structure of this molecule is unknown to us, we have now removed any mention of this compound in the manuscript. For the same reason, we have removed the mention of the inhibitor hits “FMP-2” and “FMP-3” in Figure 2 – figure supplement 1 and Figure 2 – figure supplement 2. The number of PDXP inhibitor hits in the manuscript has been adapted accordingly.

Page 7: The observed plateau at 50% inhibition requires further explanation. It is not clear how poor solubility of the compound explains this observation. For example, the authors state that "due to the aforementioned poor solubility of 7,8DHF, concentrations higher than 12.5µM could not be evaluated". Yet on page 8, they describe assays against the specificity panel at concentrations of compound up to 40µM. Do the analogues of 7,8DHF (Fig 2b) result in >50% inhibition at higher concentrations? Further explanation and data on the solubility of the compounds would be of benefit.

We currently do not have a satisfactory explanation for the apparent plateau of ~50% PDXP inhibition by 7,8-DHF. Resolving this question will likely require other approaches, including computational chemistry such as molecular dynamics simulations, and we feel that this is beyond the scope of the present manuscript.

We previously speculated that the limited solubility of 7,8-DHF may counteract a complete enzyme inhibition if higher concentrations of this molecule are required. Specifically, we referred to Todd et al. who have performed HPLC-UV-based solubility assays of 7,8-DHF (35). These authors found that immediately after 7,8-DHF solubilization, nominal 7,8-DHF concentrations of 5, 20 or 50 µM resulted in 0.5, 3.0 or 13 µM of 7,8-DHF in solution of (i.e., 10, 15 or 26% of the respective nominal concentration). Seven hours later, 46, 26 or 26% of the respective nominal 7,8-DHF concentrations were found in solution. Hence, above a nominal concentration of 5 µM, 7,8-DHF solubility does not increase linearly with the input concentration, but plateaus at ~20% of the nominal concentration. This phenomenon could potentially contribute to the apparent plateau of human or murine PDXP inhibition by 7,8-DHF in vitro.

However, experiments performed during the revision of our manuscript show that they HADphosphatase NT5C1A can be effectively inhibited by 7,8-DHF with an IC50-value of 10 µM (see revised Fig. 2). Together with the fact that the activity of the PDXP-Asn61Ser variant can be completely inhibited by 7,8-DHF (see Fig. 3d), we conclude that the reason for the observed plateau of PDXP inhibition is likely to be primarily structural, with Asn61 impeding 7,8-DHF binding. We have therefore removed the mention of the limited solubility of 7,8-DHF here. On p.14, we now say: “These data also suggest that Asn61 contributes to the limited efficacy of 7,8-mediated PDXP inhibition in vitro.”

The solubility of 7,8-DHF is dependent on the specific assay and buffer conditions. In BLI experiments, interference patterns caused by binding of 7,8-DHF in solution to biotinylated PDXP immobilized on the biosensor surface are measured. In phosphatase selectivity assays, phosphatases are in solution, and the effect of 7,8-DHF on the phosphatase activity is measured via the quantification of free inorganic phosphate.

In BLI experiments, we observed that the sensorgrams obtained with the highest tested 7,8-DHF concentration (25 µM) showed the same curve shapes as the sensorgrams obtained with 12.5 µM 7,8-DHF. This contrasts with the expected steeper slope of the curves at 25 µM vs. 12.5 µM 7,8-DHF. The same behavior was observed for the reference sensors (i.e., the SSA sensors that were not loaded with PDXP, but incubated with 7,8-DHF at all employed concentrations for referencing against nonspecific binding of 7,8-DHF to the sensors). The sensorgrams at 25 µM 7,8-DHF were therefore not included in the analysis (this is now specified in the Materials and Methods BLI section on p.27). To clarify this point, we now state that “As a result of the poor solubility of the molecule, a saturation of the binding site was not experimentally accessible” (p.7).

In contrast, the phosphatase selectivity assays described on p.8 could be performed with nominal 7,8-DHF concentrations of up to 40 µM. Although the effective 7,8-DHF concentration in solution is expected to be lower (see ref. 35 and discussed above), the limited solubility of 7,8-DHF in phosphatase assays does not prevent the quantification of free inorganic phosphate. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude some interference with this absorbance-based assay (e.g., due to turbidity caused by insoluble compound). Indeed, 5,6-dihydroxyflavone and 5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone caused an apparent increase in PDXP activity at concentrations above 10 µM (see Figure 2b), which may be related to compound solubility issues. Alternatively, these flavones may activate PDXP at higher concentrations.

We have tested the 7,8-DHF analogue 3,7,8,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone at concentrations of 70 and 100 µM. At concentrations >100 µM, the DMSO concentration required for solubilizing the flavone interferes with PDXP activity. PDXP inhibition by 3,7,8,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone was slightly increased at 70 µM compared to 40 µM (by ~18%) but plateaued between 70 and 100 µM. These results are now mentioned in the text (p.7): “The efficacy of PDXP inhibition by 3,7,8,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone was not substantially increased at concentrations >40 µM (relative PDXP activity at 40 µM: 0.46 ± 0.05; at 70 µM: 0.38 ± 0.15; at 100 µM: 0.37 ± 0.09; data are mean values ± S.D. of n=6 experiments).”

Page 9: The authors report that PDXP crystallizes as a homodimer in which 7,8DHF is bound only to one protomer. Is the second protomer active? Does that contribute to the 50% inhibition plateau? If Arg62 is mutated to break the salt bridge, does inhibition go beyond 50%?

We have no way to measure the activity of the second, inhibitor-free protomer in murine PDXP. We know that PDXP functions as a constitutive homodimer, and based on our current understanding, both protomers are active. We have previously shown that the experimental monomerization of PDXP (upon introduction of two-point mutants in the dimerization interface) strongly reduces its phosphatase activity. Specifically, PDXP homodimerization is required for an inter-protomer interaction that mediates the proper positioning of the substrate specificity loop. Thus, homodimerization is necessary for effective substrate coordination and -dephosphorylation (PMID: 24338687).

In the murine structure, we observed that 7,8-DHF binding to the second subunit (the B-protomer) is prevented by a salt bridge between Arg62 and Asp14 of a symmetry-related A-protomer in the crystal lace (i.e., this is not a salt bridge between Arg62 in the B-protomer and Asp14 in the A-protomer of a PDXP homodimer). As suggested, we have nevertheless tested the potential role of this salt bridge for the sensitivity of the PDXP homodimer to 7,8-DHF.

The mutation of Arg62 is not suitable to answer this question, because this residue is involved in the coordination of 7,8-DHF (see Figure 3b), and the PDXP-Arg62Ala mutant is inhibitor resistant (see Figure 3d). We have therefore mutated Asp14, which is not involved in 7,8-DHF coordination. As shown in the new Figure 3 – figure supplement 1d, the 7,8-DHF-mediated inhibition of PDXPAsp14Ala again reached a plateau at ~50%. This result suggests that while an Arg62-Asp14 salt bridge is stabilized in the murine crystal, it is not a determinant of the active site accessibility of protomer B in solution.

To address this important question further, we have now also generated co-crystals of human PDXP bound to 7,8-DHF, and refined two structures to 1.5 Å. We found that in human PDXP, both protomers bind 7,8-DHF. These new, higher resolution data are now shown in the revised Figure 3 and its figure supplements, and we have moved the panels referring to the previously reported murine PDXP structure to the Figure 3 – figure supplement 1. Thus, both protomers of human PDXP, but only one protomer of murine PDXP bind 7,8-DHF in the crystal structure, yet the 7,8-DHFmediated inhibition of human and murine PDXP plateaus at ~50% under the phosphatase assay conditions (see Figure 2a). We conclude that 7,8-DHF binding efficiency in the PDXP crystal does not necessarily reflect its inhibitory efficiency in solution.

Taken together, these data indicate that the apparent partial inhibition of murine and human PDXP phosphatase activity by 7,8-DHF in our in vitro assays is not explained by an exclusive binding of 7,8DHF to just one protomer of the homodimer.

Page 10-12; Is it possible to generate a mutant form of PDXP in which activity is maintained but inhibition is attenuated - an inhibitor-resistant mutant form of PDXP? Can such a mutant be used to assess on-target vs off-target effects of 7,8DHF in cells?

This is an excellent point, and we agree with the Reviewer that such an approach would provide further evidence for cellular on-target activity of 7,8-DHF. Indeed, the verification of the PDXP-7,8DHF interaction sites has led to the generation of catalytically active, inhibitor-resistant PDXP mutants, such as Tyr146Ala and Glu148Ala (Fig. 3d). However, the biochemical analysis of such mutants in primary hippocampal neurons is a very difficult task.

Primary hippocampal neurons are derived from pooled, isolated hippocampi of mouse embryos and are subsequently differentiated for 21 days in vitro. The resulting cellular yield is typically low and variable, and the viability (and contamination of the respective cultures with e.g. glial cells) varies from batch to batch. Although such cell preparations are suitable for electrophysiological or immunocytochemical experiments, they are far from ideal for biochemical studies. A meaningful experiment would require the efficient expression of a catalytically active, but inhibitor-resistant PDXP-mutant in PDXP-KO neurons. In parallel, PDXP-KO cells reconstituted with PDXP-WT (at phosphatase activity levels comparable with the PDXP mutant cells) would be needed for comparison. Unfortunately, the generation of (a) sufficient numbers of (b) viable cells that (c) efficiently express (d) functionally comparable levels of PDXP-WT or -mutant for downstream analysis (PLP/PL-levels upon inhibitor treatment) is currently not possible for us.

Human iPSC-derived (hippocampal) spheroids are at present no alternative, due to the necessity of generating PDXP-KO lines first, and the difficulties with transfecting/transducing them. Such a system would require extensive validation. We have attempted to use SH-SY5Y cells (a metastatic neuroblastoma cell line), but PDXK expression in these cells is modest and they produce too little PLP. We therefore feel that this question is beyond the scope of our current study.
