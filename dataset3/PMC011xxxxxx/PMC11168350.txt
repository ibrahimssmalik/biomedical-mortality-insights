pmcObesity has become a global public health concern. The worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity for child‐bearing women has dramatically increased over the past 40 years (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016). As the beginning part of the first 1000 days, pregnancy is a critical window for both maternal and child health in both the short and long term. Maternal nutrition can impact foetal intrauterine growth and development, low birth weight, macrosomia, and childhood obesity (Larque et al., 2019). In addition, maternal nutrition is associated with maternal complications during pregnancy, including inappropriate gestational weight gain (GWG), gestational hypertension, and gestational diabetes (Santos et al., 2019). GWG is a common indicator used to monitor nutritional status during pregnancy. GWG is significantly related to small‐for‐gestational‐age (SGA), preterm birth, large‐for‐gestational‐age (LGA), macrosomia, caesarean section, gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension (Goldstein et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2019). Excessive GWG is related to higher post‐partum weight retention and percentage of body fat, even at 7 years postpartum (Widen et al., 2015), which could increase the risk of overweight/obesity for child‐bearing women.

Inappropriate GWG has become highly prevalent. A meta‐analysis showed that 51% of pregnant women had excess GWG (EGWG) and about 20% (18% or 21%) of pregnant women had inadequate gestational weight gain in Europe and the USA (Goldstein et al., 2018). Based on Asian BMI criteria, a similar prevalence of inappropriate GWG was seen in Asia (Goldstein et al., 2018). According to a national survey in China, two thirds of pregnant women had inappropriate GWG based on IOM standards (Wang et al., 2018).

Several GWG guidelines have been developed to monitor weight gain during pregnancy (IOM Institute of Medicine and NRC National Research Council, 2009; Kac et al., 2021; Standard of Recommendation for Weight Gain during Pregnancy Period, 2022). Some scientific bodies across several developed countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, have adopted the Institute of Medicine (IOM) GWG guideline (Harrison et al., 2021), which is based on observational study findings from populations in high‐income countries. However, this guideline is not applicable to other populations including those that are thinner and shorter women compared to American women according to IOM's statements (IOM Institute of Medicine and NRC National Research Council, 2009). Few developing countries have established their own GWG guidelines. For example, a recent Brazil GWG chart was shown to be quite different from the IOM GWG chart, regarding the rate of GWG (Kac et al., 2021). In China, a GWG standard was released recently (Standard of Recommendation for Weight Gain during Pregnancy Period, 2022), which differs from IOM GWG standards in terms of total GWG (China: 8–14 kg vs. IOM: 11.5–16 kg) and GWG velocity during the second and third trimesters (China: 0.26–0.48 kg/wk vs. IOM: 0.35–0.50 kg/wk) for normal weight women. The World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for data on GWG to develop global GWG standards (World Health Organization, 2023), which could be applied to women of all pre‐pregnancy body mass index (BMI) levels and across different regions. The aim is that these optimal GWG standards would be used to improve maternal and infant health outcomes.

The purpose of this special collection of papers is to bring together research that has been conducted on GWG in China. These papers (Song et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) provide new local evidence that may be used for developing global GWG guidelines.

Previous studies have shown that the total GWG is associated with LGA and SGA (Goldstein et al., 2017), but few studies have assessed the relationship between GWG velocity during each trimester and birth outcomes and pregnancy complications (Zheng et al., 2019). The paper by Wang et al. (2023). in this section of Maternal & Child Nutrition is based on a prospective cohort study in China, in which the gestational weights were measured on average 10 times during women's pregnancies. The prevalence of LGA and SGA was 12% and 4%, respectively (Wang et al., 2023). For pregnant women with normal BMI (18.5–23.9 kg/m2), LGA newborns were associated with higher GWG velocities than appropriate‐for‐gestational‐age (AGA) newborns in each trimester (first, second and third, respectively). By contrast, SGA newborns were associated with lower GWG velocities than AGA newborns only in the second and third trimesters (Wang et al., 2023).

The second paper in this section describes the relationship between GWG timing (each trimester) and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (i.e. gestational hypertension and pre‐eclampsia) in obese women (Song et al., 2023). In their retrospective cohort study, Song et al. (2023). reported that excessive weight gain during the first trimester and rapid weekly weight gain after 20 weeks predicted a high risk of hypertensive disorders in obese pregnant women. They concluded that the first trimester of pregnancy may be critical for gestational weight management (Song et al., 2023).

In the third paper of this section, Yang et al. (2023) describe the relationship between diet quality and excessive GWG from a prospective cohort study (Yang et al., 2023). The study showed that higher diet quality during the second and third trimesters was associated with lower odds of excessive GWG for both normal weight and overweight women. Adequacy of healthy food during the second and third trimesters was protective against excessive GWG (Yang et al., 2023).

In summary, these papers provide evidence that GWG velocity during the first trimester is a key determinant for higher risk of LGA newborns and gestational hypertensive disorders, even though GWG during the second and third trimesters could predict higher risk for maternal outcomes (gestational hypertension and pre‐eclampsia) and birth outcomes (LGA and SGA) as well. The relationship between GWG velocity and other outcomes (e.g., gestational diabetes, post‐partum weight retention and childhood obesity) warrants further exploration. A high‐quality diet during the second and third trimesters might be a protective factor against excessive GWG in the Chinese population. As these studies were mainly conducted in urban China, further studies, especially the association between diet and excessive GWG, and maternal child‐health outcomes, including breastfeeding (Pérez‐Escamilla, 2023), need to be conducted in other parts of China and beyond.
