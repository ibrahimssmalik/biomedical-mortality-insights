Following publication of the original article [1], the authors stated that in the "Availability of data and materials" section, they included the provisional NCBI code (SUB6046921) for DNA sequences. However, this code currently is not available. To ensure data accessibility, they would like to include the following sentence for clarity:

"The 16S rRNA gene dataset is available under BioProject ID PRJNA556854 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA556854 )"

The original article has been updated.

Denise P. Silva and Helena D. M. Villela contributed equally to this work.
