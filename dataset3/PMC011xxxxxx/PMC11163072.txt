pmcIn the published article, there was an error in Figure 9 as published. Specifically, in Figure 9D, the same image was repeated for both ALDH- HES1 (Veh) and ALDH + Ki67 (ASR490). The correct IHC image for ALDH- HES1 (Veh) has been updated. The corrected Figure 9 and its caption appear below.

FIGURE 9 ASR490 reduces the tumor burden of xenotransplanted breast tumors. (A) Oral administration of ASR490 (25 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the growth of ALDH− and ALDH+ xenotransplanted tumors (n = 6, *p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). (B) Tumor weight of vehicle and ASR490 treated ALDH− and ALDH+ tumors. (C) Western blots performed for Notch1-NICD and HES1 on vehicle and ASR490-treated ALDH− and ALDH+ tumors. (D) IHC analyses was performed on vehicle and ASR490-treated ALDH− and ALDH+ tumors to evaluate the expressions of Notch1-NICD, HES1, and Ki67 (proliferation marker). p values were calculated using a two-sided Student’s t-test.

The authors apologize for this error and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way. The original article has been updated.
