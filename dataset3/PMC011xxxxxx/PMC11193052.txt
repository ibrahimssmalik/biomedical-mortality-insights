Abstract

Background

Orenburg Region is located in the South Urals, mostly in the steppe zone and is characterised by various landscapes suitable for many Chenopodiaceae. The species of Chenopodiaceae are present in all major plant communities (saline vegetation, steppes, on limestone, chalk and sand, and as degraded or ruderal communities). In the steppe zone, many native subshrubby species (Atriplexcana, Caroxylonlaricinum, Suaedaphysophora) playing a crucial role in semi-deserts (known as southern steppes in the recent Russian literature) located southwards of Orenburg Region are locally found, and several annuals (Salicorniaperennans, Suaeda spp.) are most common dominants in plant communities. Some typical semi-desert species (Kalidiumfoliatum, Bassiahyssopifolia, Sodafoliosa, Spirobassiahirsuta) are found in the easternmost part of the region.

New information

We compiled a checklist of Chenopodiaceae in Orenburg Region, with two new records (Chenopodiumvirgatum, Corispermumlaxiflorum), based on our critical revision, comprehensive inventory of herbarium specimens and documented observations and field research. In total, we report 76 species in the Region, which is the third-highest number of the Chenopodiaceae species compared with other administrative territories of European Russia, North Caucasus and West Siberia. Alien and native taxa are distinguished. Zonal patterns of species distributions are confirmed. A preliminary conservation status is proposed for each native species. Three species are recommended for exclusion from the Red Data Book of Orenburg Region: Petrosimoniatriandra (because of its extensive distribution), Kalidiumfoliatum and Anabasissalsa (because of the lack of actual threat to their populations). Arthrophytumlehmannianum and Salsolarosacea are considered threatened (Vulnerable) because of their restricted occurrence and population size and because their localities are under anthropogenic pressure. Atriplexhortensis, Atriplexrosea, Chenopodiumacuminatum, C.karoi, C.praetericola, C.vulvaria, Climacopteraaffinis, C.crassa, Halimocnemiskarelinii, Salsolapaulsenii and Xylosalsolaarbuscula are excluded from the checklist, based on various reasons as discussed in the paper. Point distribution maps are provided for each species. Agriophyllumpungens (Vahl) Link is accepted as the correct authorship instead of "M.Bieb. ex C.A.Mey."

Orenburg Region is a first-level administrative territory (federal subject) of the Russian Federation (Fig. 1). It covers the southern extensions of the Ural Mountains (Guberlya Mts.) and adjacent portions of the East European Plain in the west and the West Siberian Plain in the east, which are mostly hilly; it also includes tiny portions of the Caspian Lowlands in the south-west. Orenburg Region is divided by the border between Europe and Asia, tentatively running along the watershed of the Urals (Shahgedanova et al. 2002). At the Russian scale, it is a relatively small administrative territory that extends to slightly less than 124,000 km2, thus ranking 39 in the list of federal subjects of Russia by area.

The family Chenopodiaceae Vent (Amaranthaceae Juss. s.l.) is most abundant in arid zones of Eurasia (Wulf 1943, Zhu 1995, Akhani et al. 1997). The majority of Chenopodiaceae in the Eurasian steppe zone, including Orenburg Region, are confined to open plant communities, especially on saline substrates (Prokopyeva et al. 2021). This type of vegetation is characterised by a wide variability in response of plants to the local conditions (e.g. Kamenetskaya (1952), Gordeeva and Larin (1965), Saiz et al. (2018)). Open vegetation types, most commonly steppes, are threatened due to extensive agricultural use of the steppe zone in the recent times (Török et al. 2016, Tsiripidis 2016, Liu and Wang 2021). In Orenburg Region, five species of Chenopodiaceae (Anabasiscretacea Pall., A.salsa (Ledeb.) Benth. ex Volkens, Kalidiumfoliatum (Pall.) Moq., Nanophytonerinaceum (Pall.) Bunge, Petrosimoniatriandra (Pall.) Simonk.) were included in the Red Data Book of Orenburg Region (Belov 2019).

The Chenopodiaceae of Orenburg Region were not specifically studied between the late 18th century and the early 20th century. Although the territory of present-day Orenburg Region was effectively included in the Russian Empire by building a chain of fortifications along the Southern Urals in 1730s-1740s, it was rarely visited by botanists due to its remote position at the very limit of the Empire and the ongoing battles with the nomadic population. Fenzl (1851) provided the first records of seven most common species of Chenopodiaceae in the territory, based on the collections of P.S. Pallas from the 18th century. Among the early plant hunters, G.S. Karelin and Antonov (first name unknown) collected some specimens from "Orenburg", but their annotations are considered unreliable (e.g. Knjazev (2009)) because their specimens were most likely at least partly collected in present-day Kazakhstan. The first reliable scientific collections of Chenopodiaceae of Orenburg Region were assembled by Yu. Schell, D.I. Litvinov and other people who made botanical excursions to the Southern Urals and neighbouring steppes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but a large-scale botanical exploration of the terrirory started following the ground-breaking description and analysis of the vegetation of south-eastern European Russia and north-western Kazakhstan published by Krascheninnikov (1925).

Iljin (1930) critically summarised the knowledge on the diversity of Chenopodiaceae in south-eastern European Russia, including parts of Orenburg Region, based on the herbarium collections which are partly at LE, but partly no longer available. He developed an original taxonomy of the family and provided an analysis of its diversity and distributions according to the vegetation zones delimited by Krascheninnikov (1925). This treatment was a milestone in taxonomic studies of Chenopodiaceae in the arid zone of Eurasia.

Further accumulation of herbarium collections from Orenburg Region was largely connected with its geobotanical exploration, especially for the Soviet development of steppic territories into arable lands (Ryabinina 1998).

The multivolume Flora of Eastern Europe belongs to the most siginificant floristic overviews of the late 20th century (Sennikov and Geltman 2005). It provided taxonomic and distributional data for the territories situated west from the Ural watershed, i.e. including the western part of Orenburg Region. This work (Gusev 1996, Medvedeva 1996, Mosyakin 1996, Tzvelev 1996) gives a broad-scale overview of the taxonomy and distributions of Chenopodiaceae of Eastern Europe. Due to the brief format of this work, it is impossible to separate the data on Orenburg Region or even ascertain the presence of some species in the region because individual administrative territories were not specified. In particular, many species (e.g. Chenopodiumvulvaria) were treated in this work as occurring in the whole territory of the Transvolga Floristic Region, including Orenburg Region, which have never been reported in more detailed surveys and supported by herbarium specimens or other documented observations. Atriplexrosea was also included in this work, but treated as absent in Orenburg Region by Sukhorukov et al. (2022) .

The modern period in floristic works was started with Z.N. Ryabinina, who studied the flora and vegetation of Orenburg Region towards a floristic synopsis with detailed distributions (Ryabinina 1998), inventories of protected (Ryabinina 1995), arboreous (Ryabinina and Vyelmovsky 1999), riparian and aquatic plants (Ryabinina and Rachenkova 2008) and the steppic vegetation (Ryabinina 2003). Her floristic works were based on extensive field observations, but practically no voucher specimens were preserved, thus not allowing the verification of the distributional data. During the same period, extensive herbarium collections were made by field botanists from Ekaterinburg, M.S. Kniazev and P.V. Kulikov. As a result of this collection activity, a new treatment of Chenopodiaceae was published (Knjazev 2009), with supplements based on the later fieldwork (Golovanov et al. 2018).

In 2020-2021, the first author in cooperation with other botanists carried out fieldwork in Orenburg Region, specifically targeting the family Chenopodiaceae. During our field and herbarium studies, we noted that the taxonomic composition of the family, species distributions, their roles in plant communities and possible conservation need to be further studied in details or significantly improved. Some important data (recorded by Ryabinina) cannot be authenticated properly, whereas many older herbarium collections originated from Orenburg Region in the 1930s and scattered in local herbaria (e.g. MOSP, PKM) have never been revised and included in floristic and conservational work. Other important treatments either utilised the information accumulated in the largest Russian herbaria (LE and MW) or were based on the locally collected and preserved information. To date, no attempt has been made to summarise and verify the information accumulated in all the collections, in order to produce a reliable treatment of Chenopodiaceae in Orenburg Region and its analysis in the context of the zonal patterns of Eurasian steppes.

The aims of the present study are: (1) to include new records and more information about species distributions of Chenopodiaceae in Orenburg Region, based on a new critical revision of the herbarium material in all available collections and our own field work, as well as comparisons of the species diversity between Orenburg Region and other territories in the steppic zone of Eastern Europe, North Caucasus and West Siberia; (2) to revise distributions and produce point maps for all species, showing their distrubition patterns; and (3) to re-evaluate their conservation status in provisional IUCN assessments.

Materials and methods

Study area

This study is strictly limited by the administrative borders of Orenburg Region, Russian Federation. Bounding coordinates: south-west 50.506° N, 50.768° E; north-east 54.374° N, 61.066° E.

Orenburg Region lies in the forest-steppe and steppe zones (Fig. 2) but includes a variety of intrazonal landscapes, i.e. limestones, sands and saline lands (Ryabinina 1998). In the north-western part, the steppe vegetation is interspersed by various forest types including broad-leaved and pine forests. The steppe zone is subdivided into two belts, which remarkably differ in their water regime and vegetation: the northern steppe, a more humid area of Stipa, Festuca and forb steppes and the true steppe, a drier area of Stipa and Festuca steppes with a considerable participation of semi-desert plants and a lesser influence of forbs (Chibilyov 2002). The flora and vegetation are remarkably different in the European and Siberian parts of the Region, depending on the influence of the European and Central Asian floras (Krascheninnikov 1925). This difference is based on a higher continentality of the Asian steppes (Chibilyov 2002). According to recent studies (Safronova 2021), Artemisieta santonicae and Artemisieta lerchianae predominate in the Transvolga Region, whereas Artemisieta nitrosae prevails in the Transural Region. This difference may also be caused by a greater aridity and continentality of the Transuralian territories, because the Ural Mountains effectively act as a barrier for the oceanic climate (Shahgedanova et al. 2002).

The exact delimitation of the steppe zone in Orenburg Region has been debated and variously represented on vegetation maps, of which the most recent was published by Ogureeva (1999). We accept the subdivisions and limits of the steppe zone made in that work and corrected on the basis of recent field studies (Safronova et al. 2020, Safronova 2021).

Taxonomic scope

In this work, we include native and alien (spontaneous) taxa of Chenopodiaceae occurring in the study area. Alien taxa are considered spontaneous if they occur without direct human assistance. Unlike in previous treatments (Iljin 1936, Ryabinina 1998, Knjazev 2009), cultivated taxa (e.g. Beta vulgaris L.) are excluded if they do not occur spontaneously outside the places of their introduction or if they do not persist in places of introduction when the cultivation activities have ceased for a considerably long time. Alien taxa are subdivided into casual and established (naturalised) aliens, based on their long-term persistence (Pyšek et al. 2004).

Taxonomy

Our checklist is organised taxonomically according to the following system (genera classified in subfamilies and tribes).

Chenopodioideae Burnett: Anserineae Dumort. (Blitum L.), Dysphanieae Pax (Teloxys Moq., Dysphania R.Br.), Chenopodieae Dumort.(Atriplex L., Chenopodium L., Chenopodiastrum S.Fuentes, Uotila & Borsch, Halimione Aellen, Lipandra Moq., Oxybasis Kar. & Kir.), Axyrideae G.Kadereit & Sukhor. (Axyris L., Ceratocarpus L., Krascheninnikovia Gueldenst.).

Corispermoideae Raf.: Agriophyllum Link, Corispermum L.

Salicornioideae Kostel.: Halocnemum M.Bieb., Kalidium Moq., Salicornia L.

Suaedoideae Ulbr.: Suaeda L.

Camphorosmoideae A.J.Scott: Bassia All., Camphorosma L., Sedobassia Freitag & G.Kadereit, Spirobassia Freitag & G.Kadereit.

Salsoloideae Raf.: Caroxyleae Akhani & Roalson (Caroxylon Thunb., Nanophyton Less., Ofaiston Raf., Petrosimonia Bunge, Pyankovia Akhani & Roalson), Salsoleae C.A.Mey. (Anabasis L., Arthrophytum Schrenk, Halogeton Ledeb., Salsola L., Soda Fourr.).

Phylogenetically, the family Chenopodiaceae is accepted and circumscribed as a part of the Amaranthaceae s.l. alliance (e.g. Kadereit et al. (2003), Ogundipe and Chase (2009)). The infrafamilial relationships and generic delimitations were greatly improved and specified by the recent detailed studies based on molecular phylogeny: Hohmann et al. (2006) in Betoideae; Kadereit and Freitag (2011) in Camphorosmoideae, Kadereit et al. (2010), Fuentes-Bazan et al. (2012a), Fuentes-Bazan et al. (2012b), Sukhorukov et al. (2018), Uotila et al. (2021) in Chenopodioideae; Shepherd et al. (2005), Kadereit et al. (2006) in Salicornioideae; Akhani et al. (2007), Wen et al. (2010) in Salsoloideae and Schütze et al. (2003) in Suaedoideae. Polycnemum L., traditionally included in Chenopodiaceae s.str. (Ryabinina 1998, Knjazev 2009), is excluded from the checklist because it was placed in Amaranthaceae s.str. in molecular phylogenetic studies (Kadereit et al. 2003).

For generic delimitations and species classifications, we accepted the latest revisions of Chenopodieae (Fuentes-Bazan et al. 2012b), Dysphanieae (Uotila et al. 2021), some Chenopodium (Uotila and Lomonosova 2016, Lomonosova and Uotila 2022) and Suaeda (Lomonosova et al. 2008). The general taxonomic framework was proposed by Sukhorukov (2014).

Nomenclature

We verified and corrected the nomenclature of accepted names and their synonyms according to their protologues and the current rules of botanical nomenclature. References to the places of valid publication are provided for each name at the rank of species and below. By accepted species names, links are provided to the corresponding entries in IPNI, although the nomenclatural and bibliographic data in these entries are not necessarily full and correct. The most important synonyms are given, especially those used in the previous accounts (Iljin 1930, Gusev 1996, Medvedeva 1996, Mosyakin 1996, Tzvelev 1996, Ryabinina 1998, Knjazev 2009). Typifications are not cited as deemed inappropriate in a regional inventory, but synonyms are organised according to their types.

Distributions

Species distributions in Orenburg Region are indicated according to the current first-level administrative subdivisions (districts, largest towns). District names in English are derived from the names of their respective administrative centres.

Species distributions in Orenburg Region are compiled and visualised on point maps strictly according to the specimens examined and documented observations. Literature data (Ryabinina 1998, Knjazev 2009) may differ in details because of undocumented observations taken into account; such differences are mentioned or discussed case by case. Species distributions outside Orenburg Region follow Sukhorukov (2014), with updates.

Doubtful and unconfirmed records from the 19th century were excluded from the checklist and added to the list of rejected records, whereas more certain records of Kalidiumcaspicum and Corispermumlaxiflorum originating from the early 20th century were retained in the main checklist. These two species may be recollected like Petrosimonabrachyphylla; the first record of this species originated in the 1930s and was confirmed by three recent gatherings in this study.

We compared the number of species in Orenburg Region with those in other regions of southern European Russia (Bashkortostan, Chelyabinsk Region, Rostov Region, Samara Region, Saratov Region, Volgograd Region), West Siberia (Kurgan Region) and East Caucasus (Dagestan), from which more complete data were available. These administrative units are fully or partially located in the steppe zone, thus sharing many suitable habitats. The species numbers of Chenopodiaceae in these territories were taken from earlier accounts: Murtazaliev (2009) for Dagestan, Naumenko (2008) for Kurgan Region, Sukhorukov (2014) with additions (Muldashev et al. 2017; Sukhorukov, in prep.) for European Russia.

Material

We traced and revised almost all specimens of the Chenopodiaceae ever collected from Orenburg Region. Specimens kept in the following herbaria were studied (acronyms according to Thiers (2024)): LE, LECB, MHA, MOSM, MOSP, MW (GBIF 2023b), MWG, NNSU, ORIS, PKM, PVB, SARAT, SVER (as images), TLT, UFA (as images) and Herbarium of the Orenburg Pedagogical University (not registered in Index Herbariorum). Verified data from iNaturalist (GBIF 2023a) were also included. Our own field studies (2000-2022) were undertaken in various districts of Orenburg Region and specimens were deposited to BR, K, LE, MW, MHA and ORIS. All specimens examined and documented observations were provided as an occurrence dataset in the Supplement (Suppl. material 1).

Species occurrences were georeferenced by the authors and mapped using SimpleMappr online tool (Shorthouse 2010). For the most widespread species, we have mapped all records and additionally hatched the districts where the species are clearly present even in the absence of current records.

Conservation assessments

Regional conservation status of each native species was preliminarily assessed using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012) according to our knowledge about their distributions and projected reductions of population size (IUCN 2012b). Area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) were calculated with the Geospatial Conservation Assessment Tool (GeoCAT: Bachman et al. (2011)).

Marschall von Bieberstein (1819) introduced the species name Agriophyllumpungens in discussions under Coryspermumpungens, indicating that it will be separated as a genus in the future. Czerepanov (1973) disregarded this statement as valid publication of the genus and species combination, apparently because of their provisional acceptance by the original author. He decided that the genus name was validly published by Meyer (1831) who merely accepted the genus with a reference to Bieberstein. However, Czerepanov failed to observe that Bieberstein described and discussed the species, but provided no description or diagnosis of the genus; besides, other authors accepted this genus name earlier than Meyer. Link (1831) was the first to accept the genus and provide its validating description, together with a combination for its only species. His work was published (according to contemporary announcements in Staats- und Gelehrte Zeitung des Hamburgischen unpartheyischen Correspondenten and Kölnischer Correspondent) by the beginning of June, whereas another book with the same taxonomic content (Dietrich 1831) was published in October (according to contemporary weekly bibliographies: Bibliographie von Deutschland). The work of Meyer (1831) was printed in November, according to internal evidence.

Conservation status

Vulnerable (VU): A3(d), C1. Currently under protection, category 3 (Belov 2019).

EOO 44,800 km2, AOO 16 km2. Before the recent period of the botanical exploration, the species was known in three districts only and considered to have a limited distribution in Orenburg Region (Ryabinina 1998). Since then, further localities were discovered (Golovanov et al. 2018) and the distribution mapped here is even greater.

The species occurs exclusively on open calcareous substrates (chalk, limestone, marl, gypsaceous denudations) in small populations (Ryabinina 1998, Belov 2019). Although no apparent large-scale decline of its populations was observed, its habitats are fragile and require legal protection because of their being susceptible to anthropogenic pressure (by visiting and pasturing) and destruction by mining, which assumes projected decline of its populations in the absence of protection. Similarly, the species is protected in the neighbouring territories: Bashkortostan (Martynenko 2021) and Chelyabinsk Region (Lagunov 2017).

Conservation status

Vulnerable (VU): C1. Currently under protection, category 3 (Belov 2019).

EOO 43,300 km2, AOO 68 km2. The species has been placed under legal protection because of its rarity on the northern margin of the species distribution, because its population size was estimated at less than 1000 mature individuals and because its populations were threatened by grazing. Its currently known distribution is much more extensive than previously believed (Belov 2019) and its habitats (saline lands) are not threatened by human activities. For these reasons, we suggest that its current protection status is inappropriate and should be changed to Least Concern.

Excluded taxa

Atriplex hortensis

L.

DBAECFC6-D2D5-50A0-A90F-39DCEF79CE58

Distribution

Some specimens of this species are known in the northern territories, for example, Sverdlovsk Region (SVER!) and Bashkortostan (LE!). In the steppe zone, A.hortensis needs a freshwater irrigation and the salinisation effect is damaging the seed germination of the species, thus making its spontaneous occurrence difficult.

Notes

This species was reported as occurring in large populated places of Orenburg Region (Iljin 1930, Ryabinina 1998, Knjazev 2009), but no specimens were seen. Nevertheless, it may be found as cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.

It has disappeared from almost all territories of European Russia where it was collected in the 19th and first third of 20th centuries and all old specimens were collected in the areas located westwards of the Volga (Sukhorukov 2006, Sukhorukov et al. 2022), thus outside of Orenburg Region.

Notes

Reported by Ryabinina (1998) and Knjazev (2009). No specimens seen.

Chenopodium acuminatum

Willd.

75C7C246-CFDA-5091-B74C-0136B3FF96F0

Distribution

A species widely distributed from Central Kazakhstan, South Siberia, Central Asia and temperate Far East.

Notes

Previously reported by Ryabinina (1998) and Knjazev (2009).

All specimens seen from Orenburg Region belong to Chenopodiumalbum L. or C.betaceum Andrz. Nevertheless, future records are possible due to its presence in the neighbouring Kurgan Region (NSK!, SVER!).

Chenopodium karoi

(Murr) Aellen

C06F6B9B-5FCD-5199-A8F9-4A7EC54EA91C

Distribution

It is distributed in temperate Asia and often confused with other species (Lomonosova and Uotila 2022). In the last three decades, C.karoi was found as an alien plant along railroad embankments in the neighbouring Bashkortostan Republic (SVER!).

Notes

Knjazev (2009) reported this species as a rare alien occurring on railway embankments in western districts of Orenburg Region. No specimens were seen.

Chenopodium praetericola

Rydb.

9F0080B9-6D2F-57D0-96A7-F0D0ECA3445D

Distribution

A North American species often confused with the native narrow-leaved Chenopodiumalbum and C.betaceum. Its presence in European Russia is still doubtful. Identifications can be proven by measurements of the seed coat thickness (Sukhorukov and Zhang 2013, Sukhorukov 2014) and molecular phylogeny.

Notes

Knjazev (2009) reported this alien species from the Guberlya Mts. No specimens were seen to confirm this record.

Chenopodium suecicum

Murr.

C0B8B2BE-FDDA-567C-BA2C-AB4F75CCC1D5

Distribution

Northern Eurasia.

Notes

Ryabinina (1998) reported this segregate of the Chenopodiumalbum L. aggr. as occurring on ruderal places in the whole Orenburg Region. While the species occurrence is possible in this territory, no herbarium specimens were found to confirm this record.

Chenopodium vulvaria

L.

EFC8B97D-E094-5B61-A6F6-4789C16B26BE

Distribution

Mediterranean, West Asia, Iran, southern Central Asia, Himalayas (Groom 2015, Lomonosova and Uotila 2022).

Notes

This species was reported as a rare plant possibly occurring in the western part of Orenburg Region (Knjazev 2009), although it has been previously believed to occur throughout the whole territory (Ryabinina 1998). Some voucher specimens seen in ORIS belong to the Chenopodiumalbum aggregate and no specimens of C.vulvaria from the entire Volga-Ural region were seen by the first author.

Climacoptera affinis

(C.A.Mey. ex Schrenk) Botsch.

390B1D70-48BA-59FB-A23E-8906C0769D69

Distribution

Central Asia.

Notes

The species was once collected by Antonov in 1852 “near Orsk town” (LE). More recent collections are absent from Orenburg Region. The species is widely distributed in central and eastern Kazakhstan.

Climacoptera crassa

(M.Bieb.) Botsch.

B701EC13-F635-5576-8DF7-EF01A65D1524

Distribution

Central Asia.

Notes

Iljin (1930) reported this species from Orenburg on the basis of a single old specimen collected by Karelin in the mid-19th century. This occurrence has not been confirmed by recent specimens. The northern limit of this species distribution area lies south of Orenburg Region, in the southern part of Aqtöbe Region of Kazakhstan.

Halimocnemis karelinii

Moq.

40F98A0C-98E4-58BC-893E-D0BAAB345123

Distribution

Central Asia.

Notes

There is one old collection from Orenburg Region with the label that reads “Orsk, 1852, Antonov” (LE). We believe that this specimen was collected south of Orenburg Region, apparently in Aqtöbe Region of Kazakhstan. The species is common in southern Kazakhstan.

Petrosimonia oppositifolia

(Pall.) Litv.

C53AC0EE-DFAB-578F-A42C-4F952607C313

Distribution

Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, Central Asia.

Notes

Ryabinina (1998) reported this species from four districts of Orenburg Region. However, voucher specimens are absent in herbarium collections. Although the presence of this species is logically possible in the Region, we exclude it from the list due to the lack of documentation.

Salsola paulsenii

Litv.

D5EB6C9B-84D7-5AA8-8281-2B0839FE435F

Distribution

SE Europe (Astrakhan Region, Kalmyk Republic), Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, NW China.

Notes

Collected by Antonov in 1852 “near Orsk town”, but this record was not confirmed by later specimens. At that time, Orenburg Region was a very remote location and one of the outposts of the Russian Empire. The exact location of these records cannot be properly established and the species was seemingly collected by Antonov in northern Kazakhstan.

Xylosalsola arbuscula

(Pall.) Tzvel.

B0456154-002B-5721-A217-8454F90EA1BB

Distribution

SE Europe (Astrakhan and Volgograd Regions), Central Asia.

Notes

Collected by Antonov in 1852 “near Orsk town” (LE), but not confirmed by later gatherings. The nearest localities are known in Central Kazakhstan. So far, this conspicuous plant has not been observed during floristic work in Orenburg Region (Ryabinina 1998, Knjazev 2009).

Discussion

Data collection and species distributions

So far, our sampling is the most comprehensive attempt of data collection for Chenopodiaceae in Orenburg Region. Regarding less common species, especially those currently under legal protection, our distribution maps demonstrate that the coverage increased substantially due to the recent collection effort and the inclusion of all available herbarium specimens, especially those kept in smaller and local collections.

At the same time, we acknowledge that our current data remain partly deficient because of still insufficient sampling, especially of common and taxonomically critical taxa. Recent accounts (Ryabinina 1998, Knjazev 2009) assume broader distributions of some species; however, we were not able to verify those distributional data because of the lack of vouchers.

Although Chenopodiaceae are characteristic of arid zones as a whole, several species of this family occur at their zonal limits of distribution in Orenburg Region. For example, Atriplexoblongifolia, A.patens, Ceratocarpusarenarius, Krascheninnikoviaceratoides, Salicorniaperennans, Suaedaacuminata, S.corniculata, Bassiaprostrata, Camphorosmalessingii, C.monspeliaca etc. are characteristic of the northern steppes, whereas the northern limits of Agriophyllumpungens, Halocnemumstrobilaceum, Kalidiumcaspicum, K.foliatum, Bassiahyssopifolia, B.laniflora, Spirobassiahirsuta, Ofaistonmonandrum, Petrosimoniabrachyphylla, Anabasissalsa, Pyankoviabrachiata, Arthrophytumlehmannianum, Halogetonglomeratus etc. largely belong to the true steppes of Orenburg Region and the semi-deserts of northern Kazakhstan. Such patterns were used in phytogeographic studies by Krascheninnikov (1925) and revealed in Chenopodiaceae by Iljin (1930). We confirm the significance of zonal patterns in Chenopodiaceae using a denser geographical sampling, although we also observed that these patterns are partly blurred in Orenburg Region. For example, typical dominant plants of semi-deserts, Atriplexcana and Suaedaphysophora, extensively penetrate into true steppes, but occur sporadically there, in smaller populations.

Species richness

To date, 76 species of Chenopodiaceae are confirmed to occur in Orenburg Region (Table 1). This number is much higher than in the neighbouring administrative territories (Bashkortostan Republic, Kurgan, Rostov, Samara, Saratov Regions), is comparable to the count in Astrakhan Region and slightly lower than those in Volgograd Region and Dagestan Republic. The territories situated in the forest zone are not included in the comparisons due to the drastically decreasing species numbers.

Conservation

Although most of the Chenopodiaceae species in Orenburg Region are either common or confined to the habitats which are not exploited by humans (e.g. saline substrates), some of these species may be rare and threatened because of being situated at the margin of their distribution or because of being restricted to the habitats intensely used (e.g. calcareous deposits).

Two species (Anabasiscretacea, Nanophytonerinaceum) occur mostly on calcareous denudations, which can be destroyed by mining in the absence of protection; they are protected starting from the first edition of the regional Red Data Book. Two species (Anabasissalsa and Kalidiumfoliatum) are currently protected, because their populations are situated on the margin of their distribution. We propose adding two more species, Arthrophytumlehmannianum and Salsolarosacea, to the same category because their populations in Orenburg Region are small and situated outside the main area as the northernmost or westernmost foreposts of the species distributions.

We recommend to exclude Petrosimoniatriandra from the Red Data Book of Orenburg Region, because the actual distribution of this species, as circumscribed in our study, was found much greater than previously assumed and no apparent reduction in its population size or occurrence was observed or projected. Similarly, Kalidiumfoliatum and Anabasissalsa are proposed for exclusion because their populations are situated in saline lands, which are not threatened by anthropogenic disturbance.

As a general observation, the conservation status of Chenopodiaceae species in Orenburg Region depends on plant habitats. We do not consider species occurring on saline lands (even those with restricted distributions) as threatened because this habitat is not used in economic activities and is not under immediate threat of destruction or significant degradation. On the other hand, calcareous outcrops are the traditional target of mining for construction works and plants restricted to this habitat may be threatened due to the loss of habitats. Plants occurring in petrophytic steppes, although these habitats are outside of particular economic interest, may also be threatened because their populations may be situated near roads and may be destroyed by the expansion of the road network or because of grazing by domestic livestock. The primary importance of habitat threatening was underestimated in the previous work on plant conservation in Orenburg Region (Belov 2019), which focused more on plant rarity and, therefore, arrived at different conclusions.

Vegetation features

Xerophilous grasslands, or temperate steppe

Apart from Poaceae and many Asteraceae (mostly represented by Artemisia spp.), subshrubby Bassiaprostrata and Krascheninnikoviaceratodes (Fig. 79b) dominate in this type of natural community (Fig. 80a), sometimes with Caroxylonlaricinum. Depending on different degrees of steppe disturbance, the annual Chenopodiaceae (Atriplexoblongifolia, A.sagittata, Ceratocarpusarenarius, Chenopodiumalbum, Oxybasisurbica, Sedobassiasedoides, Salsolatamariscina) can be more or less abundant in grasslands or form patches of different origin, for example, influenced by the activities of Marmotabobak, erosion or human-based activities. According to our observations, some other true steppe annuals like Atriplexsphaeromorpha and Petrosimoniamonandra are very rare in Orenburg Region and much more frequent in steppes and semi-deserts of Kazakhstan.

Petrophytic steppe

This steppe subtype (Fig. 80b) is locally distributed in the central, western and south-eastern parts of Orenburg Region. Due to an increased salt content in the soil, uneven microrelief and stony substrate, petrophytic steppe is unsuitable for agriculture or contains plants not eaten by livestock (e.g. many Chenopodiaceae: Iljin (1936)). For these reasons, petrophytic steppes are usually less degraded compared with other open plant communities. Among other widespread plants, for example Alyssumtortuosum (Brassicaceae), Artemisialerchiana (Asteraceae), Limoniumsuffruticosum (Plumbaginaceae) and Scabiosaisetensis (Caprifoliaceae), the Chenopodiaceae are represented by the subshrubby Nanophytonerinaceum, as well as by Anabasiscretacea and Atriplexcana, both latter species being more typical of other natural vegetation types. Another subshrubby petrophytic species, Arthrophytumlehmannianum, was found only recently as a single small population (Stepanova and Safronova 2019). The annuals Salsolacollina and S.tamariscina (Fig. 79c) are also common in petrophytic communities.

Halophytic plant communities

Halophytic plant communities (Fig. 80c) are represented by ‘solonetz’ and ‘solonchak’ communities, differing in the level of salinity. They are very common in the southern and eastern parts of Orenburg Region. Nevertheless, the subshrubby chenopodiaceous plants are unevenly distributed across the territory. Kalidiumfoliatum, Atriplexlaevis (Fig. 79a) and Suaedalinifolia (Fig. 79e) are restricted to its south-eastern part (solonchaks on dried-up salt lakes and ponds), Suaedaphysophora is distributed in the eastern part, Atriplexcana and Anabasissalsa are stretching through the south and east and Halimioneverrucifera is found across the territory. All of them are at the northern limit of distribution. Other subshrubs (Camphorosma spp.) and the annuals Atriplexpatens, A.tatarica, Camphorosmasongorica, Oxybasischenopodioides, Petrosimonialitvinovii, P.triandra, Salicorniaperennans, Suaeda spp. and Sedobassiasedoides are common elements of diverse halophytic communities. In general, the role of the subshrubby Chenopodiaceae increases from the north towards the south and east.

Limestone and chalk formations

Calcareous outcrops (Fig. 80d) are locally found in the territory, especially in its southern part. Anabasiscretacea (Fig. 79d) and Nanophytonerinaceum (Fig. 79f) are characteristic of chalk hills (Golovanov et al. 2021); the subshrubby Bassiaprostrata, Krascheninnikoviaceratoides and Caroxylonlaricinum and the annuals Blitumvirgatum, Salsolatamariscina and Sodafoliosa often occur in both chalk and limestone formations.

Sands

Psammophyte communities (Fig. 80e) are not uniform in their species composition. Riverbank soil ecosystems, particularly along the Ural River, the major watercourse in the region, include several mesophytic Chenopodiaceae (Atriplexprostrata, Chenopodiumacerifolium, Corispermumsquarrosum, Oxybasisrubra, O.glauca), but some of them (Chenopodiumacerifolium, Corispermumsquarrosum) are undercollected and considered rare in the territory. Sandy steppe is another type of the psammophytic vegetation. This kind of steppes or meadows is xerophytic and contains other chenopodiaceous species (native Bassialaniflora, Corispermumhyssopifolium, Salsolacollina, Salsolatragus, alien Corispermumdeclinatum), as well as the rare native Agriophyllumpungens in the south. Recently, Chenopodiumvirgatum was discovered in degraded sandy steppe communities.

Disturbed lands

Some annual Chenopodiaceae are noxious ruderal plants. Atriplexsagittata, Chenopodiumalbum, Chenopodiastrumhybridum, Oxybasisurbica and Salsolacollina are the most common species along roadsides (Fig. 80f), degraded fluvial terraces and other dump places. Atriplexmicrantha, with scattered occurrences in halophytic communities, was recently found in ruderal plant communities (collected by APS in Orenburg City in 2021). Atriplexpatula, one of the most common ruderal plants in the forest-steppe and broad-leaved forest subzones, is not frequently found in Orenburg Region.
