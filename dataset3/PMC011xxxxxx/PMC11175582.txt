Difficulties in reasoning about others’ mental states (i.e., mentalising/Theory of Mind) are highly prevalent among disorders featuring dopamine dysfunctions (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) and significantly affect individuals’ quality of life. However, due to multiple confounding factors inherent to existing patient studies, currently little is known about whether these sociocognitive symptoms originate from aberrant dopamine signalling or from psychosocial changes unrelated to dopamine. The present study, therefore, investigated the role of dopamine in modulating mentalising in a sample of healthy volunteers. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled procedure to test the effect of the D2/D3 antagonist haloperidol on mental state attribution, using an adaptation of the Heider and Simmel (1944) animations task. On 2 separate days, once after receiving 2.5 mg haloperidol and once after receiving placebo, 33 healthy adult participants viewed and labelled short videos of 2 triangles depicting mental state (involving mentalistic interaction wherein 1 triangle intends to cause or act upon a particular mental state in the other, e.g., surprising) and non-mental state (involving reciprocal interaction without the intention to cause/act upon the other triangle’s mental state, e.g., following) interactions. Using Bayesian mixed effects models, we observed that haloperidol decreased accuracy in labelling both mental and non-mental state animations. Our secondary analyses suggest that dopamine modulates inference from mental and non-mental state animations via independent mechanisms, pointing towards 2 putative pathways underlying the dopaminergic modulation of mental state attribution: action representation and a shared mechanism supporting mentalising and emotion recognition. We conclude that dopaminergic pathways impact Theory of Mind, at least indirectly. Our results have implications for the neurochemical basis of sociocognitive difficulties in patients with dopamine dysfunctions and generate new hypotheses about the specific dopamine-mediated mechanisms underlying social cognition.

Difficulties in reasoning about others’ mental states ("Theory of Mind") are highly prevalent among disorders featuring dopamine dysfunctions, but it is not clear if these difficulties are a direct consequence of aberrant dopamine signaling. This psychopharmacology study provides insights into the role of dopamine in Theory of Mind, showing that the D2-receptor antagonist haloperidiol reduces the accuracy with which healthy adults attribute mental states.

pmcIntroduction

Sociocognitive difficulties are common among disorders featuring dopamine dysfunction, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) [1], Huntington’s disease (HD) [2], Tourette’s syndrome (TS) [3], and schizophrenia [4]. Such difficulties typically include challenges with attributing and understanding mental states (i.e., putting oneself in others’ shoes, also referred to as mentalising or Theory of Mind [ToM] [5]). Alarmingly, mentalising difficulties in the aforementioned populations are consistently associated with negative outcomes including increased disease burden and poor quality of life [6–8], but little is understood about their aetiology. Disorders that feature dopamine dysfunction are commonly linked with wider psychosocial changes including social isolation and withdrawal, and mentalising difficulties may plausibly stem from these psychosocial changes. However, a powerful, underexplored alternative is that dopamine is causally implicated in mentalising. The current literature lacks direct empirical evidence for a causal role of dopamine in ToM. To this end, we investigate the effect of a dopamine-modulating drug on the mentalising performance of healthy members of the general population and further explore several potential mechanistic pathways.

Inconsistencies in the existing literature mean that there is currently no empirical consensus supporting a causal role for dopamine in mentalising. For instance, to our knowledge, there is only 1 study directly comparing ToM abilities within people with Parkinson’s (PwP) on, and after acute withdrawal of, dopaminergic medication [9]. This study found no differences in ToM performance between drug on and off states, and performance was comparable to healthy controls in a subsample of early-stage PwP. These data, therefore, do not causally implicate dopamine in mentalising. However, the relatively preserved ToM function of PwP in the drug off state (i.e., putatively low dopamine) may also indicate an insufficient washout period or cognitive and/or neural compensation strategies in the early PD sample [10]. In support of this, a more recent study showed ToM differences in early stage drug-naïve PwP compared to control participants, which improved after 3 months of dopaminergic therapy [11]. Evidence from studies examining those with schizophrenia is equally inconclusive: For instance, 1 study [12] reported improvements in ToM ability in patients treated with certain atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine), and detrimental effects of typical antipsychotic medication (e.g., haloperidol), but putative selection bias and the lack of on-off comparisons make it impossible to clearly attribute group differences to effects of the dopaminergic drugs. Other inconsistencies, including methodological differences, as well as high between- and within-study variance in disease stage, medication, and comorbidities [11], make it difficult to draw clear inferences solely from patient studies.

An incisive way to establish a causal role is to observe the influence of dopaminergic drugs on mentalising in the healthy population. However, psychopharmacological data are scarce. While many studies have shown effects of dopamine disruption on general cognition (also referred to as “neurocognition,” e.g., attention, learning, and executive function [13]), the literature is less clear regarding influences on social cognition. While a handful of existing studies show effects of dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonism on emotion recognition [14,15] and social belief updates [16–19], to the best of our knowledge, no published study to date has explored effects of dopamine manipulation on ToM function in healthy individuals.

There are several candidate pathways that could underpin a causal role of dopamine in social cognition. Dopamine is implicated in cognitive control functions, including working memory, attention, and flexible behaviour, via its neuromodulatory actions on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [20]. Thus, any effect of dopaminergic manipulation on mentalising could, at least in part, arise from a decreased ability to maintain and manipulate mental state representations. Yet, this is perhaps unlikely to constitute the full mechanistic explanation since studies often show that ToM deficits are independent from (mild) cognitive dysfunction [7,21–24]. A second (nonmutually exclusive) hypothesis relates to action simulation. A growing body of work suggests that brain areas involved in the planning and execution of actions also respond to the observation of others’ actions, with the strength of the response being modulated by the observer’s familiarity with the action [25–27]. In other words, observing others’ actions automatically activates sensory-motor representations of one’s own movements (motor codes required to produce the same action as well as anticipatory visual codes of the upcoming action in the sequence) in the observer. It has been suggested that humans use the same forward models for predicting the consequences of one’s own movements to estimate the internal states (e.g., intentions, mental states) underlying others’ movements [28], and research indicates that higher overlap between the low-level features of one’s own and the observed action promotes higher accuracy in identifying those states [29–32]. Indeed, our previous work illustrated that similarity in movement between observer and actor facilitated mental state attribution in a classical mentalising task [30]. Recent experimental evidence has accumulated to support a role for dopamine in movement—including a role in movement vigour [33,34] as well as the control of movement kinematics [35–37]—that may be independent of its function in learning. Thus, individuals with dopamine dysfunction may exhibit differences in planning, preparation, and/or execution of movements, and these differences may contribute to difficulties in interpreting the actions of others with movements unaffected by dopamine disturbances.

Thus, using our own previously developed [30] version of a well-established mentalising task—the animations task, wherein participants label videos depicting mental (e.g., seducing) and non-mental (e.g., following) states—here, we first employed a pharmacological dopamine manipulation in healthy volunteers to investigate whether disruption of dopamine system function plays a causal role in mentalising. Second, by indexing effects of dopamine challenge on executive function (specifically working memory), motor function, and emotion recognition, we elucidate potential mechanistic pathways via which dopamine may modulate mentalising ability.

Materials and methods

Participants

Forty-three healthy volunteers (19 females; mean (M) [SD] age = 26.36 [6.3]) took part on at least one of 2 study days after passing an initial health screening. Participants were recruited via convenience sampling from University of Birmingham campus and city centres, gave written informed consent, and received either money (£10 per hour) for their participation. Five participants (2 placebo, 3 haloperidol) dropped out of the study after completing the first day, a further 5 could not complete the second test day due to COVID-19-related University closures, and consequently, all analyses are based on 33 full datasets. All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Birmingham Research Ethics Committee (ERN 18–1588) and Clinical Research Compliance Team and performed in accordance with the WMA Declaration of Helsinki (1975).

Pharmacological manipulation and general procedure

Participants’ eligibility for the study was evaluated by a clinician via review of their medical history, electrocardiogram assessment, and blood pressure check (see S1 Text for full details of inclusion/exclusion criteria). The main study took place on 2 separate test days, 1 to 4 weeks apart, where participants first completed an initial blood pressure and blood oxygenation check with the medic. Subsequently, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subjects design, each participant took part on 2 study days, wherein all participants received tablets containing either 2.5 mg haloperidol or lactose (placebo) on the first day, and the respective other treatment on the second day (order of drug day counterbalanced). For this, an independent researcher from the team pre-prepared an envelope with either placebo or haloperidol tablets. Participants were informed that none of the experimenters in the study knew the contents of the envelope. The independent researcher placed the capsules in the participants’ hand and asked them to close their eyes before swallowing the tablets. Haloperidol is a dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist, which affects dopamine transmission via binding either to postsynaptic D2 and D3 receptors (blocking the effects of phasic dopamine bursts) and/or to presynaptic autoreceptors (which has downstream effects on the release and reuptake of dopamine and thus modulates bursting itself [38,39]).

Reported mean values for peak concentration and elimination half-life of oral haloperidol lie between 1.7 and 6.1 and 14.5 and 36.7 hours, respectively [40]. After drug or placebo administration, participants rested for 1.5 hours to allow for drug metabolization. Participant reported adverse responses were rare (5 out of 43 participants) and generally mild, with the most frequent symptoms mentioned being fatigue and headache. Importantly, only 3 of the 5 participants reported side effects after having received haloperidol.

Subsequently, participants began the task battery, which included the animations task, an emotion recognition task, a visual working memory task, and a movement task (see Tasks and procedure). Throughout the day, participants’ blood pressure and oxygenation and arousal levels were checked hourly between tasks. All data were collected at the Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH) at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom.

Tasks and procedure

Participants completed a task battery including tasks not described in this study (e.g., [14,19]). All relevant tasks are outlined below in the order they were presented to participants. Task order was the same on both study days.

Visual working memory (WM) task

Participants completed an adaptation of the Sternberg [41] visual WM task, requiring them to determine whether a presented target letter was part of a previously displayed string of letters (varying in length from 5 to 9 consonants). This task is described in more detail in our previous study [14].

Animations task

To assess drug effects on mentalising ability, we used a classical task that has been widely used in the literature for its sensitivity in detecting differences in mentalising performance between control and clinical groups where other tasks have failed to do so [42]: Animations tasks typically involve participants viewing and interpreting short videos of interacting triangles, which have been animated to either display so-called mental state interactions (i.e., mentalistic interaction wherein 1 triangle intends to cause or act upon a particular mental state in the other, e.g., “surprising”; in prior research referred to as “ToM” interactions) or non-mental state interactions (also called “goal-directed” interactions; involving reciprocal interaction without the intention to cause/act upon the other triangle’s mental state, such as “following”). Within each mental state category, 2 words describing the interactions were chosen in equivalence to the words used in a seminal study by Abell and colleagues [42] and multiple following studies [43–46]: mental state: seducing, surprising; non-mental state: following, fighting. The key distinction between the 2 conditions is that the mental state (ToM) animations entail propositional attitudes wherein 1 agent intends to cause or act upon a particular mental state in the other, while non-mental state (goal-directed) animations do not require such causal inference [47]. This is corroborated by prior research where the latter have been shown to consistently elicit lower levels of spontaneous attributions of intentionality than the mental state animations [43–45]. To evaluate motor contributions to mental state inference, we additionally asked participants to produce their own animations. Task setup and procedure were largely the same as in our previous study [30]: Participants both created and viewed animations on a WACOM Cintiq 22 HD touchscreen, tilted at an angle of approximately 30 degrees on a desk. They first created their own set of 35-second animations (2 mental state: seducing, surprising; 2 non-mental state: following, fighting) by moving 2 triangles on the touchscreen using their 2 index fingers, while positional data of both triangles were recorded at a frame rate of 133 frames/second. Subsequently, participants viewed and rated seducing, surprising, following, and fighting animations that had been created by an independent sample of participants (animation stimuli were the same as in our previous study [30]). Following each animation, participants rated on 4 separate visual-analogue scales (ranging from 1 [not at all] to 10 [very]) how much they thought the last viewed stimulus depicted the target, as well as each non-target word. For each of the target words, participants viewed 8 animations, resulting in a total of 32 animations, presented in pseudorandom order, on each study day. As in our previous study [30], the 8 animations were selected to represent the full speed frequency distribution of the stimulus pool, thus reflecting the full range of population kinematics. Note that, due to the pseudorandom selection of animation stimuli on each study day, animations viewed by each participant in haloperidol trials were not necessarily the same as in placebo trials.

As in our previous study [30], accuracy for each trial was calculated by subtracting the mean rating for all non-target words from the rating for the target word. Thus, a positive score indicates that the target word (e.g., surprising) was rated higher than the average of all non-target words (e.g., seducing, following, fighting) with higher positive accuracy scores reflecting better discrimination between target and non-target words and lower or negative accuracy scores representing high confusion between scales.

Dynamic whole-body emotion recognition task

Participants viewed a total of 48 whole-body point light displays of male and female actors modelling angry, happy, and sad emotional walks (point light walkers [PLWs]; adopted from Edey and colleagues’ study [31]). Following each stimulus, participants rated on 3 separate visual-analogue scales (ranging from 1 [not at all] to 10 [very]) how intensely they felt the stimulus expressed an angry, happy, or sad emotion. In line with the literature demonstrating that sadness is conveyed via slow, sluggish movements, anger with fast, jerky kinematics, and happiness intermediate to the two [48–51], sad PLWs exhibited the slowest mean speed, followed by happy, and then angry PLWs [52]. The task is described in more detail in our previous study [14].

Movement task

Participants were asked to walk continuously between 2 sets of cones (placed 10 metres apart) for 120 seconds at their preferred walking speed. Acceleration data were recorded, using an iPhone 6s attached to the outer side of each participant’s left ankle, with the app SensorLog [53]. To obtain an estimation of mean walking speed across the whole walk, first individual mean speed per pass was calculated by dividing the pass length (10 m) by the time taken to walk from one set of cones to another. Following this, speed estimates for all passes were averaged across the whole walk.

Statistical analyses

All data were processed in MATLAB R2022a [54] and analysed with Bayesian mixed effects models using the brms [55] package in R [56]. Prior to model building, any continuous predictors were normalised and centred to allow comparisons between individual estimates. In what follows, we report our findings in terms of Bayesian credible intervals (CrIs, the Bayesian analogue of the classical confidence interval, with the exception that probability statements can be made based on CrIs [57]) and the posterior probability of models with and without an effect of interest (e.g., main effects or interactions). In brief, we used a standard analysis package (brms [55]) to assess the evidence for alternative models using a leave one out cross validation scheme (using the LOO [58] function). Crucially, using plausible (mildly informative) priors over random effects, this kind of analysis eludes a point null hypothesis—and allows us to specify, with a certain confidence, whether an effect was present or absent. This confidence is reflected by the 95% CrIs, as well as the posterior probability that a certain effect (Eμ) is different from 0 (P(Eμ<0)) or P(Eμ>0)). Consequently, for all relevant model parameters, we report expected values under the posterior distribution and their CrIs, as well as their posterior probabilities. In line with Franke and Roettger [59], we conclude that there is compelling evidence for an effect if its posterior probability P(Eμ≠0) is close to 1. We used generic weakly informative priors (in line with prior choice recommendations by the stan developer group; see https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations), following a normal distribution for the intercept and all regression coefficients and a half-Cauchy distribution for residual and random effect variances (all prior distributions centred at 0). Each model was run for 4 sampling chains with a minimum of 5,000 iterations each (1,000 warm-up iterations). There were no indications of nonconvergence (all Rhat values = 1, no divergent transitions). All models discussed in this paper are listed in detail in the Supporting information.

Results

Haloperidol resulted in reduced labelling accuracy for both mental and non-mental state animations

A Bayesian mixed effects model (Model 1.1) with random intercepts for subject ID and animation ID (unique identifier for each animation) and a random slope for the effect of drug varying by subject ID was fitted to accuracy (see Animations task) and the dummy-coded predictor drug (haloperidol [HAL] versus placebo [PLA]; reference level = PLA; see Model 1, S1A–S1E Table). The model revealed a robust main effect of drug, where haloperidol resulted in lower accuracy in labelling the animations (EμHALvsPLA = −0.56, CrI = [−0.94, −0.19]). The posterior probability that there was a truly negative effect (P(EμHALvsPLA<0) was 1. To further assess whether the drug specifically affected performance for mental state animations, the dummy-coded factor mental state (mental versus non-mental; reference level = non-mental), as well as the 2-way interaction between drug and mental state, was added to the model. This second model (Model 1.2) showed no interaction between drug and mental state (EμHALvsPLA,mentalVSnonmental = 0.20, CrI = [−0.34, 0.74]), indicating that haloperidol decreased attribution accuracy to a comparable extent for mental and non-mental state animations. Furthermore, adding mental state to the model led to an even stronger effect of drug (EμHALvsPLA = −0.66, CrI = [−1.11, −0.20]). Thus, after taking the drug, participants’ ability to correctly classify an animation decreased by 0.66 points compared to the placebo condition (see Fig 1). These results, indicating a comparable influence of haloperidol on inference about mental and non-mental states, may be mediated by dopamine’s influence on general cognitive functions—such as working memory and attention—which play a key role in inferential reasoning [60]. We return to this question in our exploratory analyses after first testing our second hypothesis that dopamine may affect mentalising indirectly via its effects on movement. Finally, in line with our previous findings [30], a main effect of mental state (EμmentalVSnonmental = −2.50, CrI = [−3.21, −1.78]) suggests that overall, participants struggled more with interpreting animations depicting mental state interactions relative to ones displaying non-mental state interactions.

Control analyses: First, while model residuals did not violate the normality assumption of linear regression, visual inspection of the response variable revealed bimodality of our data. We confirmed the present results remain after this bimodality is taken into account by additionally modelling the response as a mixture of 2 gaussian distributions (see S1 Results, S1 Fig, and S5A–S5D Table). Second, to further investigate possible confounding effects of the day the drug was taken as well as potential effects of haloperidol on arousal levels, 2 control models were performed. Model 1.3 was fit to drug and drug day (day 1 versus day 2, dummy coded), as well as their interaction, predicting accuracy. There was no interaction between drug and drug day, indicated by a negative effect of drug for drug day 1 (EμHALvsPLA,day1 = −0.52, CrI = [−1.07, 0.03]; note there is slightly increased uncertainty around the drug effect in this model, as shown by the CrI including 0), which did not differ from the drug effect on day 2 (EμHALvsPLA,day1vsday2 = −0.06, CrI = [−0.81, 0.69]). Model 1.4 was fit to drug and arousal (participant reported tiredness levels ranging from 1 = not tired at all to 10 = maximally tired; collected before the main task) predicting accuracy. The model revealed a preserved effect for drug (EμHALvsPLA = −0.52, CrI = [−1.11, 0.07], again with minimal increase in uncertainty surrounding the effect) and no main effects for arousal (see S1D Table). There was an interaction between drug and a seventh order polynomial trend for arousal; however, model comparison between models 1.1 and 1.4 confirmed that arousal level did not meaningfully contribute to explaining variance in accuracy; we therefore did not interpret this result any further.

Dopamine manipulation diminished the effect of movement similarity for mental state animations

To assess the contribution of dopamine disruption to the extent to which individuals make use of their own motor codes when judging the observed movements, jerk difference was calculated for both PLA and HAL trials by first subtracting the mean jerk (jerk was calculated as the third order non-null derivative of the raw positional data; for more details, see [30]) of each video a participant rated from their own jerk values when animating the same word, and then taking the absolute magnitude of those values. Thus, jerk difference indexes observer-animator movement similarity wherein lower values reflect higher jerk similarity. Subsequently, jerk difference was added to the previous model of drug and mental state (Model 1.2) predicting animations task accuracy. This new model (Model 2.1) reproduced the previous main effects of drug (EμHALvsPLA = −0.69, CrI = [−1.14, −0.24]) and mental state (EμmentalVSnonmental = −2.71, CrI = [−3.42, −1.99]). Furthermore, the model revealed an interaction between drug, jerk difference, and mental state, indicating that while under placebo, there was a stronger negative effect of jerk difference for mental, relative to non-mental state animations (EμjerkDiff,non-mental,PLA = −0.11, CrI = [−0.37, 0.14]; EμjerkDiff,mentalVSnonmental,PLA = −0.54, CrI = [−1.09, 0.00]), under haloperidol, this negative effect was diminished (EμjerkDiff,mentalVSnonmental,HALvsPLA = 0.68, CrI = [−0.12, 1.47], P(EμjerkDiff,HALvsPLA,mentalVSnonmental>0) = 0.95; contrasts of jerk difference slope PLA versus HAL—non-mental state: Eμ = −0.06, CrI = [−0.37, 0.28], mental state: Eμ = −0.74, CrI = [−1.47, −0.01]). Separate post hoc models for placebo and haloperidol trials confirmed this pattern, with a robust negative effect of jerk difference for mental, but not non-mental state animations in the placebo model (Model 2.2: EμPLA,jerkDiff,non-mental = −0.13, CrI = [0.41, 0.15]; EμPLA,jerkDiff,mentalVSnonmental = −0.69, CrI = [−1.32, −0.08]), and no effect of jerk difference in either mental state condition in the haloperidol model (Model 2.3: EμHAL,jerkDiff,non-mental = −0.10, CrI = [−0.38, 0.19]; EμHAL,jerkDiff,mentalVSnonmental = 0.02, CrI = [−0.69, 0.72]. Consequently, under placebo, the higher the difference in jerk between an observer and the original animator of a given mental state animation, the less accurate the observer was in classifying that animation. Thus, the present placebo results are in line with our previous findings [30], this time emphasising a role for movement similarity in promoting inference from mental state animations. In contrast, under haloperidol, there was no such effect of movement similarity for the non-mental or the mental state animations (see Fig 2A and 2B).

The disappearance of the jerk difference effect in HAL trials suggests that under haloperidol, the relationship between one’s own kinematics and the kinematics present in an animation stimulus did not affect accuracy. This result affords various interpretations. For example, it could be that participants rely less on their own motor codes (perhaps relying more on other sources of information such as visual codes) when judging animations under HAL. Alternatively, participants may rely on their own motor codes to an equal extent under HAL and PLA, but under HAL, they are relying on stored motor codes acquired across the lifetime, and upon which sensorimotor internal models are fine-tuned (i.e., their placebo movements), rather than those modified codes via which they are currently performing action [32,61]. To test the hypothesis that when observing the animations, individuals recruited their lifetime, experience-based motor codes under both PLA and HAL conditions, we calculated placebo jerk difference for each animation stimulus viewed in the haloperidol condition by subtracting a given animation stimulus’ mean jerk from the participant’s own jerk in the placebo condition.

A new model (Model 3.1) with placebo jerk difference added as covariate revealed the same main effect of drug (EμHALvsPLA = −0.73, CrI = [−1.22, −0.24]), as well as the same interaction between jerk difference and mental state as before (EμjerkDiff,non-mental = −0.16, CrI = [−0.41, 0.10]; EμjerkDiff,mentalVSnonmental = −0.55, CrI = [−1.11, 0.00]). However, there was no interaction between jerk difference, mental state, and drug (EμjerkDiff,HALvsPLA,mentalVSnonmental = 0.20, CrI = [−0.54, 0.94]), indicating a negative effect of placebo jerk difference for mental state animations for both PLA and HAL trials (see Fig 2C). To further corroborate this finding that placebo, and not haloperidol jerk difference affected accuracy in both PLA and HAL trials, we ran a second model (Model 3.2) with only HAL trials and both placebo and haloperidol jerk difference as predictors. This model clearly showed no effect of haloperidol jerk difference (EμHALjerkDiff,non-mental = 0.03, CrI = [−0.35, 0.40]; EμHALjerkDiff,mentalVSnonmental = −0.30, CrI = [−1.14, 0.50]), and an even stronger effect of placebo jerk difference (EμPLAjerkDiff,non-mental = −0.06, CrI = [−0.44, 0.31]; EμPLAjerkDiff,mentalVSnonmental = −0.70, CrI = [−1.38, −0.03], P(EμPLAjerkDiff,mentalVSnonmental <0) = 0.98, coefficient for placebo jerk difference in mental state animations = −0.06 + (−0.70) = −0.76) on mental state animations. In other words, when participants were labelling animations under haloperidol, accuracy in those judgements was affected by their own movements produced in the placebo, but not by their movements produced in the drug condition. Models 2.1 and 3 show that under both HAL and PLA, participants’ accuracy on the animations task is influenced by the similarity of the animation to the movements that they produced in the placebo condition.

Effects of haloperidol on animations task accuracy show specific relationships to drug effects on emotion recognition

To probe potential underlying mechanisms of the observed drug effects on accuracy in the animations task, we investigated relationships between drug-related changes in animations task accuracy and drug effects on tasks indexing emotion recognition and executive functions. For this, we first created a variable that indexed drug effects on animations task accuracy on an individual participant basis. Due to the random selection of animations (see [30]), participants did not necessarily view the same animations in PLA and HAL trials, making it impossible to calculate a trial-by-trial measure of drug-related changes. Thus, the accuracy measure was first transformed into a binary variable, classifying as “correct” any trial where the highest rating was given to the target word, while a trial where the highest rating was given to a non-target word was classed as “incorrect.” Subsequently, the percentage of correct trials out of all 8 trials for a given word was calculated, resulting in 2 percentage accuracy values per animation word per participant (1 PLA, 1 HAL). Finally, for each participant, drug-related changes in accuracy were calculated by subtracting percentage accuracy values of placebo days from those collected on drug days. Animations task accuracy change scores, therefore, represent the change in percentage of correct trials from placebo to haloperidol conditions, whereby positive values indicate enhanced ability to correctly label the animations after the drug, and negative values indicate a decrease in labelling accuracy.

While there is a relatively large evidence base implicating dopaminergic signalling in general cognition, including executive function [62] and learning [63], the literature is less conclusive about the role of dopamine in sociocognitive processes. Thus, to investigate whether our observed drug effects on animations task accuracy were related to drug effects on sociocognitive performance above and beyond expected relationships with drug effects on executive functions, we calculated working memory change scores as index of drug effects on working memory span and emotion recognition change scores indexing drug effects on emotion recognition by subtracting accuracy scores of PLA trials from those obtained in HAL trials for both tasks. For both indices, positive change scores indicate increased performance under haloperidol. If we observed specific relationships between drug-related changes in emotion recognition and changes in accuracy for mental state, but not non-mental state animations, this would provide support for specific effects of dopamine challenge on sociocognitive processes. A Bayesian linear model (Model 4.1; model comparison revealed that random intercepts for subject ID did not additionally explain variance; see S4B Table) was fit to emotion recognition change, working memory change, and mental state (mental, non-mental; dummy-coded, reference level = non-mental) as well as interactions between mental state and both continuous predictors, predicting animations task accuracy change. The discrete response variable was modelled as a student’s t distribution (a continuous was chosen over a cumulative model distribution based on model comparison using LOO [58] showing clear preference for the discretised continuous model; for more details, see S4C Table). The first model revealed no effect for working memory change (EμWMchange,non-mental = −0.00, CrI = [−0.01, 0.00]; EμWMchange,mentalVSnonmental = −0.00, CrI = [−0.02, 0.00]); hence, all subsequent effects are reported based on a model excluding this variable (Model 4.2). Model 4.2 revealed an interaction between emotion recognition change and mental state, with no relationship between emotion recognition change and animations task accuracy change for non-mental state animations (EμERchange,non-mental = −0.02, CrI = [−0.07, 0.03]) and, relative to non-mental state animations, a small effect indicating a positive relationship between mental state accuracy and ER accuracy (Fig 3; EμERchange,mentalVSnonmental = 0.07, CrI = [−0.00, 0.13]; P(EμERchange,mentalVSnonmental>0) = 0.96; coefficient for mental state animations EμERchange,mental: −0.02 + 0.07 = 0.05; note the CrI including 0 indicates some uncertainty surrounding this effect). Thus, for every 2 SD increase in emotion recognition accuracy after haloperidol, individuals correctly identified roughly 1 animation more (0.05 * 2 * 8 = 0.8) than under placebo, relative to those participants who showed no change in emotion recognition performance. Finally, there was no main effect of mental state (EμmentalVSnonmental = −0.01, CrI = [−0.08, 0.06]), further confirming our results from model 1 that the drug affected performance equally for mental and non-mental state animations.

Discussion

The present study used pharmacological challenge of dopamine function in combination with a classical mentalising task to evaluate whether dopamine is causally implicated in mental state attribution. Our secondary aim was to probe mechanistic pathways involved in the dopaminergic modulation of mental state attribution. To this end, we investigated relationships between effects of the dopamine manipulation on the main mentalising task and tasks indexing working memory and emotion recognition. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show detrimental effects of pharmacological dopamine manipulation on mentalising ability in a sample of healthy adults. More precisely, individuals showed reduced ability to adequately label mental state animations after administration of the dopamine D2/D3 antagonist haloperidol compared to placebo, indicating a causal role for dopamine in mental state attribution. Our findings thus show that dopaminergic pathways are, at least indirectly, involved in ToM.

Furthermore, our data did not show an interaction between the dopamine manipulation and the type of animation, indicating that haloperidol affected participants’ performance for mental state and non-mental state animations to a comparable extent. Importantly, however, the results of our secondary analyses suggest that dopamine may modulate inferences from mental and non-mental state interactions via separate pathways. We observed that effects of haloperidol on participants’ ability to correctly identify mental, but not non-mental, state animations were positively related to drug effects on their emotion recognition performance. In other words, individuals who exhibited a decrease in their mentalising ability as a response to dopamine antagonism were more likely to also have shown reduced emotion recognition performance in a dynamic whole-body emotion perception task. In contrast, drug effects on inferences from non-mental state animations were unrelated to drug-induced impairments in emotion recognition. Furthermore, effects of haloperidol on individuals’ working memory capacity did not contribute to explaining drug-related impairments in mental state attribution.

We thus speculate that these results suggest a common dopamine modulated mechanism among mental state attribution and emotion recognition ability that is independent of working memory function as indexed by the Sternberg [41] visual WM task. Recent empirical evidence from animal [64,65] and clinical [66,67] studies supports the idea that dopamine may modulate social behaviour via reward-related mechanisms. In the context of the current study, a haloperidol-induced decrease in dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway—a core brain circuit for processing reward [68]—may have resulted in participants failing to pick up specific social cues from the animations. Alternatively, recent research suggests that haloperidol may have affected the processing of social cues via coding for their perceived self-relevance: For instance, in a simple dictator game, haloperidol resulted in a shift in intentional attributions to a partner’s behaviour along an axis of self-relevance, leading to a reduction in attributions of harmful intent (i.e., relevant to the participant as harmful intent represents threat) alongside an increase in attributions of self-interest (not relevant to the participant) [16]. While self-relevance has been shown to impact stimulus processing at various stages (e.g., visual, attention, memory [69,70]), it is yet unclear whether self-relevance and reward effects rely on shared or distinct mechanisms [71]. Future research is needed to confirm the exact mechanistic and neural pathway(s) underlying the dopaminergic modulation of mentalising and emotion recognition.

We further hypothesised that dopamine challenge may affect participants’ mentalising ability by impeding their capacity to internally represent observed movements. Crucially, our data provide a partial replication of our previous results [30], showing that under placebo, movement similarity between observer and animator promotes inference from mental state animations. The present results are thus consistent with action simulation accounts [25,28,72], which suggest that individuals implicitly map observed actions onto their own motor system and that this can influence how they label observed actions. Moreover, the selectivity of the movement similarity effect to mental state animations suggests that our movement similarity measure (i.e., jerk difference) may be indexing mapping at higher levels of the “motor hierarchy” [46], reflecting integration of the motor action with its underlying intention (i.e., mentalising), rather than mapping of short-term action goals (action understanding). Within the putative mirror neuron network, the inferior parietal lobule [73,74] may be a candidate node for these higher-order action representation processes, as this region is causally implicated in decoding intentions from action kinematics [75] and recruited during animations tasks [76] (i.e., responds to kinematics without the presence of body parts). Intriguingly, we observed that under haloperidol, individuals showed the same movement similarity effect on mentalising when movement similarity was calculated based on their movements produced in the placebo condition, but not when the measure was based on movements from the haloperidol condition.

These findings, alongside the observation that haloperidol acutely affected individuals’ motor function (see S2 Results), give rise to the idea that sensorimotor representations built from a lifetime of visual and motor experiences are robust against short-term disruptions of motor output. More precisely, while haloperidol acutely affected participants’ ongoing movements, our data suggest that their internal motor codes associated with the relevant mental states were unaffected; i.e., during mentalising under dopamine challenge, participants may have recruited visuo-motor representations that were formed before their actions were affected by the drug (i.e., through their lifetimes’ experience of associating visuo-motor representations with mental state labels). In support of this explanation, we observed that, on the drug day, participants were more accurate in labelling mental states for animations that were kinematically similar to their own movements on the placebo day. This hypothesis is consistent with studies of PwP that suggest that in early stages of the disease, during action observation, PwP recruit action representations developed during the presymptomatic stage; it is only at later stages that these representations change due to the increasing severity of motor symptoms ([9,47,77]; although see [23]). Ultimately, while sensorimotor representations of mental states may still be intact in the early stages of PD, our results show that deficits in ToM functioning can occur even after very short-term perturbations of dopamine transmission, presumably due to the disruption of mechanisms unrelated to action representation processes.

There are some limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from the current study. First, while animations tasks have been widely used to probe sociocognitive processes due to their ability to reliably distinguish between clinical and control groups [30], it can be argued that their ecological validity is limited compared to experimental designs involving realistic social interactions. Real-world social situations give rise to a multitude of clues to others’ mental states, including facial expressions, tone of voice, and content of verbalisations, and involve repeated interactions—all of which the present task is not designed to index. While the dopaminergic modulation of mentalising during recursive social interactions has been investigated, for instance, using multiround economic games [16,17], future work could expand on the existing results by investigating how dopamine modulates the attribution of mental states to human agents in face-to-face interactions. Moreover, while previous work suggests that dopamine may modulate mental state representation (given its role in model-based reasoning [78]), based on the current data, it cannot be determined whether performance differences are driven by differences in the representation, or mere inference of those mental states [79]. Second, our interpretation that the observed effects of our dopaminergic manipulation in the mental and non-mental state conditions arise from 2 separable neurochemical (i.e., mesolimbic and nigrostriatal) and mechanistic (action representation and reward processing) pathways is based on subsidiary analyses and warrants further investigation using dedicated experimental designs. Computational psychopharmacology and pharmacological fMRI/PET both offer fruitful routes to expanding our current understanding of how dopamine regulates sociocognitive processes. Third, while our results suggest that haloperidol affected mentalising performance independent of working memory function, this does not preclude other aspects of executive function, such as attention, inhibitory control, or cognitive flexibility [80] playing a role in the dopaminergic modulation of mentalising. Finally, dopamine is likely not acting on social function in isolation. Although dopaminergic treatment may benefit sociocognitive function (potentially by reducing suboptimally high dopamine action to more optimal levels), there is growing evidence that the dopaminergic system may work in interaction with the serotonergic system, evidenced, for instance, by reports of therapeutic effects of atypical (acting on both dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors), but not classical (targeting specifically dopamine receptors), antipsychotics on ToM [12,24,81]. Future work is needed to identify the specific contributions of the dopaminergic and serotonergic, and other neuromodulatory systems, to sociocognitive function.

In conclusion, our data causally implicate D2/D3 dopamine in mentalising. Our secondary findings highlight 2 putative pathways via which dopamine disruptions may affect mentalising ability. The present study thus adds further support to a line of research [11,12,82] indicating the potential of dopaminergic treatment in sociocognitive dysfunction, calling to attention the need for further research into the exact neurochemical and computational bases of the dopaminergic modulation of mental state attribution.

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Reviewer #1: This was an well-written, clear, and interesting paper reporting the effects of a D2 DA challenge on theory of mind performance in healthy adults. I am not an expert in either pharmacology nor kinematic analysis, though, I do know about much of the work that has attempted (with varying degrees of success) to connect DA functioning more broadly with theory of mind.

The authors use a relatively novel task within a convincing design (double-blind placebo) to show that DA challenge affects labeling of animations that require mentalizing. The DA challenge also affects the labeling of animations that don't require mentalizing. The effect of DA challenge on mentalizing on non-mentalizing was not statistically distinguishable in the main task. Yet they conclude that DA has a specific effect on mentalizing. This conclusion is based on subsidiary analyses that I didn't think provided empirical support commensurate with the strength of the conclusions.

It was unclear to me what the kinematic analyses showed with respect to the main research question — the authors previously showed that the similarity that one's own movements show to a model's movements predict their accuracy on the mentalizing animations. This effect goes away where in the DA challenge, but they speculate that this is because movements under DA challenge are odd for participants. They show that movement similarity under placebo predicts mentalizing accuracy under DA challenge, but I struggled to see how this shed light on the connection between DA and animation labeling accuracy. I gather that the authors are trying to argue that even though DA affects movement, it's not the effects on movement that are directly affecting their ToM accuracy. But this seems like argument from null and is pretty weak.

More interesting was that DA challenge also affected emotion recognition accuracy in a separate task, and the extent to which it did so for a given participant was weakly correlated with their decrement in performance on the mentalizing animations. The authors speculate that this is evidence for a pathway whereby DA affects social cognition independent of any effects that it might have on other aspects of cognition — they single out executive function as an important example. Perhaps I don't know enough about the movement measures, but since EF is not measured here, it's not clear how this speculation is supported. Do we know that EF is not important for the emotion recognition task used here (I liked, but was new to me), or just not for other emotion recognition tasks generally?

In general, I found these data very interesting, but the strong conclusions not yet warranted.

A minor consideration — there is a small amount of evidence that DA might be related to some aspects of children's theory of mind development (e.g., Lackner et al., 2010; Sabbagh et al., 2012), also independent of whatever effects DA might have on EF. Also, the Savina & Beninger paper comparing the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics (cited near the end of this paper) might provide interesting evidence — taking haloperidol didn't increase ToM performance in this group, but taking clozapine and olanzapine did (without affecting control tasks). I don't know all the pharmacology here (except that I know it's complicated), but it seems like a dissociation worth mentioning in the intro trying to understand current state of the evidence on DA and ToM.

Reviewer #2: This is an interesting study of the effects of a dopamine antagonist on the attribution of intention to moving shapes in healthy adults. The paper makes a case for a causal implication between dopamine and the theory of mind, and that dopaminergic modulation of mental and non-mental state attributions involve distinct pathways.

There are clear strengths in the within-subject design, placebo control, and analysis. The links with motor responses were an interesting hypothesis.

My three primary concerns are that the mental and non-mental state categorisation does not seem to be meaningful, dependent variables were used inconsistently, and a single working memory task is insufficient to rule out general effects on executive function and task performance, as claimed. In the least charitable interpretation, we see that haloperidol reduces computerised task performance, including deducing what might be intended in an animated triangles video and communicating that deduction. In the most charitable interpretation (with potential revisions), we see that a dopamine antagonist, directly or indirectly, may influence the ability to infer mental states, independent of a specific type of working memory. As discussed below, I would not endorse the exploratory analyses based on video categories at this time.

For consideration:

* Animation target words were: 'fighting, following, seducing and surprising'. The experimenters divided these four words into two categories: based on Schuster et al 2021, 'following' and 'fighting' as 'non-mental state' (because there is reciprocal interaction, but supposedly no implication that one character was reading the other triangle's 'mind') and 'seducing' and 'surprising' animations as 'mental state' attributions because one character reacts to the other character's mental state. There is nothing I could find in the paper to justify the classification.

If the label 'mental state' attribution refers to the participant's inference of mental states, then participants could attribute a mental state to 'fighting' and 'following' to at least one, and potentially two triangles in the animation, but these are classified as non-mental state attributions. There is the intentionality of a triangle in each of these concepts, which the participant could infer.

If the label 'mental state' attribution refers to inferring the triangle's inference of mental states, then it is unclear why that would be interesting. Even so, at least one and possibly two triangles are likely to infer the mental state of the other when fighting or following them.

So, what I am trying to say is that an experimental distinction between these categories does not appear to be correct or meaningful.

Without a detailed reading of the methods and a glance at Schuster et al. 2021, a reader could have assumed that 'non-mental state' attribution referred to a variant of the animation task where they moved randomly or in geometric patterns, which would perhaps have been more meaningful. So as a more minor point, the distinction between the conditions should be clearly communicated in the abstract, intro and discussion. These categories are not considered in the introduction at all.

* Unfortunately, I do not agree with the experimenter's conclusion that these results suggest a common dopamine-modulated mechanism among mental state attribution and emotion recognition ability independent of executive function. A single working memory task is insufficient to measure executive function to make any inferences beyond that type of working memory. This is because executive function also involves response inhibition, interference control (e.g., selective attention), and cognitive flexibility. Diamond A. Executive functions. Annu Rev Psychol. 2013;64:135-68.

* Line 324. It is unclear why the inability to compare PLA and HAL trials directly, due to conditions not experiencing the same videos, led to a choice for a very noisy binary measure of accuracy on the triangles task and a new measure of 'percentage accuracy'. With such a noisy measure, a trial in which the target word was rated 99% higher is weighted the same as a trial where it was rated 1% higher than the others. So that is not preferable and it is unclear how this solves the incomparability problem between conditions. In the main analysis, a random intercept was introduced for the animation ID. Why not do that here as well? The disconnect between this exploratory analysis and the main analysis is somewhat troubling and requires further explanation.

* I worry that many of the credibility intervals overlap with zero (all the parameters for model 4.2 in Supp Table 4.3). Does this support the concrete inferences the authors are making? Figure 3 suggests there is not really a strong delineation between mental state attribution categories and correspondence between triangles task performance and emotion recognition performance. The reported stats written in the main text for model 4.2 do not match the stats reported in Supp Table 4.3, which does not reassure that model fitting was done correctly and selectively. I am not commenting further on the Bayesian stats, because they are beyond my expertise, so I hope another reviewer may offer their thoughts on them. They should have specialist (which I am not) reviewer attention before acceptance for publication.

Minor comments:

* Line 328 There are four words in each drug condition, so how do you end up with four percentage accuracy scores and not 8? Presumably, they developed percentage accuracy scores per category…..

* Model results, in tables, may be more appropriate in the main text.

* For the modelling (Line 376), it seems that random intercepts (subject IDs) may have not been included after deciding that they did not contribute to model fit. I would suggest this should be included regardless, as a minimum.

* Line 395: Why are the units of increase in emotion recognition standard deviations, but units of increase of triangles accuracy in %? Why not standardise both? What does '5% increase in their ability' mean when the outcome is a binary variable?

* Line 423-426: The author's phrasing implies a double dissociation, but it should be clear that this is not the case and that inferences should not be made from a negative result.

* The 'causal 'relation claim has been overstated, which could mistakenly be used as a cornerstone of a theory that dopamine directly modulates mentalising. The authors should be ve

REVIEWS:

Reviewer #2: Reviewer comments

The author responses to my earlier comments were excellent, and unless stated otherwise, I find their responses satisfactory. As mentioned before, the study's strengths lie in its within-subject design and robust human pharmacological methods. However, I still have some lingering concerns about the conclusions drawn in this paper. In this follow-up evaluation, I'll address the claims made by the authors in the order presented and the evidence supporting those claims. Some of this may overlap with my previous review if certain points weren't adequately addressed.

Summary:

Each conclusion presents its own set of challenges. The primary conclusion establishes that dopamine manipulation can impact mental state attribution across various animated scenarios, but it lacks significant insight into the underlying mechanism or specificity of effect for social cognition that would take us a significant step forward. On the other hand, the secondary conclusion relies on a questionable distinction between video categories without robust theoretical support for the tests and with questionable statistical inferences. I genuinely wish I could be more positive, but it's challenging to fully endorse the conclusions as they are.

More detail:

We still need a Bayesian's oversight on the confidence intervals question (but also the lack of correction for multiple comparisons).

The primary finding here is the observed decrease in the accuracy of animations labeling with the administration of haloperidol, which suggests a connection to dopamine in Theory of Mind (ToM). After replicating this effect in a mixed model with the shared dataset, I do agree that the basic effect is indeed present. It's great that the authors made some qualifications in the discussion, which I appreciate.

However, the primary claim of a causal role in ToM still takes the spotlight in the abstract. It might be helpful to acknowledge that this assertion could potentially mislead readers, as we discussed in my previous review. Since there isn't enough evidence to directly link dopamine modulation to ToM, it's important to be cautious in interpreting the findings and adjust the language accordingly throughout the manuscript. For example, using phrasing in the abstract similar to the later statement on lines 437-439 "Our findings thus demonstrate that dopaminergic pathways impact [changed from involved in] Theory of Mind, at least indirectly," would more accurately reflect the scope of the evidence presented.

I also noticed that some labels in the provided dataset aren't very clear. It might be beneficial to include a glossary to explain terms like 'Halday' and 'drugday' to avoid any confusion, especially since their distinctions remain ambiguous despite differences in values, and accuracy differences aren't apparent in the datasets.

With these adjustments made throughout the manuscript, the conclusion becomes acceptable. However, standing alone, I'm not entirely convinced it meets the criteria of exceptional importance and interest to scientists set by PLOS. We can probably assume even without this experiment that dopamine manipulations affecting cognition (like attention, motivation, and learning) will impact ToM tasks. So, the paper's significance might hinge on uncovering the mechanisms behind dopamine's impact, which the authors attempt to demonstrate with limited success in the secondary analyses. Other reviewers may disagree. Some might believe that it is important to confirm that there is an effect, even though it is likely there would be.

The secondary conclusion is that 'dopamine modulates inference from mental- and non-mental state animations via independent mechanisms' based on two lines of work. It seems like the authors are diving into some exploratory territory, which can be exciting but also raises some conventional but considerable questions. For instance, why would our motor responses or emotion recognition be more relevant to understanding intentions in the 'mental state' category compared to the 'non-mental state' one? It's not immediately clear from a theoretical standpoint. Moreover, the Bayesian approach also makes it difficult to control for multiple comparisons.

The first claim is that haloperidol diminishes the specificity of motor similarity use for the 'mental state' category attribution accuracy. This diminishing effect is considered by the authors to be a specific reduction of the use of 'motor similarity' for the 'mental state' condition (a contrast between PLA and HAL). Was that comparison done? I could not find it.

For consideration, I tested the reported 3-way interaction with a (frequentist) linear mixed model equivalent of the analysis, and it is not significant (p = 0.076, regardless of method). Frustratingly, there is no way to provide a regression table in a review. It becomes less significant if the mental state is added as a random slope or if the video is not a random grouping factor (this is not the best fitting model presumably, but it just suggests the finding may not be the most reliable). So, I consider this effect with some skepticism, but there is probably a trend effect here. I do not wish to open a Bayesian vs frequentist debate; I just think the authors and editors consider that the two statistical approaches disagree, and what should a reader do with that information when the study was not preregistered.

Now, onto the graphs. I noticed something interesting in Figure 2—the jerk difference in the 'mental state' condition seems to hit a ceiling around z = 5.3, while the 'non-mental state' condition doesn't show the same pattern. What's going on there? Does this difference in distribution affect the analysis?

On lines 341-347 (Model 3, placebo jerk), the authors suggest that due to the absence of an interaction [between jerk difference (motor similarity), mental state, and drug], an effect of placebo jerk difference on mental state animations can be inferred for both placebo (PLA) and haloperidol (HAL) trials. Specifically, they suggest that under haloperidol administration, participants' attribution accuracy is influenced by their movements in the placebo condition rather than movements produced under the drug condition. The authors do need to be careful here. The absence of a difference between HAL and PLA conditions does not signify their equivalence. As proponents of Bayesian analysis, the authors could ascertain whether sufficient evidence exists for the absence of a difference between PLA and HAL conditions to make that inference. Additionally, an investigation solely within the HAL condition to determine if placebo-jerk difference serves as a significantly superior predictor compared to HAL-jerk difference is warranted. As it stands, Figure 2C looks very similar to Figure 2B. By completing those analyses the authors could solidify their conclusions: that HAL-treated participants rely more on placebo-based motor inferences than HAL-based ones, and similar to placebo.

Including HAL jerk differences in the online data could really help when it comes to reviewing the information more closely.

Another point of the authors supporting the claim about two different paths is the connection to emotion regulation. On line 383, the authors mention, "If we see specific changes in how drugs affect recognizing emotions and understanding mental states, but not for non-mental state animations, it could show how dopamine affects our social understanding." However, I respectfully disagree with this because both types of videos likely involve our social understanding, as I noted in my earlier review.

When we look at the secondary analyses together, it seems that haloperidol mainly affects the 'mental state' category and related measures. This includes both individual differences in how we perceive ourselves and others, as well as recognizing emotions. Initially, I thought the abstract suggested they found separate effects for each category, but it turns out they both hinge on distinguishing between 'mental state' and 'non-mental state'. Could it be that haloperidol affects motivation or effort rather than independent mechanisms? Especially since the 'mental state' category is known to be more challenging and might require more focus?

My more fundamental issue with the secondary conclusions is that both categories require understanding mental states, and the line between them isn't clear. The authors did a great job summarizing previous research on these conditions. While I can see that they might involve subtly different levels of mentalizing, labeling them as 'mental state' and 'non-mental state' will cause confusion. Typically, the literature compares tasks involving mentalizing to those that don't, rather than two tasks with slight differences in mentalizing. Also, given that both categories involve inferring mental states, it might be misleading to suggest that 'non-mental state' tasks don't involve understanding others' minds. This is what is implied by the authors on line 383 (that only one category involves social cognition).

My main concern is that there doesn't seem to be a clear theoretical difference between the categories. Without well-defined criteria, it's hard to claim separate pathways for different categories, as the authors suggest. Instead, the differences in effects might reflect varying levels of effort, attention, or other factors. Upon reflection, it's worth considering that these animation categories differ in various ways, like how the triangles interact, move, and demand attention. These differences might explain why one task is easier than another and its relation to other tasks.

One solution could be to reconsider the labels used or even drop this comparison altogether. It might be best to do so if it's unclear why these categories differ in terms of participants' cognition. That said, I appreciate that the primary finding may not be compelling enough on its own, so the authors may want to try to flesh out what is really different between these video categories, and go from there -- as long as they can justify the results in terms of exploratory analysis (without correction for multiple comparisons, if appropriate etc).

Lastly, regarding the effectiveness of blinding, was there any way to assess this?

On line 41, it might be worth noting that there's no 'published' study on this topic.

Reviewer #3: Thankyou to the authors for responding to all of my comments. I am happy that they have all been addressed.

Reviewer #4:

I have been asked to review this revision with a special focus on the Bayesian analyses. In brief, I thought the analyses were entirely appropriate. You might consider orientating the reader to the nature of you
