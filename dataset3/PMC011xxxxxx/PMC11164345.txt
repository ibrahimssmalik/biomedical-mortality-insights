Background

Environmental risk factors are significant contributors to cancer mortality, which are neglected.

Purpose

This study aimed to estimate the population attributable fraction of cancer mortality due to the environmental risk factors.

Methods

Golestan cohort study is a population-base cohort on 50045 participants between 40–75 with about 18 years of follow up. We detected 2,196 cancer mortality and applied a multiple Cox model to compute the hazard ratio of environmental risk factor on all cancer and cancer-specific mortality. The population attributable fraction was calculated, accordingly.

Results

Biomass fuels for cooking, as an indoor air pollution, increased the risk of colorectal, esophageal, gastric cancer, and all-cancer mortality by 84%, 66%, 37%, and 17% respectively. Using gas for cooking, particularly in rural areas, could save 6% [Population Attributable Fraction: 6.36(95%CI: 1.82, 10.70)] of esophageal cancer, 3% [Population Attributable Fraction: 3.43 (0, 7.33)] of gastric cancer, and 6% [Population Attributable Fraction: 6.25 (1.76, 13.63)] of colorectal cancer mortality. Using a healthy tap water source could save 5% [Population Attributable Fraction:5.50(0, 10.93)] of esophageal cancer mortality, particularly in rural areas. There was no significant association between indoor air pollution for heating purposes and animal contact with cancer mortality.

Conclusion

Considering the results of this study, eliminating solid fuel for most daily usage, among the population with specific cancer types, is required to successfully reduce cancer related mortality. Adopting appropriate strategies and interventions by policymakers such as educating the population, allocating resources for improving the healthy environment of the community, and cancer screening policies among susceptible populations could reduce cancer related mortalities.

pmcIntroduction

Globally, cancer is the second cause of mortality and the number of cancer patients worldwide is expected to double in the next 50 years [1, 2]. The number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to all cancer has been gradually rising over the past two decades [3]. 8.97 million deaths were caused by cancer, accounting for 15.8% of all-cause mortality [4]. The growing incidence and burden of cancers in the past decades demands thorough investigation of cancers and the epidemiology of responsible risk factors [5].

The overall impact of environmental risk factors on cancer can be measured by either the number of attributable cancer cases or the number of attributable cancer deaths. Worldwide, it is estimated that around 20% of premature cancer deaths are due to environmental risk factors. In Europe, almost 9% of all cancer deaths in 2019 were estimated to be attributable to this group of risk factors Additionally, environmental risks were responsible for more than 5% of cancer deaths in several European countries [6]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has identified a significant number of modifiable factors, including indoor pollutants from burning coal, as known human carcinogens [7, 8]. About 3 billion people worldwide are affected by indoor air pollution (IAP), which is mostly caused by the use of solid fuels for cooking and heating. This has a significant negative impact on health, including cancers [9]. Although generally environmental risk factors are known to be non-modifiable, the effects of some of these risks could be limited by making changes in the environment and place of living, especially regarding risks like household air pollution which could be significantly controlled by improving in-house fuel used for cooking, heating, or other purposes [10]. These statistics highlight the importance of addressing environmental and occupational risk factors for cancer through evidence-based interventions.

It is crucial to implement strategies that modify behaviors, settings, processes, regulations, and policies to reduce exposure to environmental risk factors, particularly in low middle income countries (LMIC) in which the effect of environmental risk factors on burden of disease is significant, and this major issue is neglected principally in vulnerable groups [11]. By doing so, the prevalence of these risk factors can be reduced, leading to a decrease in the number of future cancer mortality. The population attributable fraction (PAF), which is the percentage of mortality that is attributable to that exposure, can be used to evaluate the public health impact of specific exposures on disease mortality. [12] The PAF is an appropriate epidemiologic measure to be considered by policymakers for prioritizing the preventive strategies and interventions based on the percentage of mortality saved by modifying a risk factor.

In this study, we aimed to calculate the population attributable fraction of environmental risk factors on cancer mortality in a large population-based cohort study with about 18 years of follow up which is settled in a LMIC to provide evidence for policy implication. The main findings of this study were outlining the patterns of predominant fuel use, water source, and animal contact in the cohort study and the share of mortality of each major cancer attributable to the corresponding type of each environmental risk factor.

Materials and methods

Study population

The Golestan Cohort Study (GCS) is a population-based cohort study that aimed to evaluate the environmental and lifestyle risk factors for cancer in Golestan Province, Iran. The study population consisted of 50,045 individuals aged 40 to 75 years, who were recruited over a period of 4 years (2004–2008). The rural participants were all eligible people living in 326 villages of GCS and were recruited through the primary health care network, while the urban participants were recruited based on random systematic clustering using household numbers. Participants who were diagnosed with cancer before enrollment, those who were unwilling or unable to proceed to the study, were excluded. All participants provided a written informed consent, and the Ethical committee of Digestive Disease Research Institute of Tehran University of Medical Sciences approved the study. More details can be found elsewhere [13]. Since enrollment, all GCS participants have been actively followed-up for endpoints by annual telephone surveys and home visits. In this study, we included all 2,196 individuals who died of cancer during the 18 years of follow-up from any type of cancer to calculate population attributable fraction of environmental risk factors.

Data gathering

Qualified experts collected information on lifestyle, and environmental factors, including the most common fuels used for cooking and heating, current and former animal contact, and water source. The experts used valid standardized questionnaires to gather data on various demographic variables, such as age, gender, place of residence, level of education, and socioeconomic status (SES). Possession of a property, house size and design, car ownership, and ownership of appliances like televisions, refrigerators, freezers, vacuum cleaners, or washing machines were used to calculate SES. The detailed method was previously described [14]. The questionnaires also assessed lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, opium use, alcohol consumption, and physical activity, as well as medical history, age of diagnosis, and medical treatments. All questionnaires were validated through a pilot study, and the details of the validation process were previously published [15].

Assessment of the main exposure

In the Golestan Cohort Study, a variety of fuels were examined as environmental risk factors, including natural gas (liquefied petroleum gas), kerosene, and biomass fuels such as wood and animal dung. Participants were individually queried about the types of fuels they used in their homes for cooking and heating throughout their lifetime, as well as the age at which they began and, if applicable, stopped using each fuel. Exposure to indoor air pollution was defined as the use of non-gas fuels without chimneys in households. Participants were categorized based on their predominant fuel use into three groups: "predominant biomass," "predominant kerosene," and "predominant gas." A mixed fuel category was established when no single fuel consumption accounted for more than 60% of the total assignment over a 20-year period. More detail on the categorization can be found elsewhere [8]. Animal contact in the study referred to daily interactions with ruminant animals such as cows, sheep, or goats, including activities like working with or being in proximity to these animals. Water source exposure pertained to the origin of drinking water. Participants were evaluated for their history of consuming unpiped water, typically obtained from wells or rivers. Categorization of participants was based on their exposure to drinking un-piped water, distinguishing between "never exposed" and "continued exposure" [16].

Follow-up and outcome assessment

Each participant was followed up annually through phone calls and home visits from 2004 to November 2022. The loss to follow-up was less than one percent, indicating a high retention rate. For cancer incidence cases, the study team conducted home visits and collected relevant medical records. The diagnosis was confirmed by two independent physicians, and in cases of discrepancies, a third expert opinion was sought. To ensure accurate classification of cancers, the data from the Golestan Cohort Study was matched with the Golestan population-based cancer registry [8]. In the event of a reported death, clinical or hospital records were collected, and if necessary, a verbal examination was conducted. The 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes were used in the Golestan Cohort Study to classify cancer cases. Participants who died from esophageal cancer (ICD-10 Codes: C15), stomach cancer (C16), colorectal cancer (C18-C20), pancreas cancer (C25), Hematologic cancers(C81-C96), lung cancer (C34), and brain cancer (C71) were included in the study, while participants who were diagnosed with cancer at baseline (i.e. the first two years of the follow up) were excluded.

Statistical analysis

The hazard ratio (HR) of household use of fuel, animal contact, and water source and all-cancer mortality, and specific cause cancer mortality was estimated separately using Cox proportional hazards regression models, which also provided the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

The entry time was defined as the enrollment date and end of follow-up time was set at death date due to cancer. The HR of mortality associated with environmental risk factor, was adjusted for age, gender, education, SES, residence (rural/urban), smoking cigarettes, opium consumption, alcohol consumption. Due to importance of residence in rural and urban context, stratification was also implied to report the hazard and PAF in each context. More adjustment for other potential covariates such as healthy index score, energy intake, metastasis status, and indoor or outdoor job did not have any impact on the results, consequently were not included in modeling. We also excluded the first two years of follow-up to avoid potential reverse causality.

Based on the main model, the following equation was used to calculate the population attributable fraction: PAHF(t)=p(HR(t)−1)1+p(HR(t)−1)

This formula corresponds to the traditional PAF formula, where Relative Risk (RR) is replaced by HR (t) obtained from survival models [17]. PUNAFCC command (the Stata package: Population Attributable and Non-attributable Fractions in Case Control or Survival Studies) was used to calculate PAF and according uncertainty intervals for survival analysis [18]. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata statistical software version 14 (Stata Corp).

Results

Baseline characteristics

From 50,045 participants in Golestan Cohort, 211 of them were diagnosed with cancer when entered the study, which 61 did not have complete information of their disease or of the variables we were investigating, so 49,773 participants of whom 2,196 were deceased from cancer were enrolled in this study. Of all participants, 28,685 (57.56%) were female and 21,149 (42.44%) were male. Most of them 39,866 (80%) lived in rural areas and others 9,968 (20%) lived in urban areas. The vast majority, 41,728 (84.76) used gas as their main fuel for cooking, and as for heating only 5,839 (11.86%) used gas. The main fuel for heating was Kerosene used by 35,486 (72.08) individuals. About 45 percent (22,800) of participant had former contact and 6.72% (3,346) had no animal contact in their life. 8,419 (16.91%) of participants did not have access to tap water source in their life. Gastrointestinal (GI) Cancer patients had the highest mortality with 1,099 deaths after about 18 years of follow up followed by hematologic cancer (166), lung cancer (159), and brain cancer (79). The majority of deceased cancer patients aged between 55 and 64 except for brain cancer which was a decade earlier. Most cancer deaths were reported in male participants particularly, lung and stomach cancer. This pattern is reverse in brain cancer. Mortality of cancer is higher in individuals with low score of wealth among all type of cancer except for colorectal and hematologic cancers. The prominent fuel used for cooking and heating is gas and kerosene in all cancer type, respectively. Biomass use is higher than kerosene use in stomach and esophagus cancer deaths in both cooking and heating purpose, but is in third level in other cancers. Higher amount of former animal contact is reported among stomach and colorectal cancer deaths comparing to other cancer types. More detail could be found on Table 1.

HR and PAF of environmental risk factors on all-cancer mortality

Among indoor air pollution, biomass use in cooking purpose is associated with increased risk of all-cancer mortality with HR 1.17 (95%CI: 1, 1.38) compared to gas. However, other type of fuel for cooking and heating purpose had no association with all-cancer mortality. Of total cancer deaths, 1.26% (95% CI: 0, 2.64) were attributable to biomass use as fuel for cooking purposes.

This means that about 26 deaths from cancer could be prevented if biomass is eliminated for cooking purpose. There was no significant association between animal contact and type of water source as environmental risk factors with all-cancer mortality. There is no significant association found in rural and urban residence between exposures and mortality (Table 2).

HR and PAF of environmental risk factors on GI cancer mortality

Predominant biomass use for cooking was associated with higher risk of esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancer mortality with HR: 1.66 (95% CI: 1.22, 2.26), 1.37 (1, 1.92), 1.84 (1, 3.42), respectively. There is no association between kerosene use and risk of GI cancer mortality. The estimated PAF for biomass was slightly higher among esophageal cancer 5.70 (1.53, 9.69) comparing to gastric cancer 3.01 (0, 6.45). Eliminating biomass for cooking purpose could reduce about 23 and 13 deaths from esophageal and gastric cancer. Although biomass was associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer mortality, but the respective PAF was not significant. Moreover, no association was found between different type of fuel use as indoor pollution for heating propose and GI cancer mortality. Using non-tap water source is associated with higher risk of esophageal cancer mortality with HR 1.26 (1.00, 1.58), and PAF: 5.01 (0, 10.03), saving about 21 deaths by using healthy tap water source. Hence, there is no association reported with other type of GI cancer mortality. There is no association between animal contact and GI cancer mortality (Table 3).

In rural area, biomass use for cooking propose was associated with higher risk of esophageal cancer mortality [HR: 1.69(1.24, 2.30), PAF: 6.36(1.82, 10.70)], gastric cancer mortality [HR: 1.38 (1, 1.93), PAF: 3.43 (0, 7.33)], and colorectal cancer [HR: 1.88(1.00, 3.53), PAF: 6.25 (1.76, 13.63)]. This pattern is not seen in urban area. Moreover, non-tap water source is associated with higher risk of mortality in esophageal cancer [HR: 1.26(1.01,1.59), PAF:5.50(0, 10.93)]. There was no association in urban area between environmental risk factors and cancer mortality. In addition, no association was found between environmental risk factors and pancreatic cancer mortality.

HR and PAF of environmental risk factors on non-GI cancer mortality

Among included non-GI cancers, hematologic cancers, lung cancer, and brain cancer had the highest mortality number, respectively. However, the mentioned cancers’ mortality was low comparing to GI mortality. Consequently, the estimated hazard and PAF for environmental risk factors were prone to wide uncertainties. Among, included environmental risk factors, biomass use for cooking in urban area with HR:7.29(1, 53.92) was associated with higher risk of hematologic cancer mortality but the associated PAF was non-significant due to low prevalence of exposure in the study. Moreover, mixed fuel use for cooking is associated with higher risk of lung cancer mortality with HR: 1.92(1.10,3.36), PAF: 4.76%(0, 9.85). The HR [2.85(1, 8.13)] was also significant in urban area but not the PAF [6.88(-3.99,16.62)].

Discussion

This study estimated the population attributable fraction of cancers due to environmental risk factors. The main finding of this study was a significant reduction in cancer-related mortality when biomass fuel, as an indoor air pollution, was replaced with gas for cooking purpose, particularly in GI cancers. Prominent use of biomass for cooking purpose increased 84%, 66%, and 37% the risk of colorectal, esophageal, and gastric cancer mortality, respectively. About 6 percent of esophageal cancer, 3% of gastric cancer, 6% of colorectal cancer mortality would be saved by eliminating non-gas fuel for cooking particularly in rural area. Using healthy piped water source could save 5% of esophageal cancer mortality, particularly in rural area. We could not find any significant association between indoor air pollution for heating purpose or animal contact with cancer mortality. Although, accessing sufficient healthcare facilities and quality treatment is a challenge for those living in rural areas, controlling environmental risk factors could potentially reduce mortality in both rural and urban regions [19].

Indoor air pollution from solid fuels is a major risk of respiratory tract and other organs diseases and cancers, especially when solid fuels are used in poorly ventilated spaces in which toxic emissions from combustion accumulate and increase the risk of diseases [20]. The aforementioned situation of using solid fuels in poorly ventilated places mainly happens in developing and low- and middle-income countries, where poor housing structures exist and solid fuels are still extensively used to heat the living place and for cooking purposes [21]. The contribution of indoor air pollution from solid fuels to lung cancer and other respiratory cancers like those arising from larynx, hypopharynx, tracheal, and bronchus is demonstrated previously [22]. Moreover, in low-income population, biomass smoke is a risk factor for esophageal and gastric cancer [8]. A meta-analysis of literature found higher risk of upper-digestive tract and cervical cancer associated with household air pollution, while the results were adjusted for other risks like smoking [23]. Studies have shown associations between certain types of air pollution and brain cancer [24, 25]. Besides, some studies have reported associations between indoor air pollution from solid fuels and other neurologic conditions and cognitive impairments, which altogether suggests the neurologically toxic impact of the emissions of solid fuels on human brain and neurologic system [26–28]. In this study, we did not observe any impact of indoor air pollution on the mortality rate of brain cancer patients. Among hematologic malignancies, studies reported associations between indoor pollutants of nitrogen dioxide and several types of volatile organic compounds and incidence of childhood acute leukemia [26, 29]. It is suggested that various environmental pollutants added to immunologic factors and genetic susceptibility may expose to leukemia [30, 31]. Parallel to other studies, we observed that the use of solid fuels for cooking purpose had a significant impact on esophageal, gastric, colorectal, lung, and hematologic cancer related mortality particularly in individuals living in rural areas. By implementing appropriate interventions to minimize the application of solid fuel by society, 1% of all-cancer, 6% of esophageal, 3% of gastric, and 6% of colorectal cancer deaths would be averted, adjusted for confounders including socioeconomic status. This has great impact on the burden of cancers in LMIC which are struggling with the health inequities.

According to several studies, there is an apparent excess risk of all-cancer mortality among cities that use surface drinking water supplies, with the increased risk being slight but statistically significant, while the results of recent studies do not appear to implicate drinking water as a factor in causing considerably higher cancer mortality rates in cities, and the gastric cancer mortality rate is higher among those who drink river water than those who drink shallow well water [32–34]. A study by the Environmental Working Group found that millions of Americans are drinking water containing carcinogens, and the contamination may be responsible for more than 100,000 cases of cancer. The strongest evidence for a cancer risk involves arsenic, which is linked to cancers of the liver, lung, bladder, and kidney [35, 36]. In LMIC, the relationship between water source and cancer mortality is not extensively studied. This indicates a gap in research in these regions. However, the available previous evidence suggests that water source can potentially impact cancer mortality rates. This study implemented in a LMIC for the first time suggested association between water source and esophageal cancer, which is parallel to available evidence from developed countries.

Epidemiologic studies to date have provided little evidence that animal viruses and bacteria cause human cancer, although exposure to farm animals or manure has been associated with childhood brain and adult hematologic tumors in some studies [37, 38]. Overall, the available search results do not provide clear evidence on the relationship between animal contact and cancer mortality in humans. This study did not find any association between animal contact and any type of cancer mortality.

Iran, as a LMIC, faced a dramatic change in the burden of cancer and exposure to environmental risk factors in recent years. Exposures like indoor air pollution due to solid fuels have decreased substantially with wide-spread improvements in gas piping system through the country in this period [39, 40]. However, the use of biomass and solid fuels still is the only option in some regions of the country with limited resources [40]. Public health implications of the findings of this study could be focused on the populations with significant exposure to indoor air pollutants due to solid fuels and provide more cancer screening programs for them. Also, continuing efforts to decrease solid fuel use for heating, and cooking especially in settings with limited and inadequate ventilation need to be pursued to handle the burden of cancers associated with the toxic emissions of these sources of energy. To reduce the burden of cancer, it is crucial to implement evidence-based and comprehensive cancer prevention strategies that target modifiable risk factors. These strategies can include public policies, health-promoting environments, personal and community interventions, and optimized health service. By implementing interventions that target these risk factors, it is possible to make significant progress in reducing the number of cancer mortalities [41]. Reducing the environmental risk factors that affect cancer mortality requires a multi-faceted approach [42]. First, allocating sufficient resources by regulations to prevent exposure (including occupational) and reducing pollution. Stakeholders should allocate resources to mitigate or eliminate barriers to reducing environmental cancer risks. Second, changing behaviors can also reduce environmental and occupational cancer risk. Policies should be implemented to provide education and awareness to the public about the environmental risk factors that can cause cancer. This can include information about how to reduce exposure to indoor air pollution and how to identify hazardous substances. Third, providing access to clean water should be implemented to ensure that all populations have access to clean water sources. Fourth, conducting research on the environmental risk factors that can cause cancer. This can include identifying the sources, magnitude, routes of exposure, and distribution of these risk factors. Measuring the potential cancer mortality related to environmental hazard exposure can benefit to update efforts to modify health of communities. Finally, environmental justices are necessary and one of the social determinants of health which is neglected particularly in LMIC. The underprivileged population should be priories in implementation of policies which reduce the unique or compounded health risks. By implementing these policy strategies, it is possible to minimize environmental risk factors that affect cancer mortality and reduce the burden of cancer. However, it is important to prioritize efforts and focus on equity when implementing cancer prevention strategies. This ensures that interventions reach all populations, including vulnerable and marginalized groups, and that resources are allocated appropriately. Timely implementation, focus on equity, and prioritization of efforts are associated with public health and economic benefits. Detecting the level of awareness of cancer risk among high risk groups is essential for achieving health equity. Providing access to screening for people who are medically underserved and have low incomes, studying the cost of preventive care and cancer treatment, and the reasons people may not be able to prevent cancer, early detection, and treatment are other ways to achieve equity.

The strength of this study is its extensive follow-up of a large population based cohort with detailed risk factor assessments, and low rates of loss to follow-up which enable us to calculate precise estimations. Furthermore, this study is among the first to assessing the proportion of cancer mortality attributed to environmental risk factors in a LMIC. However, we could not assess the quantitative markers of indoor air pollution, such as the amount of natural carcinogenic chemicals produced by burning fuel in the household air as the data were not available. In this study, the adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) was used to estimate Population Attributable Fraction (PAF). however, other variables such as access to facilities, first diagnosis, and treatment may have an impact on the prevalence and hazard ratios. we used socioeconomic status and urbanization as a proxy for health care access as they have correlation, hence, future research should investigate these factors in further studies. Moreover, there are other sources of indoor pollution that were not assessed in this cohort study. Bakhoor and other types of incense pose adverse health effects when used indoors, particularly in locations with inadequate ventilation. These suggested to be considered in future cohort studies.

Conclusions

To conclude, the effect of environmental risk factors is significant with substantial number of cancer mortality attributable to these risk factors. This study found significant associations between certain types of cancers and exposure to indoor air pollution and unsafe water source, based on a population-based cohort study in Iran. GI cancer showed to have strong associations with fuel and water source, especially among rural residents, which are more exposed to solid fuels use in Iran. Adopting appropriate strategies and interventions such as educating population, allocating resources for improving healthy environment of the community, and cancer screening polices among susceptible populations and decreasing exposure to solid fuels is suggested to be adopted by stakeholders and policymaker to reduce cancer mortality.

Reviewer #1: Population Attributable Fractions of Cancer Mortality Related to Environmental Risk Factors: The Golestan Cohort Study

This article entitled: Population Attributable Fractions of Cancer Mortality Related to Environmental Risk Factors: The Golestan Cohort Study, seems an interesting topic that provides another face of environmental risk factors related to cancer mortality.

Some comments may need to be reviewed and answered.

1- The abstract showed no conclusion as a subheading.

2- On page 7, within the methodology section under "Follow-Up and Outcome Assessment," at line 138: It's essential to specify the time frame for follow-up in this section, indicating when it commenced and over how many years it extended. Furthermore, clarification is needed regarding whether participants encompassed both cancer and non-cancer patients.

3- On page 9, within the Statistical Analysis section, at line 169: Abbreviations like RR and PUNAFCC were not sufficiently defined for clarity.

4- On page 10, in the results section, at line 188: Is the elevated cancer mortality rate among individuals with low wealth attributed to limited access to specialized cancer treatment centers in rural areas, leading to inadequate monitoring of patient status compared to those residing in urban areas within the studied demographic?

Should late diagnosis be considered a factor more significant than environmental factors?

5- The primary findings of this study necessitate adjustments to clinical services to guarantee timely access to sufficient healthcare facilities and top-notch diagnosis and treatment. It's important to note that individuals in rural areas frequently encounter difficulties in accessing such services.

6- On page 16, within the discussion section, at line 264: The indicated 6% may require comparison with the figures presented in the selected table.

7- On page 16, in the discussion section, at line 284: The limited influence of indoor pollution on brain cancer, as observed in this study, may be associated with the metastatic progression of the disease, particularly evident in advanced-stage cases.

8- On page 17, in the discussion section, at line 289: Consistent with prior research, our findings indicate that the utilization of solid fuels for cooking is notably associated with higher mortality rates linked to esophageal, gastric, colorectal, lung, and hematologic cancers, especially among individuals residing in rural regions. This observation suggests that those who rely on solid fuels for cooking are often of lower socioeconomic status and likely face challenges accessing adequate healthcare facilities for optimal diagnosis and follow-up. Therefore, these findings appear to be more closely linked to the accessibility of healthcare services rather than solely to environmental factors.

9-

Page 20, line 357: why the author did not mentioned the role of facility use as indicator to delay mortality as well as lead to early diagnosis to avoid this type of confounder on the given findings.

Alternatively, could the author elaborate on whether Bahkoor and other types of incense pose adverse health effects when used indoors, particularly in locations with inadequate ventilation?

Reviewer #2: Title:

Population Attributable Fractions of Cancer Mortality Related to Environmental Risk Factors: The Golestan Cohort Study

Since cancer is the major health challenge globally, i would like to thank the authors for drafting this manuscript. The manuscript is well organized and scientifically sounds for publication. Please find my concerns below.

Concern one on title: The phrase “environmental factors” are more general as compared to environmental risk factors attributable to cancer mortality included in this study. It is very difficult to include all environmental risk factors attributable to cancer mortality in this study. Hence, this needs to be justified and/or modification of the title.

Concern two: Abstract discussion Section: It is not recommended to add discussion in the abstract section. Instead it is highly advisable to include conclusion and highlight of the recommendation section about what to do to reduce cancer mortality as a result of exposure to various environmental risk factors.

Concern Three: introduction section: Line 59-60: “Worldwide, it is estimated 60 that around 20% of premature cancer deaths are due to environmental risk factors” If this is known, what is the unknown here? Please provide your justification.

Concern: four Introduction section: Is there similar articles published before? Or is it the only study on the issue? If there is previous similar work, what was the gap the authors identified and wants to fill, so that the international community can gain new insights?

Concern Five: How cofounders can practically be controlled. A cancer patient may be died during follow up period because of other co-morbidities.

residing in urban areas within the studied demographic?

Should late diagnosis be considered a factor more significant than environmental factors?

Response: It is an insightful comment. It is the reason that in this study the HR and PAF for Rural and Urban areas were calculated separately. Also, HR is calculated by adjusting other confounders including SES (Social Economic Status) and urbanization as discussed in the method section to minimize this confounding effect of the factors and evaluating HR of environmental factors adjusted for mentioned confounders. In addition, the metastasis was included as a potential confounder in modeling and did not change the results. This is added in the method section.

Comment 5: The primary findings of this study necessitate adjustments to clinical services to guarantee timely access to sufficient healthcare facilities and top-notch diagnosis and treatment. It's important to note that individuals in rural areas frequently encounter difficulties in accessing such services.

Response: The authors agree. Based on the aim of the study, we conclude that although access to services may affect the mortality rate in rural regions, controlling environmental risk factors could potentially reduce mortality in both rural and urban regions. Also, we added the mentioned note in the discussion section. Also, we cited a paper as a reference.

Comment 6: On page 16, within the discussion section, at line 264: The indicated 6% may require comparison with the figures presented in the selected table.

Response: We have commented and highlighted the related reports in the result section. This is the PAF of each cancer in rural areas and there is no figure to compare.

Comment 7: On page 16, in the discussion section, at line 284: The limited influence of indoor pollution on brain cancer, as observed in this study, may be associated with the metastatic progression of the disease, particularly evident in advanced-stage cases.

Response:

Based on the results, the authors didn't observe the impact of indoor pollution on brain cancer patient mortality rates. In addition, the adjusted HR is calculated for the metastasis variable and we added this in the method section. The results were not changed. So, we didn’t include them in the final model.

Comment 8: On page 17, in the discussion section, at line 289: Consistent with prior research, our findings indicate that the utilization of solid fuels for cooking is notably associated with higher mortality rates linked to esophageal, gastric, colorectal, lung, and hematologic cancers, especially among individuals residing in rural regions. This observation suggests that those who rely on solid fuels for cooking are often of lower socioeconomic status and likely face challenges accessing adequate healthcare facilities for optimal diagnosis and follow-up. Therefore, these findings appear to be more closely linked to the accessibility of healthcare services rather than solely to environmental factors.

Response: Thanks for the insightful comment. As the reviewer correctly indicated there is an association between SES and healthcare access which is why we used SES as an indicator in our modeling to adjust the confounding effect of this on the effect of environmental factors on mortality. In the modeling, all available confounder variables were added to the model to minimize the effect of other confounder factors like SES on the final HR of environmental factors. The effect reported in this study is adjusted for not only SES, but stratified for Rural and Urban which both correlate with healthcare access and all the according benefits like early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the effect reported for environmental factors addresses all above mentioned confounding effects. In this part of the discussion, we just describe the associations in low-middle-income countries. We have added more clarification on this in the discussion section.

Comment 9: Page 20, line 357: why the author did not mention the role of facility use as an indicator to delay mortality as well as lead to early diagnosis to avoid this type of confounder on the given findings?

Response:

Thank you for your comment. As the reviewer correctly indicated there is an association between SES and healthcare access and use which is why we used SES as an indicator in our modeling to adjust the confounding effect of this on the effect of environmental factors on mortality. In the modeling, all available confounder variables were added to the model to minimize the effect of other confounder factors like SES on the final HR of environmental factors. The effect reported in this study is adjusted for not only SES, but stratified for Rural and Urban residents which both correlate with health care access and use, and all the benefits like early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the effect reported for environmental factors addresses all above mentioned confounding effects.

Comment 9:

Alternatively, could the author elaborate on whether Bahkoor and other types of incense pose adverse health effects when used indoors, particularly in locations with inadequate ventilation?

The questionnaire didn’t contain any information about the Bahkoor and it is needed to pay attention to it as another source of indoor air pollution.

Response: Thanks for your comment. In the Golestan Cohort study questionnaire, this variable was not measured. As the reviewer correctly indicated this is an important variable and we added this to our limitation and suggested the need for future research on this in discussion.

Reviewer 2:

Comment 1: The phrase “environmental factors” is more general as compared to environmental risk factors attributable to cancer mortality included in this study. It is very difficult to include all environmental risk factors attributable to cancer mortality in this study. Hence, this needs to be justified and/or modification of the title.

Response: With many thanks for this clarifying comment, we changed the title as follows:

“Population Attributable Fractions of Cancer Mortality Related to Indoor Air Pollution, Animal Contact, and Water Source as Environmental Risk Factors: Findings from The Golestan Cohort Study”

Comment 2: Abstract Discussion Section: It is not recommended to add discussion in the abstract section. Instead, it is highly advisable to include a conclusion and highlight the recommendation section about what to do to reduce cancer mortality as a result of exposure to various environmental risk factors.

Response: Thanks for the comment, we revised the abstract by removing the discussion and adding the conclusion.

Comment 3: introduction section: Line 59-60: “Worldwide, it is estimated 60 that around 20% of premature cancer deaths are due to environmental risk factors” If this is known, what is the unknown here? Please provide your justification.

Response: Thanks for the valuable comment which highlights the most important aim of this study, as we have indicated in the introduction, It is crucial to implement strategies that modify behaviors, settings, processes, regulations, and policies to reduce exposure to environmental risk factors, particularly in low middle-income countries (LMIC) in which the effect of environmental risk factors on burden of disease is significant, and this major issue is neglected principally in vulnerable groups. By doing so, the prevalence of these risk factors can be reduced, leading to a decrease in the number of future cancer mortality. The population attributable fraction (PAF), which is the percentage of mortality that is attributable to that exposure in the setting of each country due to different prevalence, can be used to evaluate the public health impact of specific exposures on disease mortality. The PAF is an appropriate epidemiologic measure to be considered by policymakers for prioritizing the preventive strategies and interventions based on the percentage of mortality saved by modifying a risk factor and must be reported based on region prevalence of exposure which highlights the need to have reports in LMIC which is neglected.

In this study, we aimed to calculate the population-attributable fraction of environmental risk factors on cancer mortality in a large population-based cohort study with about 18 years of follow up which is settled in a LMIC to provide evidence for policy implication. This information is provided in the introduction.

Comment 4: four Introduction section: Are there similar articles published before? Or is it the only study on the issue? If there is previous similar work, what was the gap the authors identified and want to fill so that the international community can gain new insights?

Response: Thank you for your insightful comment. While there have been limited studies examining the association of environmental risk factors with cancer mortality, our research is unique in its scope and focus to assess the PAF of environmental risk factors on cancer mortality from a cohort with more than 20 years follow up from a LMIC which is needed for policy implication.

Our study is distinctive in that it calculates the population-attributable fraction of environmental risk factors on cancer mortality within a large population-based cohort study over an extended follow-up period of approximately 18 years. This study is set in a low-to-middle-income country (LMIC), providing a unique perspective and valuable data for policy implications.

The primary findings of our study outline the patterns of predominant fuel use, water source, and animal contact within the cohort study. Furthermore, we have quantified the share of mortality for each major cancer type attributable to the corresponding environmental risk factor.

This approach allows us to identify specific environmental risk factors contributing to cancer mortality in this context, which can guide targeted interventions and policies. Therefore, our study fills a critical gap in the literature by providing comprehensive, long-term data on the population-attributable fraction of environmental risk factors on cancer mortality in an LMIC setting.

Comment 5: How cofounders can practically be controlled. A cancer patient may die during the follow-up period because of other co-morbidities.

Response: Thanks for your comment, in this study, we utilized the Hazard Ratio in the PAF formula, which was estimated using a Cox regression model. This modeling method allowed us to adjust for the effect of confounders. The HR of mortality associated with environmental risk factors was adjusted for age, gender, education, SES, residence (rural/urban), smoking cigarettes, opium consumption, and alcohol consumption. Due to the importance of residence in rural and urban contexts, stratification was also implied to report the hazard and PAF in each context. More adjustments for other potential covariates such as healthy index score, energy intake, and indoor or outdoor job did not have any impact on the results and, consequently were not included in modeling. We also excluded the first two years of follow-up to avoid potential reverse causality. It is important to note that we have included all patients who have died from cancer based on ICD10. In the event of a reported death, clinical or hospital records were collected, and if necessary, a verbal examination was conducted. The 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes was used in the Golestan Cohort Study to classify cancer cases. Participants who died from esophageal cancer (ICD-10 Codes: C15), stomach cancer (C16), colorectal cancer (C18-C20), pancreas cancer (C25), Hematologic cancers(C81-C96), lung cancer (C34), and brain cancer (C71) were included in the study, while participants who were diagnosed with cancer at baseline were excluded. We aim to assess The hazard ratio (HR) of household use of fuel, animal contact, and water source and all-cancer mortality, and specific cause cancer mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression models, which also provided the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Then we used this to estimate PAF. In this case, competitive outcome survival analysis is not applicable due to aim of the this study.
