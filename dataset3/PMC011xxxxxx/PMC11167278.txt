﻿Abstract

Four new species of Marphysa are described from Terengganu state on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, using morphological and molecular (cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene) data. These species belong to different groups of Marphysa: Marphysakertehensissp. nov. belongs to Group A (Mossambica), Marphysamerchangensissp. nov. and Marphysasetiuensesp. nov. belong to Group B (Sanguinea) and Marphysaibaiensissp. nov. belongs to Group E (Gravelyi). Marphysakertehensissp. nov. is characterised by having only limbate chaetae, absence of subacicular hooks, three types of pectinate chaetae including wide, thick isodont with short and slender inner teeth, and pectinate branchiae with up to nine branchial filaments. Marphysamerchangensissp. nov. is characterised by the presence of eyes, unidentate subacicular hooks, four types of pectinate chaetae including wide, thick anodont pectinate chaetae with five long and thick inner teeth, and pectinate branchiae with up to six branchial filaments. Marphysasetiuensesp. nov. has mostly unidentate subacicular hooks (bidentate on several posterior chaetigers), four types of pectinate chaetae including wide, thick anodont pectinate chaetae with seven thick and long inner teeth, and pectinate branchiae with up to five branchial filaments. Marphysaibaiensissp. nov. has bidentate subacicular hooks throughout, five types of pectinate chaetae, including a heterodont with 12 short and slender inner teeth, and pectinate branchiae with up to eight branchial filaments. The designation of these new species based on morphology is fully supported by molecular data. Habitat descriptions of each species are also included.

pmc﻿Introduction

Marphysa de Quatrefages 1866, currently with 83 accepted species, is the second most speciose genus in the family Eunicidae, after the genus Eunice Cuvier, 1817 (Read and Fauchald 2023). Marphysa species inhabit a wide range of habitats, either in soft sediments or rocky ground, from intertidal to shallow subtidal depth, and are commonly found in estuarine or sheltered habitats (Abdullah et al. in review; Zanol et al. 2016; Martin et al. 2020). Three species have recently been described from the deep sea (Lavesque et al. 2023). Taxonomic studies of Marphysa species have increased considerably since the redescription of the type species, M.sanguinea (Montagu, 1813) and the designation of a neotype by Hutchings and Karageorgopoulos (2003); and later by molecular sequencing (Zanol et al. 2010). Since then, many more species have been described or previously synonymised species resurrected, using molecular data and additional morphological characters such as the types and distributions of chaetae.

According to Fauchald (1970) and Glasby and Hutchings (2010), Marphysa can be divided into five informal groups (Groups A–E) depending on their type of chaetae. Group A (Mossambica) without compound chaetae, Group B (Sanguinea) with only compound spinigers present, Group C (Aenea) with only compound falcigers present, Group D (Belli) with both spinigers and falcigers present, and Group E (Teretiuscula; renamed Gravelyi by Molina-Acevedo and Idris 2021) with only compound spinigers and subacicular chaetae in anterior parapodia and limbate chaetae throughout.

In Malaysia, Paxton and Chou (2000) suggested that the low number of polychaete species identified in Malaysia is an underestimate due to the limited sampling of polychaetes. Idris et al. (2014) described Marphysamoribidii Idris, Hutchings & Arshad, 2014 from the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The species is currently the only Marphysa described from Malaysia, occurring in Rhizophora and Sonneratia spp. mangroves. Marphysamoribidii is regularly used as fishing bait by local fishermen. In addition, recent studies (Ee Pei et al. 2020; Rapi et al. 2020; Rosman et al. 2020) reported the potential applications of M.moribidii as a wound-healing agent and bio-catalyst of gold and silver nanoparticles. This study investigated Marphysa species from the mangrove forest on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, specifically Terengganu, as they may also have potential applications similar to M.moribidii. We found four new Marphysa species using an integrated approach to taxonomy, including morphological and molecular analyses.

﻿Materials and methods

﻿Study area and sampling

Marphysa specimens were collected from the rivers, lagoon and estuary of the Terengganu mangrove forests during spring low tides from September 2021 until March 2022. A total of four mangrove areas were chosen, i.e. Setiu wetlands, Kuala Ibai, Merchang, and Kerteh (Fig. 1A, B). At each site, sediments were dug using a shovel to approximately 30 cm depth at several points along the river (upper course to lower course) and carefully broken into small pieces to search for the worms. Worms suspected to be Marphysa were fixed and preserved in 95% ethanol. Sediments where the Marphysa worms were found were also collected and kept in labelled plastic bags for sediment analysis. All material was collected by the first author.

﻿Morphological analyses

Preserved specimens were examined under AmScope SM-2 Series stereo and 120 Series compound microscopes. Additionally, the specimens were also examined under Leica M165 C stereo and Nikon Labophot-2 compound microscopes, and photographed with a Nikon D610 camera at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, USA (NHMLAC). Drawings of parapodia and pectinate chaetae were made using a Wacom Intuos Pro drawing tablet. Length at chaetiger 10 (L10) and width at chaetiger 10 (W10) without parapodia of all specimens were measured and recorded. Morphological terminology, including diagnostic features of Marphysa species, follows Molina-Acevedo and Carrera-Parra (2017). Terminology of pectinate chaetae is derived and modified from Carrera-Parra and Salazar-Vallejo (1998) for the relative length of outer and inner teeth, Zanol et al. (2014, 2016) for the thickness of the blade and Glasby et al. (2019) for the size of the inner teeth: isodont means outer teeth much longer than inner teeth; anodont means outer teeth more or less the same length as inner teeth; heterodont refers to when one long and one short (same length as inner teeth) lateral tooth is present. The thickness of the shaft is thin when it is thinner than the limbate chaetae on the same parapodium, thick when the shaft is as thick or thicker than limbate chaetae on the same parapodium. The width of the pectinate blade is wide when the blade is ≥ 30 μm and narrow below this threshold; length of the inner teeth is long when they are ≥ 12 µm and thick when ≥ 2 µm; below these thresholds, the teeth are defined as short and slender, respectively. Table 1 and Fig. 2 summarises and illustrates the types of pectinate chaetae present in species of Marphysa from Terengganu.

﻿Molecular analyses

Molecular analyses were done at the Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT) and the Australian Museum Research Institute, Australian Museum, Sydney (AMRI). At UMT, extractions of DNA were done using the xanthogenate method (Tillett and Neilan 2000). Approximately 600 bp of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene were amplified using universal primer pair LCO1490 and HCO2198 (Folmer et al. 1994). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplifications were carried out using 12.5 μL of OneTaq Quick-Load Master mix, 9.5 μL of biology grade water, 0.5 μL of primers (10 μM), 1 μL of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 μL DNA template. The temperature profile was as follows: 95 °C / 180 s – (94 °C / 20 s – 45 °C / 30 s – 72 °C / 60 s)*35 cycles and final extension time at 72 °C / 300 s. PCR success was verified by electrophoresis in a 1% p/v agarose gel stained with GelRed. Amplified products were sent to Apical Scientific Sdn. Bhd. for Sanger sequencing using forward primer (LCO1490).

Meanwhile, at AMRI, extractions of DNA were done with an ISOLATE II Genomic DNA kit (BIOLINE) following the protocol supplied by the manufacturers. Approximately 600 bp of COI gene were amplified using primers polyLCO and polyHCO (Carr et al. 2011). PCR was performed with Taq DNA Polymerase QIAGEN Kit in 20 μL mixtures containing: 2 μL of 10× CoralLoad PCR Buffer (final concentration of 1×), 1.5 μL of MgCl2 (25 Mm) solution, 1.5 μL of PCR nucleotide mix (final concentration of 0.2 mM each dNTP), 0.4 μl of each primer (final concentration of 0.2 μM), 0.1 μl of Taq DNA Polymerase (5U/μl), 1 μl template DNA and 13.1 μL of nuclease-free water. The temperature profile was as follows; 94 °C / 60 s – (94 °C / 40 s – 45 °C / 40 s – 72 °C / 60 s)*5 cycles – (94 °C / 40 s – 51 °C/ 40 s – 72 °C / 60 s)*35 cycles – 72 °C / 300 s. PCR success was verified by electrophoresis in a 1% p/v agarose gel stained with GelRed. Amplified products were sent to Macrogen Company for Sanger sequencing using the same set of primers used for PCR.

A total of 63 COI sequences were downloaded from GenBank or obtained during this study; 60 COI sequences of Marphysa species and three outgroup species from closely related genera in the order Eunicida (Table 2). All COI sequences were aligned in MEGA v. 11.0.10 using ClustalW plugin with default settings. The best DNA/Protein Models (ML) test was conducted, and the GTR model of molecular evolution was chosen as the best evolutionary model for the COI gene alignment. The phylogenetic analysis was performed in MEGA v. 11.0.10 (Tamura et al. 2021). The analysis was run for 1000 replicates. Pair-wise Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) genetic distance was performed using MEGA v. 11.0.10.

﻿Habitat description and sediment analyses

Habitats of identified Marphysa were described based on the observations made during sampling including mangrove vegetations and sediment analyses. The particle size of the sediments was determined using dry-sieving techniques. Sediments were oven-dried at 60 °C for ~ 72 h. Then, 100 g of sub-samples were gently dry-sieved through a series of 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.063 mm mesh openings of an Octagon D200 Digital mechanical shaker. Sediments retained on each sieve were weighed and recorded. Sediment grain size was classified according to grain size classifications by Blair and McPherson (1999), modified after Udden (1914) and Wentworth (1922). The percentage of particle size compositions was calculated, and the texture of sediments was determined based on the sediment textural classification scheme of Blair and McPherson (1999), modified after Folk et al. (1970).

Furthermore, total organic matter was determined using the loss on ignition (LOI) method which calculates the weight loss after combustion (Dean 1974). A total of 5 g of oven-dried sediments were placed in ceramic crucibles and ashed at 550 °C for six h in a muffle furnace. Then, sediments were cooled in a desiccator and weighed. The percentage of total organic matter (TOM) was analysed by the percentage loss of weight on ignition at 550 °C.

﻿Results

﻿Molecular analyses

DNA sequences of COI (460 bp) (Fig. 3) were used for phylogenetic analysis based on the maximum likelihood (ML) method. Results based on the COI showed that the four Marphysa species from Terengganu were well separated from other sequences of Marphysa and formed four different clades. Nodal support ranges from 97–100%, showing strong support for the clades. The interspecific divergence between these new species and all their sister taxa pair is high (pair-wise Kimura 2-parameter – COIK2P range from 6.14%–19.16%) (see Suppl. material 1).

﻿Ecological analyses

Particle size analyses of sediment from sampling sites in Terengganu mangrove forest estuary, lagoon and river are shown in Table 3. Generally, sediments from all sampling sites were mainly composed of sand. However, sites can be differentiated by the composition of different particle sizes, sediment texture, and percentage of organic matter content. Sediments collected from Setiu Wetlands, Kuala Ibai mangrove estuary, and Kerteh mangrove river were dominated by fine sand; meanwhile, sediments from Merchang mangrove estuary and Kuala Ibai lagoon were dominated by a mixture of fine pebble + granule and medium size sand, respectively.

https://binary.pensoft.net/fig/1062333

Etymology.

The new name denotes the type locality (Kerteh River) where the specimens were collected.

Type locality.

South China Sea, Malaysia, east coast of Peninsular, Terengganu, Kerteh River (see Fig. 1).

Distribution.

Known only from the type locality.

Habitat.

Gravelly muddy sand (Table 4), burrowing inside driftwood, in mangroves, intertidal (Fig. 7A–C) with salinity 3.18‰ during spring low tide.

Remarks.

With the presence of only limbate chaetae in both supra- and subacicular chaetae bundles, Marphysakertehensis sp. nov. belongs to Marphysa Group A (Mossambica). Comparing Marphysa Group A from Malaysia’s coastal water bodies, M.kertehensis sp. nov. is similar to M.moribidii (type locality: Morib, Malaysia) in lacking eyes. Table 5 lists the characteristics of Group A species, such as the presence or absence of peduncle in the prostomial appendages, the number of types of pectinate chaetae, chaetiger from where the branchiae commence and finish, number of branchial filaments and subacicular hooks and all differ from the new species. Marphysakertehensis sp. nov. has three types of pectinate chaetae (types 1, 2, 4) but lacks any wide anodont chaetae (types 6, 7, 8), while M.moribidii has four types, including wide anodont (types 1, 4, 5, 8). Although they all have the same type of pectinate branchiae and the chaetiger where the branchiae emerge, M.moribidii (TL: 333 mm) has a wider range variation of chaetiger where the branchiae emerge; they occur from chaetiger 35 (4–63) whereas in M.kertehensis sp. nov. (TL: 413 (173–295) mm), the branchiae are present from chaetiger 41 (27–58). There are no subacicular hooks present in all specimens of M.kertehensis sp. nov., but there are a few subacicular hooks present in the paratype of M.moribidiiAM W.38690. Additionally, M.kertehensis sp. nov. has a black dot at the base of dorsal cirri in median and posterior chaetigers, possibly a reservoir of blood to irrigate the branchiae, which is absent in M.moribidii. It is worth mentioning that comparisons between the two species were based only on morphological features as there is no sequence data published for M.moribidii. Furthermore, each species lives in a different habitat. Marphysakertehensis sp. nov. was found in the driftwood within the mangrove area dominated by Exoecariaagallocha, meanwhile M.moribidii inhabits mangrove forest with Rhizophora spp., Avicenniaalba and Sonneratiacaseolaris (Idris et al. 2014).

Remarks.

With the presence of only compound spinigers along the whole body and branchiae along most of the body, Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. belongs to the Marphysa Group B (Sanguinea). Other Marphysa species from Sanguinea-group occurring in the same water body (South China Sea) as M.merchangensis sp. nov. are M.setiuense sp. nov., M.hongkongensa Wang, Zhang & Qiu, 2018 (type locality: Hong Kong), M.iloiloensis Glasby, Mandario, Burghardt, Kupriyanova, Gunton & Hutchings, 2019 (type locality: Philippines), M.multipectinata Liu, Hutchings & Sun, 2017 (type locality: Shimen, Taiwan of China), M.orientalis Treadwell, 1936 (type locality: Xiamen, China), M.tribranchiata Liu, Hutchings & Sun, 2017 (type locality: Wanli, Taiwan of China), and M.tripectinata Liu, Hutchings & Sun, 2017 (type locality: Beihai, China).

Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. is similar to M.setiuense sp. nov. in having a pair of eyes and the absence of peduncle on the prostomial appendages. However, they can be differentiated by the number of types of pectinate chaetae, maxillary formula, chaetiger on which the branchiae and subacicular hooks occur, shape of dorsal cirri, chaetal lobes and subacicular hooks. Number of types of pectinate chaetae in M.merchangensis sp. nov. is five (types 1, 4, 5, 6, 8), whereas in M.setiuense sp. nov. there are four (types 1, 2, 7, 8), and they lack the thick, wide isodont pectinate chaetae (types 4, 5). Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. (L10: 5.25 (3.45–5.85) mm) has more denticles on MIII 7 (6–7)+0 compared to M.setiuense sp. nov. (L10: 2.7 (2.85–4.8) mm) which has MIII: 5 (4–6)+0. Branchiae and subacicular hook of M.merchangensis sp. nov. occur later (chaetiger 24 (16–27) and 37 (26–42)), respectively) compared to M.setiuense sp. nov., where they occur from chaetiger 20 (15–25) and 25 (21–38), respectively. Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. has digitiform dorsal cirri along the whole body, while M.setiuense sp. nov. has both thumb-shaped and digitiform dorsal cirri. Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. has rounded shaped chaetal lobe in the anterior and posterior, and conical in the median region, whereas M.setiuense sp. nov. has rounded chaetal lobes on all parapodia. Finally, M.merchangensis sp. nov. has unidentate subacicular hook, whereas M.setiuense sp. nov. has unidentate and a few bidentate subacicular hooks present in posterior chaetigers.

Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. and M.hongkongensa can be differentiated by the presence or absence of eyes, number of types of pectinate chaetae, maximum number of branchial filaments, and the shape of subacicular hooks. Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. has a pair of eyes but they are absent in M.hongkongensa. Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. has five types of pectinate chaetae (types 1, 4, 5, 6, 8) compared to four types present in M.hongkongensa (types 1, 2, 7, 8). Marphysahongkongensa lacks thick, wide isodont and thick, narrow anodont pectinate chaetae (types 4, 5, 6) which are present in the new species. The maximum number of branchial filaments in M.merchangensis sp. nov. (L10: 5.25 (3.45–5.85) mm) is six and they begin from chaetiger 24 (16–27) whereas M.hongkongensa (L10: 3.3–7 mm) has a maximum of ten branchial filaments, beginning from chaetiger 15–35. Finally, M.merchangensis sp. nov. only has unidentate subacicular hooks while both unidentate and bidentate subacicular hooks are present in M.hongkongensa.

Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. is similar to M.iloiloensis and M.multipectinata in having a pair of eyes. However, they can be distinguished by the number of types of pectinate chaetae present, the chaetiger on which branchiae and subacicular hooks occur, number of branchial filaments, shape of subacicular hooks and the maxillae formula. Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. has five types of pectinate chaetae (types 1, 4, 5, 6, 8) whereas M.iloiloensis and M.multipectinata have three (types 1, 4, 6) and four (types 1, 4, 7, 8) respectively. Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. and M.iloiloensis have the same type of pectinate branchiae (beginning on the same chaetiger with different range of variation) (chaetiger 24 (16–27) for the new species, and chaetiger 19 (16–20) for M.iloiloensis). The maximum number of branchial filaments in M.merchangensis sp. nov. (TL: 94 (37–144) mm) is six, while M.iloiloensis (TL: 99 (95–165+) mm) has a maximum of seven branchial filaments. Marphysamultipectinata (L10: 13.9 mm) has palmate branchiae with maximum of five branchial filaments from chaetiger 32. Finally, all these species have different formulae for MII, MIII and MIV (see Table 6).

The other species from the Sanguinea complex, M.tribranchiata and M.tripectinata differ from M.merchangensis sp. nov. by the absence of eyes. Both M.tribranchiata and M.tripectinata have three types of pectinate chaetae, whereas M.merchangensis sp. nov. has five types. Marphysatribranchiata lacks thick, wide isodont and thick, narrow anodont pectinate chaetae (types 4, 6), while M.tripectinata lacks thin, narrow isodont pectinate chaetae (type 1) which are present in the new species (types 1, 4, 5, 6, 8). While M.merchangensis sp. nov. and M.tripectinata only have unidentate subacicular hooks, they begin much later (chaetiger 170) in the latter species. Marphysatribranchiata has both unidentate and bidentate subacicular hooks whereas only unidentate hooks are present in M.merchangensis sp. nov. The maximum number of branchiae filaments present in M.tribranchiata (L10: 8.7 mm) and M tripectinata (L10: 12.7 mm) are three and eight respectively, differs from M.merchangensis sp. nov. (L10: 5.25 (3.45–5.85) mm), which has a maximum of six.

Finally, M.merchangensis sp. nov. is similar to M.orientalis by having unidentate subacicular hooks. Marphysamerchangensis sp. nov. has a pair of eyes and two pairs of anal cirri, while M.orientalis has no eyes and only one pair of anal cirri. Also, branchiae in M.merchangensis sp. nov. begin earlier from chaetiger 24 (16–27) compared to M.orientalis (chaetiger 45). The maximum number of branchial filaments in M.merchangensis sp. nov. is six, while M.orientalis has a maximum of three branchial filaments. Nevertheless, the original description of M.orientalis is incomplete and does not include certain important features such as the number and type of pectinate chaetae. Fresh material of M.orientalis should be collected and redescribed from the type locality at Gulf of Mannar, Sri Lanka.

Etymology.

The name refers to the type locality Setiu Wetlands.

Type locality.

South China Sea, Malaysia, east coast of Peninsular, Terengganu, Setiu Wetlands (see Fig. 1).

Distribution.

Known only from the type locality.

Habitat.

Slightly gravelly sand sediment (Table 4), burrowing in decayed roots of mangrove trees (Sonneratia spp.) and area within Taliparititiliaceum (Fig. 13A–C), with salinity 26‰ during spring low tide.

Remarks.

With the presence of only compound spiniger along the whole body and branchiae along most of the body, Marphysasetiuense sp. nov. belongs to Group B (Sanguinea). As mentioned earlier, there are seven other Sanguinea-group Marphysa species described from the South China Sea; M.merchangensis sp. nov., M.hongkongensa, M.iloiloensis, M.multipectinata, M.orientalis, M.tribranchiata and M.tripectinata. The most morphologically-similar species to M.setiuense sp. nov. is M.hongkongensa. Both species have four types of pectinate chaetae (two isodont and two anodont; types 1, 2, 7, 8) and have both unidentate and bidentate subacicular hooks in posterior chaetigers. However, they differ in the number of branchial filaments and the distribution of branchiae. Marphysasetiuense sp. nov. (L10: 2.7 (2.85–4.8) mm) has a maximum of five branchial filaments while M.hongkongensa (L10: 3.3–7 mm) has up to ten. Also, the species have different maxillae formulae. Marphysasetiuense sp. nov. has fewer denticles on MIII (5 (4–6)+0) compared to M.hongkongensa which has MIII (7+0) (see Table 6).

Marphysasetiuense sp. nov. is similar to M.iloiloensis and M.multipectinata in having a pair of eyes, but they can be distinguished by the number of types of pectinate chaetae, the chaetiger on which branchiae and subacicular hooks begin, number of branchial filaments, shape of subacicular hooks and maxillae formula. Marphysasetiuense sp. nov. has four types of pectinate chaetae (types 1, 2, 7, 8) compared to three types present in M.iloiloensis (types 1, 4, 6). Marphysamultipectinata also has four types of pectinate chaetae (types 1, 4, 7, 8), but they are only present on median and posterior chaetigers, whereas in M.setiuense sp. nov., the pectinate chaetae are present throughout the body. The maximum number of branchial filament in M.setiuense sp. nov. (L10: 2.7 (2.85–4.8) mm) is five, and up to seven for M.iloiloensis. Marphysamultipectinata (L10: 13.9 mm) has palmate branchiae with maximum five branchial filaments and begin from chaetiger 32 whereas Marphysasetiuense sp. nov. also has a maximum of five branchial filaments but they begin from chaetiger 20 (15–25). Marphysasetiuense sp. nov. and M.multipectinata have unidentate and bidentate subacicular hooks from chaetiger 25 (21–38) and chaetiger 20, whereas M.iloiloensis has unidentate subacicular hooks only from chaetiger 30–38. All these species have different formulae for MII, MIII, and MIV (see Table 6).

The other two Marphysa species of the Sanguinea complex occurring within the South China Sea, M.tribranchiata and M.tripectinata differ from M.setiuense sp. nov. by having no eyes. They also can be differentiated by the number of types of pectinate chaetae. Marphysatribranchiata and M.tripectinata have three types of pectinate chaetae, while M.setiuense sp. nov. has four (types 1, 2, 7, 8). Marphysatribranchiata lacks thin, wide isodont (type 2), while M.tripectinata lacks thin, narrow isodont pectinate chaetae (type 1). Also, M.tripectinata (L10: 12.7 mm) only has unidentate subacicular hooks, whereas M.tribranchiata (L10: 8.7 mm) and M.setiuense sp. nov. (L10: 2.7 (2.85–4.8) mm) have both unidentate and bidentate subacicular hooks.

Marphysasetiuense sp. nov. and M.orientalis differ by the presence or absence of eyes, shape of subacicular hooks, pair of anal cirri, the chaetiger on which the branchiae begin and the maximum number of branchial filaments. Marphysasetiuense sp. nov. has a pair of eyes and two pairs of anal cirri, while M.orientalis has no eyes and only one pair of anal cirri. The new species has unidentate and bidentate subacicular hooks while M.orientalis has only unidentate subacicular hooks. Branchiae in M.setiuense sp. nov. begin from chaetiger 20 (15–25) whereas in M.orientalis they occur from chaetiger 45. The maximum number of branchial filaments in M.setiuense sp. nov. is five, while M.orientalis only has three branchial filaments.

Etymology.

Name refers to the type locality Kuala Ibai River.

Type locality.

South China Sea, Malaysia, east coast of Peninsular, Terengganu, Kuala Ibai river estuary and lagoon (see Fig. 1).

Distribution.

Known only from the type locality.

Habitat.

Remarks.

With the presence of subacicular limbate and compound spinigers in the median and posterior region, M.ibaiensis sp. nov. belongs to Group E (Gravelyi). There are four Marphysa species belonging to this group; M.borradailei Pillai, 1958 (type locality: Negombo Lagoon, Sri Lanka), M.fauchaldi Glasby & Hutchings, 2010 (type locality: Ardatek Barrumundi farm, Darwin, Australia), M.gravelyi Southern, 1921 (type locality: Chilka Lake, India) and M.madrasi Hutchings, Lavesque, Priscilla, Daffe, Malathi & Glasby, 2020 (type locality: Chennai, India). The morphological features of these species are given in Table 7.

Marphysaibaiensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from M.borradailei by the number of branchial filaments, shape of the subacicular hooks, chaetiger where the branchiae and subacicular hook occur, and the shape of postchaetal lobe in the anterior region. Marphysaibaiensis sp. nov. (TL: 52 (20–91) mm) has a maximum of eight branchial filaments whereas M.borradailei (TL: 1–8 mm) has up to 20 branchial filaments. The subacicular hook of M.ibaiensis sp. nov. is bidentate and occurs from chaetiger 22 (22–46) onwards while M.borradailei has a strongly hooded unidentate hook that occur from chaetiger 50 onwards. Marphysaibaiensis sp. nov. has rounded postchaetal lobe in anterior region, while M.borradailei has sub-conical shaped postchaetal lobes in the anterior region. The original description of M.borradailei makes it challenging to undertake a detailed morphological comparison and additional material from the type locality (Sri Lanka) needs to be collected and redescribed.

The new species can also be differentiated from M.gravelyi and M.madrasi by the absence of eyes, number of types of pectinate chaetae, number of branchial filaments, chaetiger where subacicular hooks begin and the length of the pygidial cirri. Marphysaibaiensis sp. nov. has no eyes, while both M.gravelyi and M.madrasi have a pair of eyes. Marphysaibaiensis sp. nov. has five types of pectinate chaetae (types 1, 3, 4, 5, 7), whereas M.madrasi has only two (types 4, 5). While all these species have bidentate hooks, they begin on chaetiger 22 (22–46) in M.ibaiensis sp. nov. (L10: 4.5 (2.25–6.3) mm), 26–35 in M.gravelyi and 33–72 in M.madrasi (L10: 6 (4–9) mm). Marphysaibaiensis sp. nov. has short and long pairs of pygidial cirri attached to the pygidium, whereas M.madrasi only has one pair of short pygidial cirri.

Marphysaibaiensis sp. nov. differs from M.fauchaldi by the absence of peduncle in prostomial appendages, the chaetiger on which the branchiae and subacicular hook occur and the distribution of subacicular limbate chaetae. Subacicular hooks and branchiae of M.ibaiensis sp. nov. (TL: 52 (20–91) mm) have a wide range variation of chaetiger where they begin; from chaetiger 22 (22–46) and 20 (11–65), respectively compared to M.fauchaldi (TL: 190 (78–155) mm); they begin from chaetiger 40 (31–50) and 31 (22–32), respectively. The subacicular limbate chaetae in M.ibaiensis sp. nov. occur from mid-chaetigers onwards whereas in M.fauchaldi, they are restricted to posterior chaetigers.

﻿Discussion

Prior to this study, a total of ten Marphysa species were described from Malaysia and nearby coastal waters (South China Sea and Andaman Sea) including one species from Group A (Mossambica) – Marphysamoribidii, six species from Group B (Sanguinea) – M.iloiloensis, M.hongkongensa, M.multipectinata, M.orientalis, M.tribranchiata, and M.tripectinata, one species from Group D (Belli) – M.digitibranchia Hoagland, 1920 (type locality: Hong Kong), and two species from Group E (Gravelyi) – M.madrasi and M.gravelyi. This study increases the number of Marphysa species from these water regions to 14.

Characteristics such as the distribution of different types of chaetae, including pectinate chaetae, branchial distribution and number of filaments, and jaw formula, allowed us to describe four new species. These characters have also been used recently by Lavesque et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2020) in their studies of species of Marphysa.

All these new species occur in slightly different types of habitats, but share several general characteristics: all are found in mangrove areas, tolerate a wide range of salinity (euryhaline), and live in high percentage of sand. According to Glasby and Hutchings (2010), habitat type is a useful character to recognise species in a particular area. Therefore, describing a species’ habitat is important for taxonomic studies and conservation strategy management.

Phylogenetic analysis from COI data placed M.merchangensis sp. nov. as sister to M.hongkongensa, M.setiuense sp. nov. as sister to M.iloiloensis, M.ibaiensis sp. nov. as sister to M.madrasi, and M.kertehensis sp. nov. as sister to M.mossambica (Peters, 1854). Nevertheless, the interspecific divergence between these new species and all their sister taxa pair is high (Pair-wise Kimura 2-parameter – COIK2P range 6.14%–19.16% (see Suppl. material 1), which clearly showed the distinct genetic separation. Additionally, obtaining sequence data for M.moribidii is imperative to investigate the genetic difference between M.moribidii and M.kertehensis sp. nov. as they possessed a few similar morphological features and occur within Malaysian water bodies. The molecular analysis in this study aligns with the morphological analysis and confirms the presence of four new Marphysa species in the Terengganu mangrove area.

﻿Conclusions

Four species of Marphysa from Terengganu mangrove forests (lagoon, river, and estuary) were described and confirmed by morphology and molecular data and can also be separated based on their habitat. This study increases the species in the genus Marphysa and the number of polychaetes described from Malaysia. In addition, data provided in this study can also provide insight for future research on the potential use of Marphysa species in Malaysia as the only described species in Malaysia, M.moribidii has revealed a wide potential application for commercial use.
