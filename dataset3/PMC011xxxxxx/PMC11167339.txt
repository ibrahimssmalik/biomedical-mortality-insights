Background

The greater pipefish Syngnathus acus is widely distributed in the north-eastern Atlantic around coastlines, to depths of 100 m. Its habitat includes macroalgae beds, intertidal rocky shores as well as sand and mud at estuarine edges ( Russel, 2002). However, it is most commonly associated with sea grass ( Zostera spp.) beds ( Vincent et al., 1995).

Syngnathus acus is a demersal syngnathid, a group characterized by its tubular snout ending in a tiny mouth, and their male parental care strategies. In fish of the Syngnathus genus, eggs and developing embryos are enclosed within specialised brooding structures (a marsupium) located on the ventral side of male fish ( Planas, 2022). Pipefish lacking a marsupium seem to produce smaller and less developed plankton larvae, whereas those with a marsupium, like S. acus, give birth to fully formed juveniles which immediately resume a benthic position upon release ( Silva et al., 2006).

Like most of the ray-finned fish, (Actinopterygii) fish in the Syngnathidae family feed using suction, using their specialised lengthened and fused snout to catch faster and more mobile prey ( de Lussanet & Muller, 2007).

Although ecological research on this species is lacking, the available data suggest high seasonal and spatial variability in distribution and abundances, which may be governed by temperature, habitat and prey availability and potential migratory events ( Planas, 2022).

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one Syngnathus acus ( Figure 1) collected from Cawsand Bay, Plymouth, UK (50.34, –4.15). A total of 80-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected five missing joins or mis-joins and removed one haplotypic duplication, reducing the scaffold count by one, and decreasing the scaffold N50 by 1.84%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Syngnathus acus (fSynAcu2) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 359.2 Mb in 251 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 15.3 Mb ( Table 1). Most (92.29%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 22 chromosomal-level scaffolds. Chromosome-scale scaffolds are named by synteny based on the S. acus assembly GCF_901709675.1 ( Figure 2– Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

A Syngnathus acus (specimen number MBA-211018-001A, individual fSynAcu2) was collected from Cawsand Bay, Plymouth, UK, from the MBA SEPIA vessel (latitude 50.34, longitude –4.15) on 2021-10-18. The specimen was captured using a Naturalist dredge and placed in a suitable container. The specimen was identified by Kesella Scott-Somme (Marine Biological Association) based on gross morphology. The fish was first anaesthetised and then overdosed using Aquased (2-phenoxyethanol). Destruction of the brain was used as a secondary method to ensure the animal was deceased before tissue sampling took place as in accordance with Schedule 1 methodology under the home office licence. The samples taken from the fish were preserved in liquid nitrogen.

DNA was extracted at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The fSynAcu2 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice with tissue set aside for Hi-C sequencing. Somatic tissue was cryogenically disrupted to a fine powder using a Covaris cryoPREP Automated Dry Pulveriser, receiving multiple impacts. High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted using the Qiagen MagAttract HMW DNA extraction kit. HMW DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30. Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation using AMPure PB beads with a 1.8X ratio of beads to sample to remove the shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA sample. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on the Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from tissue of fSynAcu2 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2022), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

Version 1recommendationapprove
The complete nuclear and mitochondrial genome of the greater pipefish was sequenced. The pipefish are closely related to sea horses and have evolved a highly modified body plan.

The genome size is 359Mb. It was not possible to fully phase the assembly. The contig N50 is 4.9Mb, which indicate that the genome is of high contiguity. The complete BUSCO genes are at 94.9%

Minor comments:

Background: the second sentence “Its habitat includes macroalgae beds, intertidal rocky shores as well as sand and mud at estuarine edges” sounds weird. It sounds like the pipefish live in mud, which I do not think is correct.

The mitochondrial genome has not been deposited or separated from the assembly. That makes it difficult for someone that is only interested in the MT genome. It would recommend making it available on its own. Or maybe it is already done, but this is not fully clear from the sentence “The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission”.

conclusions: The assembly and the assembly report reads well and the high contiguity genome is a valuable addition to understanding the evolution of the highly morphologically  modified seahorses/pipefishes.
