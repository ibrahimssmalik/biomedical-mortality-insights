Reduced Reinforced Concrete Material Waste (RRCMW) in building projects is regarded as a critical issue that must be managed. The main purpose of the research is to illustrate the importance of BIM in construction. Also, it is found that the main objectives of this paper are to study the improvement of practicing BIM in Egypt and, practicing of BIM in construction industry in Egypt is also measured. Two questionnaires survey are conducted. The first questionnaire is to measure the improvement of using BIM during the last 7 years and it is discovered that there is a massive improvement in using BIM in this period. The second questionnaire is to determine the adopting value of BIM in Egyptian projects in order to meet the study objective. So, based on the questionnaire analysis, it is discovered that about 94% of consultants actually practicing BIM in 3D while about 72% of contractors agree with practicing BIM in 3D. Also it is found that about 86% and 78% of consultants actually practicing BIM in 4D and 5D while only about 43% and 40% of contractors agree with practicing BIM 4D and 5D model respectively. Only about 61% and 58% considered that BIM is important in 6D and 7D respectively because it isn’t widely used in Egypt and engineers use BIM up to 5D. As a result, the findings reveal that the number of consultant’s site engineer’s respondents are more than contractors because the usage of BIM is effective in the field of design and consultancy more than using in site and while BIM isn't extensively utilized in Egypt, engineers should be familiar with it because it will be a useful tool in the future. So, the main purpose of this study is to illustrate practicing of BIM in the Egyptian construction projects and study the improvement of using BIM during the last 7 years in Egypt because BIM is considered as an important technology used to reduce waste in construction projects from design stage to construction and operation stage but still not used in Egypt in a wide range till now, so it is very crucial to study this issue. Also, another main objective of this study is to compare the development done in using BIM during the last 8 years to make sure that using BIM in Egypt is going on and developed.

pmcIntroduction

Waste in construction sites is because of a lack of the attention being paid to the size of product used, lack of the interest of contractors and lack of knowledge about construction during activities1. To diagnose the nature of the Egyptian Construction Industry, a previous study performed by Garas et al.2 is considered. This study aims to identify the main causes affecting materials waste in Construction Egyptian Industry. It is found that main causes of material waste are late information, uncompleted design, inadequate information, poor control, unnecessary people move, untrained labor, work not done, poor technology of equipment, changes in design and damage during transportation. So, it is very critical to study this issue in Egypt. According to Shaqour and Almashhour3 the most common causes of waste in Egypt are selecting contractors with low experience, material damage in construction sites, poor planning and scheduling of the work by contractors, selection of low quality material, poor storages, and poor control on work contractors. Also, construction and demolition waste is a critical issue in Egypt. The problem is serious in Egypt, in which CDW represent up to 40% of total materials cost in construction projects and the main factors behind CDWG in Egypt can be summarized as follows: (1) deficiencies in waste-efficient practices; (2) lack of awareness; (3) absence of appropriate culture and behaviour; (4) lack of strict legislation; (5) lack of coordination among project parties; (6) scar city of legal dumpsites; and (7) lack of adoption to CDW recycle and reuse4. Also, a study conducted by Reda et al.5 to investigate the applicability and effectiveness of Safe Disposal of Construction Demolition Waste (SDCDW) factors in the Egyptian construction industry and examining the relationship between these factors and SDCDW found that (1) among the various factors, ‘‘selection of the shortest path transport route” has the highest applicability, while ‘‘detection of CDW illegal disposal sites” is the most effective factor; and (2) there exist positive statistical relationships between SDCDW and all of the various factors.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a new revolution in our daily construction industry which represents the most important method to calculate all the components of any construction project accurately. The large amount of waste and in efficiency is because on-site rework as every change order that cost the owner or the builder money and don’t add value to the building is considered as waste. To avoid or reduce the construction waste, procedures that is based on careful planning, monitoring and controlling system should be applied6. So using building information modeling (BIM) is the most appropriate technique to use. BIM plays an important role in reducing waste during the design and pre-construction phase and involves representing a design as objects that carry their geometry, relations, and attributes7. Although not called BIM, the original concepts of BIM have been developed since 19708. It was also found that about 70% to 80% of drawing are currently produced digitally in Scandinavian construction sector9. At the past the traditional methods were used for drawing sections, elevations, and plans by using ruler and papers then using the 2D program as AutoCAD (2D) appeared. The main difference between 2D CAD and BIM is that 2D CAD describes building as plans, sections, and elevations and editing one of these views requires checking and update all the other views. Another main difference is that using the traditional method 2D CAD represents the building as lines, arcs, and circles while objects are defined in BIM as spaces, walls, beams, and columns. BIM includes all information, quantities, and properties of building elements, cost estimates, materials inventories and project schedule and demonstrates the entire building life cycle, so results can be extracted from BIM model easily and accurately10. Figure 1 demonstrates BIM dimensions.Figure 1 BIM dimensions (evolutions).

To protect existing natural resources, building waste must be managed properly, which necessitates comprehensive training on the identification and separation of recyclable materials at construction sites11. One of the key reasons of waste creation has been identified as a lack of on-site waste management strategy12. Without a forecast of construction waste quantities related to the project execution plan, proper execution and planning are impossible13. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a new construction industry revolution that represents the most significant way for correctly estimating all the components of any building project. On-site rework is responsible for the enormous amount of waste and inefficiency. Every change order that costs the owner or builder money but adds no value to the project is considered waste. Procedures based on monitoring, controlling systems, and careful planning should be used to minimize or decrease construction waste6. As a result, the most appropriate strategy is to apply building information modelling (BIM). BIM is a technique for reducing waste in building projects throughout the design and pre-construction phases. It includes representing a design as objects with relationships, geometry, and properties7. BIM contain all information, quantities, and properties of building elements, as well as material inventories, cost estimates, and project schedules, and represents the whole building life cycle, allowing for easy and accurate extraction of results from the BIM model10. Building Information Modeling (BIM) consider as the most important new technique in the construction industry. A study illustrates by Autodesk14 demonstrates that 42% of non-users of BIM believe that BIM will be highly or very highly important in 5 years, and also found that the growth of BIM in use raised from 28% in 2007 to 48% in 2009. Another study is conducted by McGraw Hill Construction15 find that the adoption of BIM in US expands from 49% in 2009 to over 71% in 2012 and about 15,000 h across the whole design has been saved according to WRAP UK Construction16. BIM also provides accurate visualization for all project's members to have a complete understanding of materials and machinery layout, activity procedure and conflicts between building elements6. BIM can be classified into Design BIM and Construction BIM. Design BIM demonstrates the coordination within the design team (the architect, structural, and mechanical engineer) and Construction BIM related to the actual fabrication and construction of materials to 100% accurate dimensioning. Design and construction BIM have valuable uses and are improving the overall quality and economy of construction, so integrated BIM can be defined as the process that removes waste and created additional value by reducing construction schedule, costs and risks17. So, the main purpose of this study is to demonstrate practicing of BIM in the Egyptian construction projects and study the improvement of using BIM during the last 7 years in Egypt.

Practicing of BIM in construction projects

There are several benefits of BIM, the main benefit is how to create the model virtually and check its constructability in real world before it is done actually. This allows for more efficiency and better designed structures that limit waste of resources. It also allows for improved planning and scheduling, helps to reduce cost and allows for a better collaboration on the job site6. One of the most important benefits of BIM are: making early analysis of design at the design phase and allowing to quickly transport very accurate information14. BIM aims to develop deep learning about fundamental of structural analysis and design, improve digital modeling, and achieve quality to meet today's demands18. BIM also could enhance communication, increase efficiency and reduce errors which helps to reduce resources, energy, materials and waste and provides the opportunity of testing, revising, rejecting and accepting design ideas in real-time19. The following Table 1 illustrates practicing BIM in construction projects. Table 1 Practicing BIM in construction projects.

Research methodology

Applying social research interviews and questionnaire survey is the most used technique of data collection. The research methodology consists of collected data using a structured questionnaires. The first questionnaire purpose is to study the improvement of BIM in Egypt and, the second questionnaire main objective is to study practicing BIM in Egypt in the last 8 years compared with another Egyptian study. Figure 2 demonstrates the research methodology in detail.Figure 2 Methodology chart.

Questionnaire design

Questionnaires consists of the participant’s personal information as position and experience. For the first questionnaire, improvement of practicing Building Information Modeling in Egypt during the last 7 years is measured, using option out of the 1–5 scale, 1 = “Strongly Agree”; 2 = “Agree”; 3 = “Neutral”; 4 = “Disagree” and 5 = “Strongly Disagree”. For the second questionnaire, some general questions about the importance of BIM are distributed to respondents to analyze the practicing of BIM in construction industry, using option out of the 1–5 scale, 1 = “Highly unimportant”; 2 = “Unimportant”; 3 = “Neutral”; 4 = “Important” and 5 = “Highly important”. Data was put in excel sheets after filling the questionnaire and applied Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) for further analysis. The main usage of SPSS is checking the consistency of data. Mean score and SD are measured. To provide a degree of importance, an importance index is calculated as shown in Eq. (1). Where Pi = Practicing index; ai = weight of the ith response; xi = frequency of the ith response; and i = response category index.

In this study, reliability test is conducted to check the data uniformity through (Cronbach Alpha) to check the consistency of data. Generally, the reliability coefficient of 0.7 and above is good and acceptable30. So, data for this study is acceptable and reliable. The Cronbach’s Alpha for this study based on SPSS analysis is 81% which considered suitable and acceptable.1 Pi=∑i=1nai∗xi5

According to a study conducted by Baxter and Bartlett31, the following formula is used to compute the required sample size for this study.2 P=K2∗P(1-P)E2

where N is the sample size needed, K value equals 1.645 with confidence level of 90%, P degree of variance is 0.5 with E the acceptable margin of error = 10%. By substituting all of these parameters in previous equation, the required sample size of this study is 68 as a minimum value.

Analysis and discussion

Questionnaire respondents

Two questionnaires survey are conducted and distributed to contractor and consultant site engineers from different types of construction projects such as residential and bridges projects. The questionnaires are distributed to 200 respondents in the top, medium and lower-level management working in construction site who deals regularly with reinforced concrete works and who applies BIM practically. Only 180 responds are participating and answering the two questionnaires. So, the total number of participants taken into consideration in this study are 180 and they are distributed as 81 contractor engineers and 99 consultants’ engineers.

BIM is a very effective tool in minimizing project cost, eliminating design errors and reducing rework. Based on the questionnaire analysis, the respondents are asked about their perspective of applying BIM compared with traditional method. The respondents are categorized into contractor site engineers and consultant site engineers. The number of consultant’s engineer’s respondents are more than contractors because the usage of BIM is effective in the field of design and consultancy more than using in site. Figure 3 illustrates the number of respondents based on their experience (E).Figure 3 Participants respondents according to experience.

Analysis and discussion of improvement of practicing building information modeling in Egypt

El-Yamany32 find that using BIM is limited and not effective in Egypt till now. The research concluded that BIM is expanding in the Egyptian construction industry in the near future and practitioners think it is the future of construction industry while moving to sustainable buildings. The research also concluded that the construction industry don’t have enough knowledge to apply BIM, which enhance the need to provide more knowledge and information to all project participants regarding the benefits of BIM technology. So it is too important to make a questionnaire to measure the improvement of practicing BIM in Egypt. This questionnaire is a new copy from El-Yamany32 questionnaire. The purpose of this questionnaire is to compare between the results of respondents about the importance of using BIM in Egypt during the last 7 years. The results of the questionnaire are as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2.Figure 4 Study the improvement of practicing BIM.

Table 2 Study the improvement of practicing BIM.

From the previous table, it is found that a huge improvement in using BIM in the last 7 years happen. This will reflect the construction industry positively because the improvement in practicing BIM leads to material waste minimization which is considered as the main purpose of this study. The respondents demonstrate that about 53% strongly agree about the government on the right track with BIM while only about 14% strongly agree with this issue in 2016. About 61% of respondents strongly agree that engineers hear more about BIM while it is only about 51% in32 strongly agree with this issue. Also about 22% of respondents are strongly agree that the government use BIM in public sector work while only about 7% of respondents strongly agree in 2016. So, it is demonstrated that there is a massive improvement in using BIM in the last 7 years.

Analysis and discussion of practicing of building information modeling in construction industry

For the first questionnaire, Improvement of practicing Building Information Modeling in Egypt is measured. Some questions of El-Yamany32 are studied and analyzed to make a comparison between the usages of BIM from 2016 to 2023. For the second questionnaire, practicing of BIM in construction modeling is measured. Some general questions are asked about the importance of using BIM in construction projects in Egypt. The respondents answers based on scale from 1–5 to clarify their opinions.

Table 3 illustrates the importance and Practicing Index (Pi) of using BIM. Table 3 Importance and Practicing Index (Pi) of using BIM.

From the previous table it is found that about 94% of consultants actually practicing BIM in 3D while about 72% of contractors agree with practicing BIM in 3D. Also it is found that about 86% and 78% of consultants actually practicing BIM in 4D and 5D while only about 43% and 40% of contractors agree with practicing BIM 4D and 5D model respectively. This prove that using BIM in Egypt is up to 5D and consultants use BIM more than contractors. It is also found that about 61% and 58% of total respondents considered that BIM is important in 6D and 7D respectively because it isn’t widely used in Egypt. It is found that 90% of consultant and 84% of contractors considered that BIM improve quantity take-off and estimating. About 96% of consultants and 91% of contractors considered BIM importance in coordination. It is also demonstrated that about 87% of respondents are considered the using BIM in design stage. It is also demonstrated that about 83%, 92% and 93% of respondents considered using BIM in residential, non-residential and infrastructure projects respectively. Also it is found that about 96%, 93% and 91% of consultants agree with the importance of BIM in 3D, 4D and 5D while only about 97%, 93% and 89% of contractors agree with the importance of BIM in 3D, 4D and 5D model respectively. So, the reason for the disagreement between the consultant and the contractor regarding the results is that the contractor does not use BIM and its applications to the same extent that the consultant uses it, and the contractor does not rely on using BIM permanently during implementation on site. It is also found that about 94% of total respondents agreed that Engineers hear more about BIM currently and Engineers think BIM is the future of project information. About 83% of total respondents think the Government is on the right track with BIM and about 58% of total respondents think the government use BIM for public sector work. Finally, about 92% of total respondents agreed that BIM facilitates modified design or construction methods. So, using BIM is very important and should be developed in Egypt to include all project lifecycle and all stakeholders.

Conclusion

The findings reveal that, based on the first questionnaire, there is a massive improvement in using BIM in the last 7 years in Egypt but using BIM is still limited and not effective in Egypt till now. So it is very necessary for engineers to have knowledge about BIM implementation in order to be qualified to work with BIM. For the second questionnaire, it is found that the number of consultant’s site engineer’s respondents are more than contractors because the usage of BIM is effective in the field of design and consultancy more than using in site. It has been shown that while 72% of contractors agree with using BIM in 3D, 94% of consultants actively do so. Additionally, it was shown that while only roughly 43% and 40% of contractors agreed to the use of the BIM 4D and 5D models, respectively, 86% and 78% of consultants actually use BIM in these two dimensions. This demonstrates that consultants utilize BIM more than contractors do, and that BIM usage in Egypt is on par with 5D. Additionally, it was discovered that due to BIM's limited adoption in Egypt, 61% and 58% of respondents thought that it was crucial in 6D and 7D, respectively. 90% of consultants and 84% of contractors said that BIM improved quantity take-off and estimating, according to the study. Around 96% of 91% of contractors and consultants said BIM was important for coordination. Additionally, it is shown that roughly 87% of respondents thought that BIM is being used throughout the design stage. Furthermore, it is shown that around 83 percent, 92 percent, and 93 percent of respondents thought about adopting BIM in residential, non-residential, and infrastructure projects. Also using BIM is very effective but not used in a wide range. So, it is found that there is a massive improvement in using BIM in the last 7 years. Also, the importance of BIM among consultants is high, and they use it in projects to a greater extent than contractors.

Recommendations

Monitoring the results of the current study, trying to develop it on a larger scale in construction projects in general, and trying to develop the use of BIM more effectively to reduce the percentage of waste.
