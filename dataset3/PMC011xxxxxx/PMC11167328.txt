We present the genome assembly of the pennate diatom Epithemia pelagica strain UHM3201 (Ochrophyta; Bacillariophyceae; Rhopalodiales; Rhopalodiaceae) and that of its cyanobacterial endosymbiont (Chroococcales: Aphanothecaceae). The genome sequence of the diatom is 60.3 megabases in span, and the cyanobacterial genome has a length of 2.48 megabases. Most of the diatom nuclear genome assembly is scaffolded into 15 chromosomal pseudomolecules. The organelle genomes have also been assembled, with the mitochondrial genome 40.08 kilobases and the plastid genome 130.75 kilobases in length. A number of other prokaryote MAGs were also assembled.

Background

Epithemia pelagica is a single-celled marine pennate diatom belonging to the family Rhopalodiaceae. Similar to other species within this family ( Nakayama et al., 2011; Prechtl et al., 2004), E. pelagica hosts nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial endosymbionts, which are thought to be in the early stages of becoming an organelle ( Kneip et al., 2007; Nakayama et al., 2014). E. pelagica was first isolated from open ocean waters north of Hawai‘i, in the North Pacific Ocean ( Schvarcz et al., 2022). While this new diatom species has yet to be reported elsewhere, metagenomic analyses have detected gene sequences matching E. pelagica’s symbiont in tropical and subtropical marine habitats across the globe, suggesting this symbiosis is more widespread than currently reported.

E. pelagica is characterised by small, solitary cells measuring 6–18 µm long and 5–10 µm wide. Cells are strongly dorsiventral and asymmetrical along the apical axis, and valves are lunate with rounded apices, having a convex dorsal margin and concave ventral margin. E. pelagica differs from other species in the genus Epithemia by its minute size, weakly silicified frustules with delicate costae, and very fine striae that are not resolvable with light microscopy. E. pelagica cells typically harbor one or two endosymbionts, but cell cultures can lose their symbionts when grown for extended periods in nitrogen-rich medium. The endosymbionts lack fluorescent photosynthetic pigments and tend to be located next to the host cell’s nucleus.

The genome assemblies for E. pelagica and its endosymbiont will be a valuable resource for furthering our understanding of endosymbiosis and organellogenesis. These genomes will reveal the extent of endosymbiotic gene transfer to the diatom host and will guide future investigations of host-symbiont physiology, including the transfer of key metabolites. The genome of E. pelagica will also aid phylogenomic and evolutionary studies of the diatom order Rhopalodiales.

Genome sequence report

The genome of Epithemia pelagica strain UHM3201 was sequenced from cultured cells ( Figure 1) isolated from seawater at Station ALOHA in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean ( Schvarcz et al., 2022). A total of 298-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected eight missing joins or mis-joins and removed one haplotypic duplication, reducing the scaffold number by 14.81%.

Figure 1. Light micrograph of a live Epithemia pelagica strain UHM3201 cell.

Scale bar equals 5 µm.

The final assembly has a total length of 60.3 megabases (Mb) in 21 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 3.9 Mb ( Table 1). The snail plot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of assembly scaffolds on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (99.54%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 15 chromosomal-level scaffolds. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial and plastid genomes were also assembled (40.08 and 130.75 kilobases (kb) in size, respectively) and can be found as contigs within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

A sample of Epithemia pelagica (specimen ID DU0000022, ToLID uoEpiScrs1) was obtained from cultured cells ( Figure 1) isolated from seawater at Station ALOHA in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. The cells were collected, and the diatom species was identified by Christopher Schvarcz (University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa), Rosalina Stancheva (George Mason University), and Grieg Steward (University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa). Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation (4,000 × g for 10 min), followed by transfer to a cryovial, and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted at the Tree of Life laboratory, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI), following a sequence of core procedures: sample preparation; sample homogenisation; HMW DNA extraction; DNA fragmentation; and DNA clean-up. The uoEpiScrs1 sample was prepared on dry ice ( Jay et al., 2023). The cells were cryogenically disrupted using the Covaris cryoPREP ® Automated Dry Pulverizer ( Narváez-Gómez et al., 2023). HMW DNA was extracted using the Manual MagAttract v1 protocol ( Strickland et al., 2023b). DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 30 ( Todorovic et al., 2023). Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation ( Strickland et al., 2023a): in brief, the method employs a 1.8X ratio of AMPure PB beads to sample to eliminate shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

Protocols developed by the WSI Tree of Life laboratory are publicly available on protocols.io ( Denton et al., 2023).

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on a Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II instrument. Hi-C data were also generated from uoEpiScrs1 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly and curation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected using the gEVAL system ( Chow et al., 2016) as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using gEVAL, HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial and plastid genomes were assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial and plastid contigs, and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

The assembly of the endosymbiont uoEpiScrs1.Cyanobacterium_sp_1.1 was produced using the following pipeline: to identify cyanobacterial reads, BLAST was run of the PacBio HiFi reads of the uoEpiScrs1 sample against NCBI sequence NZ_AP018341.1 (cyanobacterium endosymbiont of Rhopalodia gibberula isolate RgSB Namiki Park) with settings "outfmt 6 -max_target_seqs 10 -max_hsps 1 -evalue 1e-25 -dust yes -lcase_masking". The tool seqkit 2.2.0 was used to isolate reads yielding BLAST hits. These reads were then assembled with Flye 2.9-b1768 with the following settings: --pacbio-hifi --meta --scaffold --keep-haplotypes. prokka 1.14.6 was used to annotate the contigs. NCBI BLAST against the nt database was run with the 16S rRNA gene sequences from this bacterial assembly. The only circular contig in the output of the assembler (contig_39) was identified as cyanobacterial (top BLAST match: "Cyanobacterium endosymbiont of Rhopalodia gibberula DNA, isolate: RgSB”). BUSCO 5.2.2 with bacteria_odb10 lineage was run with this contig. The annotation was added by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline.

The metagenome assembly was generated using metaMDBG and binned using MetaBAT2 (version 2.15-15-gd6ea400), MaxBin (version 2.7), bin3C (version 0.3.3), and MetaTOR. The resulting bin sets of each binning algorithm were individually optimized using DAS Tool (version 1.1.5) and then collectively refined using MAGScoT (version 1.0.0). PROKKA (version 1.14.5) was used to identify tRNAs and rRNAs in each bin, CheckM (version 1.2.1; checkM_DB (release 2015-01-16)) was used to assess bin completeness/contamination, and GTDB-TK (version 2.3.2; GTDB (release 214)) was used to taxonomically classify bins. Taxonomic replicate bins were identified using dRep (version 3.4.0). The final bin set was filtered for bacteria and archaea excluding the previously identified cyanobacteria. ‘MAGs’ were categorised as bins with contamination ≤ 5%, identified 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA genes along with at least 18 unique tRNAs, and either ≥ 90% completeness or ≥ 50% completeness plus fully circularised chromosomes. Remaining bins with ≤ 10% contamination and ≥ 50% completeness and ‘MAGs’ identified as taxonomic replicates were categorised as ‘binned metagenomes’.

Evaluation of the final assembly

A Hi-C map for the final E. pelagica assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

This study by Schvarcz et al. describes the genome assembly of the diatom Epithemia pelagica and its endosymbiotic bacteria. The methods used are relatively standard and common to other projects dedicated to biodiversity sequencing. The genome sequence largely meets the EBP quality standards. Congratulations.

My main remark is the lack of information concerning the management of other organisms present in the initial sample. Indeed, the assembly performed with Hifiasm allowed the assembly of the Epithemia pelagica genome, but also, I imagine, those of other bacteria present in the sample. However, it seems that the authors performed three successive assemblies: one for the host, one for the endosymbiont bacterium, and a final one for the other organisms (metagenome). I think it would have been interesting to describe what the initial assembly contains and why the authors had to use this three-step approach. For example, figures 3 and 4 are based on the cleaned assembly, which ultimately presents limited interest.

Other minor comments: I downloaded the assembly using the following accession number GCA_946965045.2 and generated basic statistics. I found minor differences with the numbers in the article: 18 scaffolds instead of 21 and a size of 60.4 Mb instead of 60.3 Mb. Can the authors explain these discrepancies?

Please add a citation: "While this new diatom species has yet to be reported elsewhere, metagenomic analyses have detected gene sequences matching E. pelagica’s symbiont in tropical and subtropical marine habitats across the globe, suggesting this symbiosis is more widespread than currently reported."

What do the authors mean by "manually assembled"?: "The genome of the cyanobacterial endosymbiont of E. pelagica (Chroococcales: Aphanothecaceae) was manually assembled..."

The authors used the stramenopiles BUSCO dataset, but it contains fewer genes than the eukaryotic one (100 vs 255). Is there a specific reason for this choice?

Adkins et al. presented a high-quality genome of Epithemia pelagica and its endosymbionts, valuable for studying diatom-cyanobacteria symbiosis. I have a few minor comments:

1. Citation: For the claim “metagenomic analyses have detected gene sequences matching E. pelagica’s symbiont in tropical and subtropical marine habitats across the globe,” include a citation.

2. Introduction: The introduction lacks an in-depth discussion of the genome’s importance. Consider citing Coale et al. (2024) for context.

The data  note on genome sequencing of a marine diatom is well presented and soundly analyzed. Besides the genome description, the authors also provided the metagenomes using the "bin" strategy. As data report, there is no discussion or an evolutive perspective, which is expected. The only (very minor) flaw is  that the metagenome results could also bring some information on the core genes found, for example. This information is also descriptive and should have been added to the metagenome description.
