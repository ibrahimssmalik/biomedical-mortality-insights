pmcTo the Editor,

Peritonitis, a frequent complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD), concerns both patients and nephrology teams due to its impact on patient and technique survivals, as well as quality of life [1]. Investigating artificial intelligence measures in the field of PD is essential [2], potentially aiding in organizing preventive measures such as home visits, especially in centers where the policy is to visit the patient's home [3]. The objective of this proof of concept study is to demonstrate that a machine-learning (ML) algorithm assists in scheduling home visits based on the risk of peritonitis.

Fifteen clinical and laboratory variables from the Thai Peritoneal Dialysis Outcome and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS), an international prospective cohort study aimed at identifying optimal practices for maintenance PD, were used to train the ML algorithm for generating a risk-based patient visit sequence. This dataset comprised 546 patients, 50% male, with a mean age of 56 ± 14 years, a peritonitis rate of 21%, and a mean risk score of 0.29 ± 0.18 across 22 sites. The study rationale and methods of Thailand PDOPPS have been previously published [4]. The top five features of importance in the algorithm included hemoglobin standard deviation (SD), bicarbonate trend, potassium SD, sodium last, and diastolic blood pressure trend. Subsequently, the ML-generated risk-based sequence was validated using data from two hospitals: (i) Banphaeo Hospital (Hospital B) with 753 patients, 53% male, mean age 59 ± 13 years, peritonitis rate 32%, and mean risk score 0.23 ± 0.16, and (ii) Samutprakan Hospital (Hospital S) with 238 patients, 50% male, mean age 56 ± 14 years, peritonitis rate 18%, and mean risk score 0.19 ± 0.11.

The ML algorithm generated risk scores for estimating the likelihood of peritonitis in patients undergoing PD. These risk scores were derived from regression models, with high-risk patients having scores near 1.00 and low-risk patients having scores near 0.00. The performance of ML algorithm was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves, resulting in an ROC of 0.74 and a PR of 0.42. An ROC of 0.74 suggests moderate discrimination ability of the ML algorithm in distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk patients. Similarly, a PR of 0.42 indicates a moderate precision in identifying high-risk cases among those predicted by the model. Additionally, the comparison between risk-based sequencing and traditional home-visit methods in Hospital B and Hospital S settings revealed significant differences. The correlation coefficients (Spearman's r) for Hospital B and Hospital S were −0.02 and 0.16, respectively. A correlation coefficient close to zero indicates little to no correlation between the two methods, suggesting that their approaches to patient prioritization diverge significantly in both settings. For example, patients at Hospitals B and S with high-risk scores (0.76 and 0.60) were advanced from 18th and 17th in the traditional sequences to sixth and first, respectively, in the priority list. Conversely, patients at Hospitals B and S with low-risk scores (0.14 and 0.60) were moved down from first and second in the traditional sequences to 461st and 54th, respectively, in the risk-based sequence (Fig. 1).

Figure 1: Top 50 sequences prioritized for visiting PD patients of Hospital B and Hospital S.

Although this ML-generated risk-based patient visit tool is innovative, some limitations are worth mentioning. First, several variables known to be associated with an increased risk of peritonitis (e.g. comorbidities, residual kidney function, PD vintage) were omitted due to missing data since the collection of PD patient data was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially affecting the model's accuracy [5]. Second, the traditional home visits conducted by Hospitals B and S might not have been decided at random or by the calendar time; the sequence might have been based on the nurses' subjective assessments of the patients’ needs. Third, based on the limited evidence available to date, the effect of home visits on reducing peritonitis risk remains uncertain. The significant differences observed between risk-based sequencing and traditional home-visit methods underscore the potential benefits of adopting data-driven approaches to patient care management. However, further research may be needed to enhance the predictive accuracy and practical utility of the ML algorithm in clinical settings to reduce peritonitis rate.

In conclusion, our ML model, derived from a robust dataset, demonstrates promise in prioritizing PD patient home visits. The algorithm should be considered as a tool among other tools that help nephrology teams identify patients at risk of peritonitis. Further studies are needed to explore its effectiveness in enhancing PD care outcomes.
