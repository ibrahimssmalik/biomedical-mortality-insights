For designing single-molecule devices that have both conjugation systems and structural flexibility, a hyperconjugated molecule with a σ–π bond interaction is considered an ideal candidate. In the investigation of conductance at the single-molecule level, since few hyperconjugation systems have been involved, the strategy of building hyperconjugation systems and the mechanism of electron transport within this system remain unexplored. Based on the skipped-conjugated structure, we present a rational approach to construct a hyperconjugation molecule using a hydroxyl group, which serves as a bridge to interact with the conjugated fragments. The measurement of single-molecule conductance reveals a two-fold conductance enhancement of the hyperconjugation system having the ‘bridging’ hydroxyl group compared to hydroxyl-free derivatives. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the hydroxyl group in the hyperconjugation system connects the LUMO of the two conjugated fragments and opens a through-space channel for electron transport to enhance the conductance.

pmc1. Introduction

Aiming at the miniaturization of electric devices, the development of molecular electronics depends on fabricating molecular devices with highly conductive molecules [1,2,3,4]. Since the π orbital has the energetic advantages in electron transport, the strategies to design molecules performing high conductance are usually based on the fully conjugated structures, including the introduction of constructive quantum interference [5,6,7], the construction of self-gating systems [8,9,10] and the ‘topological insulator’ built by the radical system [11,12]. However, despite the good performance in electric properties, the conjugated structures which bring in high structural rigidity prevent the conformational transition that offers the opportunities to modulate the conductance through folded structures, for instance, intramolecular π–π stacking [13,14,15]. Thus, exploring a strategy to design molecules having the feature of conjugation and structural flexibility synchronously is of great significance.

Hyperconjugation, which refers to the interaction between σ- and π-orbital, introduces the delocalized molecular orbitals in non-conjugated structures [16,17,18,19,20]. Although it is a promising candidate for combining structural flexibility with conjugated backbones in designing single-molecule devices, the molecular structures containing a hyperconjugation system are rarely investigated [21,22]. In particular, the mechanism of electron transport in a hyperconjugation system is still unclear. Therefore, designing a molecule with π–σ hyperconjugation to explore the mechanism of electron transport in this system is of great importance in developing high-performance single-molecule devices.

Here we report a hyperconjugation system based on a skipped-conjugation structure [23] with a non-conjugated hydroxyl group as a ‘bridge’ to connect the conjugated fragments. The distinct enhancement of conductance for the hydroxyl-contained hyperconjugation systems was confirmed by comparison with that for the corresponding hydroxyl-free derivatives. Theoretical studies demonstrated that hyperconjugation, in which the anti-bonding orbital (σ*) of the C-O (hydroxyl group) bond interacts with the anti-bonding orbital (π*) of the adjacent conjugated structure, builds the interaction between the hydroxyl group and the two conjugated fragments and connects the two fragments, thus opening a new through-space channel for the transmission of electrons to enhance the conductance.

2. Results

To clarify the role of hyperconjugation playing in single-molecule conductance, we elaborately designed two groups of directly comparable molecules in this work, as depicted in Figure 1. Molecule 1, containing one hydroxyl group as the ‘bridge’ to link the two conjugated fragments (phenylethenyl groups), was designed and synthesized according to the reported methods [24,25,26,27]. As a structural reference, the hydroxyl group was replaced by the carbonyl group to link the two conjugated fragments in molecule 2 [28]. Upon the removal of the hydroxyl group, we obtained molecule 3 with methylene to space the conjugated fragments. Molecules 4–6 were designed as the structural derivatives of molecules 1–3 with the ethenyl groups in the former replaced by the ethynyl groups in the latters, respectively. The single-molecule conductance was measured using the scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM-BJ) technique in the 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene (TCB) solution containing 0.1 mM of the prepared molecules.

As shown in Figure 1, the most probable conductance of molecule 1 is 10−4.85 G0 (1.09 nS, G0 represents the quantum conductance and equals 77,500 nS) [23], which is lower than the conductance of molecule 2 (10−4.29 G0, 3.97 nS) and higher than the conductance of molecule 3 (10−5.10 G0, 0.62 nS). This implies that, compared to the fully conjugated molecule 2, breaking the conjugated system with a saturated carbon atom at the central site of molecule 1 suppresses the conductance effectively. However, compared with molecule 3, the existence of the hydroxyl group enhances the conductance as the conductance of molecule 1 is about two times as high as that of molecule 3 [29]. This conductance modulation is observed not only in ethenyl-connected molecules 1–3, but also characterized in ethynyl-connected molecules 4–6. The conductance of hydroxyl group-bridged molecule 4 (10−5.05 G0, 0.69 nS) is also lower than that of fully conjugated molecule 5 (10−4.42 G0, 2.95 nS), but higher than that of hydroxyl-free molecule 6 (10−5.40 G0, 0.31 nS).

To find the origin of the conductance enhancement by the hydroxyl group in skipped-conjugated structures, the junction length was investigated because the conductance is very sensitive to a change in the junction length. Since the conductive backbone of molecules 1–6 are almost the same, the variation of the statistical junction lengths of molecules 1–6 is relatively small, and are 1.04, 0.87, 1.03, 0.90, 1.02 and 0.88 nm, respectively. The measured junction lengths (1.54, 1.37, 1.53, 1.40, 1.52 and 1.38 nm for molecules 1–6, Figure S17) match well with the simulated S-S distances (1.51, 1.59, 1.40, 1.43, 1.48 and 1.46 nm for molecules 1–6) after correcting the junction length using a 0.5 nm ‘snap-back’ length [30]. With such as small length fluctuation, the contribution of the junction length is negligible in the conductance enhancement by the hydroxyl group.

Molecular orbitals, especially the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) such as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are crucial to the conductance magnitude [29]. To investigate the influence of the hydroxyl group on the FMOs, the theoretical studies were conducted using density functional theory (DFT). The geometry optimization and orbital calculations of molecules 1–5 are performed by the Gaussian16 package [31], while the theoretical study of molecule 6 was reported in the previous research [29]. The electronic structure of the FMOs, which is highly correlated to the conductive property, was analyzed by simulating the distribution of HOMO and LUMO. In molecules 3 and 6, the reported study shows an imbalanced distribution in both HOMO and LUMO (Figure S16) [32]. In particular, the central carbon atom, which skips the conjugated system, plays the role of a node to divide the structure into two conjugated fragments with no orbital distributed on it. Despite there being still no orbital distribution on this atom in HOMO, the orbital distribution of the two conjugated fragments in molecules 1–2 and 4–5 is connected through it in LUMO when a hydroxyl group is substituted. This results in orbital distribution in the skipped-conjugated molecules 1 and 4 is visually the same as that of fully conjugated molecules 2 and 5, respectively (Figure 2).

The transmission coefficients (T(E)) and the transmission pathway for the electron, which investigated the relationship between the electronic structure and the conductance, were calculated by combining density functional theory (DFT) with non-equilibrium Green’s functions (NEGF), where the Green’s function estimates the behavior of the electron wave in a single molecule and yields the T(E) [12,33,34,35]. The molecular junctions of 1–5 were simulated while the junction of molecule 6 was reported in previous work [29]. As shown in Figure 3, the transmission coefficients, which closely correspond with the single-molecule conductance, at a Fermi energy of (E − EF = 0 eV), decrease following the sequence of 2 > 5 > 1 > 4 > 3, which matches well with the sequence of the measured single-molecule conductance. More importantly, in the curves of the transmission coefficient for these molecules, the peaks representing LUMO are closer to EF than the peaks of HOMO. This indicates that, for the corresponding molecules, the conductance is dominated by LUMO, which is also found in molecule 6 in the previous study. Hence, since the hydroxyl group connects the two conjugated fragments forming a delocalized system, the LUMO provides a continuous channel for the electron to transport from the source to the drain, which is explicitly demonstrated in the transmission pathway [36]. As shown in Figure 3b, a broad arrow between the two carbon atoms connecting the central carbon atom, which indicates the strong through-space transmission of electrons between the end atom of the two conjugated fragments, is observed in molecules 1, 2, 4 and 5, while no such a through-space transmission is characterized in molecules 3 and 6. The strong through-space transmission reveals that the connection of the two conjugated fragments in LUMO opens an extra transmission channel for the electron, enhancing the conductance.

Finally, the hyperconjugation effect was employed to elucidate the origin of the enhanced conductance facilitated by the hydroxyl group connecting the two conjugated systems [17,18,37]. Hyperconjugation refers to the interaction between the σ– and π–orbital [19]. In molecules 1 and 4, the simulated electronic structures demonstrate the formation of the extended LUMO. The unsaturated C–C bonds (ethenyl or ethynyl group) offer the anti–bonding orbital (π*) and the C–O (hydroxyl group) bond also provides the anti−bonding orbital (σ*). In molecular structure, as the unsaturated C–C bonds connect to the carbon atom of the C–O bond, the matched phase of the π* and σ* results in parts of the π* orbital hybridizing with parts of the σ* orbital, which eventually extended the conjugation system in the skipped–conjugated structure.

3.2. STM-BJ Method

The single-molecule conductance was measured by scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM-BJ) technique using commercially available STM-BJ equipment provided by VR (Xiamen) Technology Co., Ltd. (Xiamen, China) in the 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene (TCB) solution containing 0.1 mM of synthesized molecule [40]. The bias voltage applied between electrodes was 100 mV [33,41]. The retraction rate of electrodes was calibrated using the reported method in pure TCB solvent as a blank experiment (Figure S13) [42].

3.3. Computational Details

Geometry optimizations and orbital simulations of molecules were carried out by the Gaussian 16 software [31] based on the density functional theory (DFT) method employing the function of B3LYP with a 6-311+g (d,p) basis set and the vibrational frequencies were also calculated simultaneously with the same theoretical level to make sure that all the optimized configurations had the lowest energies. The DFT combined with non-equilibrium Green’s functions (NEGF) was used to simulate the transmission coefficient that corresponded to the transport properties.

The curves of the transmission coefficient were calculated by first-principles calculations using the Quantum Atomistix ToolKit software package, U-2022.12 version. The two electrodes, which were constructed from gold (111) surfaces, consisted of a unit cell of 5 × 5 with an extension region thickness of five layers to avoid strong interactions with electrodes. A pyramid-shaped gold tip was built to simulate the stable contact with anchors on both gold electrode sides. The above optimized molecular structures were then transformed between two electrodes to construct the single-molecule devices. For the initial configuration of the device, the distances between the sulfur atom and the top gold atom were controlled at ~2.5 Å. In the following optimized process, the coordinates of the gold tip atoms were frozen and molecular skeletons were kept rigid to save the computational cost and maintain the optimal conformation of the molecular structure. The exchange-correlation Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerh (PBE) parameterization was employed in the simulations of the molecular device. In the simulation, the double-ζ basis set was adopted for gold atoms while the double-ζ polarization basis functions were applied to the other atoms. To meet the requirement of estimating the Au electrode system, the energy cutoff was set to 200 Ry. At zero bias voltage, the geometry optimization was optimized to meet the convergence criterion of 0.02 eV/A. The k point with a grid of (4 × 3 × 200) was set and a bias energy range from −3 eV to 3 eV was adopt in the transmission spectrum calculation.

4. Conclusions

We designed skipped-conjugated molecules using a hydroxyl group to build a hyperconjugation system. Single-molecule conductance measurements revealed an approximate two-fold conductance enhancement in the hyperconjugation system containing the ‘bridging’ hydroxyl group compared to the corresponding hydroxyl-free derivatives. The theoretical investigations demonstrated that the hydroxyl group in the skipped-conjugated structures (molecules 1 and 4) set up a ‘bridge’ between the two conjugated fragments in LUMO, resulting in the visual similarity of the frontier orbitals to that of the fully conjugated structures (molecules 2 and 5). Transmission studies further manifested that the connected orbitals of the two conjugated fragments in LUMO opened a through-space channel for electron transport and eventually enhanced the conductance. This study offers a rational strategy for designing hyperconjugation systems that integrate the benefits of conjugation and structural flexibility into a single molecule, thus providing insight into how the hyperconjugation systems facilitate electron transport in single-molecule devices.
