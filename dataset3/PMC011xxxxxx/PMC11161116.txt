Considerable spatial heterogeneity has been observed in COVID-19 transmission across administrative areas of England throughout the pandemic. This study investigates what drives these differences. We constructed a probabilistic case count model for 306 administrative areas of England across 95 weeks, fit using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework. We incorporate the impact of acquired immunity, of spatial exportation of cases, and 16 spatially-varying socio-economic, socio-demographic, health, and mobility variables. Model comparison assesses the relative contributions of these respective mechanisms. We find that spatially-varying and time-varying differences in week-to-week transmission were definitively associated with differences in: time spent at home, variant-of-concern proportion, and adult social care funding. However, model comparison demonstrates that the impact of these terms is negligible compared to the role of spatial exportation between administrative areas. While these results confirm the impact of some, but not all, static measures of spatially-varying inequity in England, our work corroborates the finding that observed differences in disease transmission during the pandemic were predominantly driven by underlying epidemiological factors rather than aggregated metrics of demography and health inequity between areas. Further work is required to assess how health inequity more broadly contributes to these epidemiological factors.

Author summary

During the COVID-19 pandemic, different geographic areas of England saw different patterns in the number of confirmed cases over time. This study investigated whether demographic differences between these areas (such as the amount of deprivation, the age and ethnicity of the populations, or differences in where people spent their time) were linked to these differences in disease transmission. We also considered whether this was associated with the number of cases in neighbouring areas as well. Using a mathematical model fit to multiple data streams, we discovered that a statistically significant link between some demographic variables (time spent at home, COVID-19 variant, and the amount of adult social care funding) and week-to-week transmission exists, but this relationship is very small, and the influence of cases in neighbouring areas was far more impactful in explaining differences in transmission between areas over time.

pmcIntroduction

During the COVID-19 pandemic, measures of deprivation have been identified as impacting health outcomes, with more deprived areas reporting higher COVID-19 attributed mortality, both in England [1] and globally [2]. Less well-understood is the impact these measures have on disease incidence–confirmed cases. Descriptive studies early in the pandemic identified that English administrative areas with a higher Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) reported more cases of COVID-19 than those with lower IMD scores [3,4] during the first wave of disease incidence in 2020. However, such patterns do not persist throughout the entire epidemic, and for some periods the opposite trend can now be observed (Fig 1B).

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012141.g001 Fig 1 Variation in socio-demographic factors by LTLA, and the respective differences in average per capita incidence of COVID-19 cases when stratified by these socio-demographic factors.

(A/C) Plots depict how IMD and White British population proportion vary across the 306 English LTLAs we consider. (B/D) The 306 considered LTLAs are partitioned into quintiles (blue being the lowest values quintile and red the highest values quintile) based on their (B) IMD scores and (D) White British population proportion respectively. Lines display the mean per capita weekly incidence of COVID-19 across all LTLAs in each quintile. Shaded regions depict the 95% quantiles. Quintile binning in plots B/D is for illustrative purposes—model fitting is performed to the continuous measures presented in plots A/C.

England is divided into Lower Tier Local Authorities (LTLA)–areas of social service provisioning (see section 1.1 of S1 Appendix). For these different areas, data is available on the socio-demographic makeup–the average age, ethnic population proportions, population density; on socio-economic metrics–median earnings, employment, education; and epidemiological data throughout the pandemic–daily new cases, variant proportions, COVID-19 support funding allocated, and mobility data recording time spent at different locations. These variables vary greatly across LTLAs, and similarly disease incidence and rates of infection have varied across LTLAs during the pandemic [5]. Fig 1 demonstrates spatial variation in two covariates of interest, and mean per capita weekly incidence of COVID-19 stratified by these variables (see section 1.6 of S1 Appendix for plots of other covariates). Some variables change weekly (community mobility, variant proportion), others change annually (funding allocation, income), while others are fixed by LTLA for the entire duration.

Recognising the variation in disease incidence across administrative areas, the UK government briefly implemented a tiered lockdown system on October 14th 2020 [6], where more stringent rules on social mixing were applied to areas of the country with a greater incidence of COVID-19. This system was retired the following month for a second nationwide stay-at-home order. It remains unclear as to whether these observed epidemiological differences can be explained solely by spatial drivers of disease spread, or whether the intrinsic factors associated with each LTLA influenced the epidemic trajectory in each respective LTLA. Hypothetically, for example, populations in wealthier LTLAs may have been more able to work from home, or may have had more access to space to self-isolate in. LTLAs with a higher proportion of elderly residents may have been more susceptible to infection, or may have seen less social mixing. LTLAs that received more COVID-19 support funding per head, may have subsequently achieved better disease suppression.

Here, we model the number of weekly pillar 2 (general population testing) PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases in 306 English LTLAs, for 95 weeks, from the week beginning May 10th 2020 to the week beginning February 27th 2022. We assume the number of weekly cases in an LTLA is determined by the previous week’s number of cases, plus a proportion of imported infections from adjacent LTLAs controlled by a model parameter. Additional model parameters then control the relative influence of 16 socio-economic and -demographic variables, and time- and LTLA- varying terms on the observed increases and decreases in cases. Model parameters are fit to English COVID-19 surveillance data by LTLA through a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework.

Real-time modelling studies provided valuable insights and projections into key epidemiological parameters throughout the pandemic [7], through regular reports integrating the latest epidemiological data. In this study we investigate how the composition of a population, and population-level covariates, contributes to week-to-week transmission potential. Identification of such contributions would inform whether real-time-modelling efforts could be improved in the future by integrating such socio-economic and -demographic data.

Results

Model fit

The model successfully captured the variation in LTLA-specific epidemic trajectories. Fig 2A sums the model fit across all 306 LTLAs, while plots 2B and 2C show the model fit, for example, to the two LTLAs with the greatest variation in their epidemic trajectory as assessed via dynamic time warping (DTW) distance [8] (a metric for analysing similarity in time series data). All LTLAs see broadly three principle epidemic waves, initiated by the emergence of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants respectively.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012141.g002 Fig 2 Model fit to data, at national level and two LTLAs as examples.

(A) The number of weekly new COVID-19 cases in England, summing the model fit across all 306 LTLAs. (B/C) The per capita weekly incidence of COVID-19 in two specific LTLAs with greatly different epidemic trajectories. Black dots show data and the blue line represents mean model fit. Shaded blue regions depict the 95% credible intervals (CrI). Dashed lines represent significant changes in nationwide non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed [9]. As shaded in the top bar, red areas depict times of full “stay-at-home” orders, orange depicts partial restrictions on social mixing, green depicts no barriers to social mixing.

The effective reproduction number, Ri,teff, is an epidemiological parameter dictating the number of secondary infections caused by a primary infection in LTLA i at week t. Hence, when Ri,teff>1, cases are observed to increase in LTLA i at week t. Likewise, when Ri,teff<1, cases are observed to decrease. Our model assumes that Ri,teff is made up of three principle elements. First, a time-varying random walk term, zt, observed across all LTLAs, capturing the impact of multiple time-varying factors such as changes to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), vaccination uptake, school closures, and national holidays. Second, an LTLA-varying error term, θi, to capture any unexplained intrinsic differences between the reproduction number across LTLAs. Third, a term capturing the impact of 16 covariates of interest–data compiled from multiple sources (see Section 1 of the S1 Appendix) capturing: the population ethnicity proportions, the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) scores, the population age proportions, the population densities, the median annual incomes, the time spent at certain locations, the proportion of new COVID-19 variants, and the amount of COVID-19 funding allocated, across all 306 LTLAs considered. The impact of these variables is captured in the term xi,t β, where xi,t represents the 16 covariates introduced above for LTLA i at week t, and β is a model parameter of coefficients controlling the relative contributions of each of the 16 covariates.

Fig 3 shows the mean and 95% CrI of the posterior distributions for these covariate coefficients (parameter β above). Model covariates (xi,t) were standardised to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 before model fitting to enable comparison of relative covariate coefficients.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012141.g003 Fig 3 Posterior estimates of all covariate coefficients (parameter β).

These values are separated into three categories: those capturing population effects, those capturing variants-of-concern, and those capturing funding allocations. Black dots represent the mean estimate, black lines the 95% CrI. The dashed grey line marks 0. A positive value indicates that the effective reproduction number increases with higher values of the associated covariate, a negative value indicates that the effective reproduction number decreases with higher values of the associated covariate.

Unsurprisingly, the time spent at home was the strongest covariate effect (outside of COVID-19 variant) in determining changes to transmission. LTLAs and weeks where populations spent more time in residential areas saw reduced effective reproduction numbers. Similarly, LTLA-weeks with more visits to (non-home) workplaces saw increased reproduction numbers. Additionally, the LTLAs with greater allocations of Adult Social Care (ASC) infection control funding per head saw reduced reproduction numbers.

Each new variant was associated with a sequential increase in the reproduction number, in alignment with similar studies into the transmission potential of each variant [10].

Our analyses suggested there was no statistically significant impact on the effective reproduction number by population ethnicity proportions, IMD, population proportion over the age of 65, population density, median annual income, visits to transit stations, un-ringfenced funding or Contain Outbreak Management Fund (COMF) funding allocated–all these coefficients’ 95% CrI overlaps 0 in Fig 3.

Our model also assumes that the number of weekly cases in an LTLA is not just driven by the previous weekly number of cases in that LTLA, but that some new infections can be triggered by infections in adjacent LTLAs. This is a process known as spatial exportation, whereby a primary case in one LTLA may visit a neighbouring LTLA, and subsequently cause a secondary infection outside of their home boundaries. We assume that the proportion of spatial importations varies by LTLA, as some areas, like city centres, may attract more visitors than other, more rural, LTLAs. The model parameter ζi is defined as the proportion of all weekly cases in adjacent LTLAs that contribute secondary infections each week in LTLA i.

Fig 4 shows the impact of all other model variables that contribute to the effective reproduction number–the proportion of case importations from neighbouring LTLAs, ζi, (median value 0.134, interquartile range (IQR) 0.069–0.247) the LTLA-varying error terms θi (median value 0.028, IQR -0.159–0.222), and the time-varying random walk trajectory, zt (median value -0.489, IQR -0.871 - -0.243). Fig 4A shows that the majority of LTLAs imported only a small proportion of cases from neighbouring LTLAs—LTLAs shaded in blue saw less than 20% of the total cases in LTLAs they share a border with causing onwards infections within their own boundaries. Denser populated LTLAs like city centres have higher ζi values in general, (areas shaded red in Fig 4A) demonstrating the increased transmission risk caused by individuals travelling into population centres from more rural LTLAs. The greatest contribution of the three terms comprising our Ri,teff is thus the random walk term, followed by the covariate impacts and LTLA-specific error term θi.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012141.g004 Fig 4 Model variables contributing to the LTLA-varying and week-varying effective reproduction number.

(A) Estimates of the LTLA-varying parameter ζi, denoting what proportion of the cases in adjacent LTLAs cause secondary cases in LTLA i the following week. (B) The remaining spatial error term, θi, capturing underlying differences in LTLA reproduction numbers not explained by the sixteen considered covariates (xi,t−1 β). (C) The random walk term applied to all LTLAs capturing a baseline time-varying change to the reproduction number. Solid line shows the mean estimate and the shaded region the 95% CrI.

Fig 4B shows the spatial variation in the reproduction number that is not explained by the 16 covariates (xi,t−1). The apparent clustering of higher and lower θi values suggests this pattern may not simply be noise, but that there could be spatial variables yet to be identified that may also be influencing the transmission of COVID-19 across LTLAs in England.

Fig 4C shows the random walk trajectory over time. There are multiple time-varying aspects that will have influenced the epidemic in England. We specifically include COVID-19 variant proportions, and our mobility covariates have been shown to capture the influence of NPIs over time [11]. Fig 4C demonstrates a gradual decrease in the background effective reproduction number for all LTLAs, in line with the uptake in vaccination and changes in behaviour.

Model comparison

To assess the relative contribution of each of these modelled mechanisms towards improving model fit, the model is fit multiple times with some mechanisms removed.

Alongside the main analysis (MA) presented above, where all model terms are included, three additional sensitivity analyses are presented: (SA1) we fit the model without any covariates included–i.e. β is hard-coded to 0, (SA2) we fit the model with no spatial exportation included (but covariates are still included)–i.e. ζi is hard-coded to 0, (SA3) we fit the model with no spatial exportation or covariates included–i.e. both β and ζi are fixed at 0. θi and zt remain in all three sensitivities.

Model comparison is performed using the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd) metric under a “leave future out” (LFO) cross-validation scheme, detailed in section 4.2 of the S1 Appendix. elpd (LFO) assesses the relative goodness of fit and predictive performance of different model versions by evaluating each model’s ability to predict held-out future sections of the time series. Higher elpd (LFO) values (lower magnitude) indicate better model performance.

The elpd (LFO) values for the main analysis (MA) and three sensitivity analyses (SA1-3) are shown in Table 1 below. A greater elpd (LFO) value suggests a better model fit.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012141.t001 Table 1 Model comparison via the elpd leave-future-out cross-validation measure.

A greater value suggests a better model fit. “Spatial importation excluded” indicates that ζi is fixed to 0, and “covariates excluded” indicates that β is fixed to 0. When included these are both fit model parameters.

Model Formulation	elpd (LFO) value (point estimate / standard error)	
(MA) Spatial importation included, covariates included.	-81,006 (SE 505)	
(SA1) Spatial importation included, covariates excluded.	-81,124 (SE 502)	
(SA2) Spatial importation excluded, covariates included.	-83,945 (SE 667)	
(SA3) Spatial importation excluded, covariates excluded.	-84,018 (SE 666)	

The greatest elpd value, and hence the best performing model, is the main analysis (MA), containing both a nearest-neighbour spatial importation mechanism, and population / variant / funding covariates. This is to be expected as the sensitivities are nested models of the main analysis, and the elpd does not directly penalise increased model complexity. However, the improvement offered by including the model covariates (MA vs. SA1, and, SA2 vs. SA3) is insignificant once the standard errors in the elpd estimates are considered, and therefore not worth the complexity trade-off of their inclusion. The improvement offered by the inclusion of spatial importation mechanisms however (an estimated elpd increase of 2,939, MA vs. SA2) are significant, and support the inclusion of spatial importation as important to explaining variation in disease incidence between LTLAs.

Other model formulations are included as supplementary results for comparison in section 4 of the S1 Appendix, including alternate spatial kernels, alternate data sources, univariate models, and consideration of different reporting assumptions.

Discussion

Our study explored the informative potential of multiple spatially varying health inequity, socio-demographic, and socio-economic factors on week-to-week transmission potential within a population. We investigated how these variables related to the observed differences in COVID-19 week-to-week transmission across 306 administrative areas of England over a period of 95 weeks. In conclusion, the majority of these variables were not found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 transmission; however, we did detect a significant association for two population variables–the time spent at home, and the number of visits to workplaces, and one funding variable–the amount of ASC infection control funding allocated per head to an LTLA.

Starting with ethnicity, Black and South Asian populations have been shown to have increased COVID-19 mortality risk [12]. In their global systematic review of the impact of ethnicity on COVID-19 health outcomes, Irizar et al. (2023) [13] report mixed results when comparing the risk of infection for Asian and “other” ethnicity populations with White majority populations, in accordance with our results in Fig 3. However, they show a far more conclusive increased relative risk in Black populations compared to white majority populations. Our results suggest a mild decrease in week-to-week transmission potential for LTLAs with a higher proportion of Black African / Caribbean residents on average (though still statistically insignificant). One possible explanation is that put forward by Harris & Brunsdon (2021) [14], who show that the distribution of COVID-19 cases by ethnicity changes over time in England, with Black populations reporting far higher relative incidence during the peak of the first wave, before then changing to capturing the minority of cases proportionally. Similarly, Mathur et al. (2021) [15] report a lower risk of infection in Black populations compared to White populations during the second wave. They demonstrate this is likely due to the heterogeneity in spatial incidence over time. Our study both directly factors for spatial heterogeneity in incidence and considers a longer time period than these studies investigating this association, potentially explaining our finding. Section 4.3 of the S1 Appendix shows that the mean coefficient magnitude for the population Black African / Caribbean proportion is further reduced in the absence of all other covariates, suggesting that some degree of covariate correlation is also influencing the estimated importance of the covariate.

Crucially; however, care must be taken when comparing our results to those of community-targeted infection risk studies. Population prevalence studies, such as the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) studies, and those conducted via the OpenSAFELY platform, directly investigate how COVID-19 prevalence differed by demographic indicators like those considered in this study. Ward et al. (2021) [16] identified a three-fold increase in testing antibody-positive within Black populations compared to White populations (reducing to two-fold when adjusted for confounding factors such as age, sex, IMD quintile, household size). Mathur et al. (2021) [15] identified a similar risk for the period February 1st–August 3rd 2020, though this increased risk is not identified for the “second wave” of September 1st–December 31st 2020. Such results should not be directly compared to the findings of this study, which investigates a fundamentally different result–we do not consider denominator populations, or individual-level infection results; rather, we consider how the composition of a population contributes to week-to-week transmission potential.

Our results also show an inconclusive impact of IMD on transmission, though lean towards higher reproduction numbers seen in more deprived areas. In their systematic review of socioeconomic COVID-19 impacts, Benita et al. (2022) [17] list only nine UK-specific studies, and report a global trend of mixed and inconclusive findings as to the impact of poverty metrics on COVID-19 infection. The trend we have shown in Fig 1B, of differences in case incidence by deprivation quantiles seeming pronounced in some time periods, before reversing in others is seen in multiple other countries [18,19].

The strong negative effect of the “time spent at home” variable is unsurprising given its inherent epidemiological importance, and its direct impact on disease cases has been demonstrated for multiple countries [20]. While this variable predominantly changes temporally in relation to NPI measures, strong variation is also observed across LTLAs at any given time point (see section 1.6 of S1 Appendix). While it is possible that the impact of some other covariates is captured within the “time spent at home” variable, i.e. LTLAs with higher incomes also see more time spent at home on average, additional sensitivity analyses exploring the removal of this variable in the S1 Appendix (section 4.3) shows that results are broadly unchanged by their inclusion.

Of the three COVID-19 funding pools provided during the pandemic that we consider, only the ASC infection control fund proved significant. COMF funds are provided for activities such as targeted testing of hard-to-reach bodies, additional contact tracing, community support, communication materials, as well as enforcement and compliance expenditure [21]. The ASC infection control fund meanwhile was specifically for use in preventing onward transmission in care home settings. As with many European countries, care homes in England were hit particularly hard during the first wave of the epidemic in England [22], motivating this specific fund. Our results show that this specific targeting of the most vulnerable populations was effective in reducing transmission and is the first study to our knowledge to investigate the associated impact of these funding provisions. All funding allocations were informed by the specific health needs and population demographics of respective LTLAs, meaning that some covariates such as IMD and age distribution will have some degree of correlation.

To investigate the time-specific impact of these covariates, we conducted a sensitivity analysis whereby the model was fit to three distinct subsections of the overall time series (section 4.5 of the S1 Appendix). Our results are unchanged across specific time periods, save for the significance of the ASC infection control fund disappearing for August 8th 2021 onwards, as would be expected, as this was when NPIs had been lifted.

Section 1.7 of the S1 Appendix presents the degree of autocorrelation present amongst variables. This unavoidable aspect of the dataset is a limitation of the study; however, we address this through multiple supplementary sensitivity analyses including univariate model formulations. All fundamental results presented in this study are maintained under these sensitivities, save for the impact of IMD, which does achieve statistical significance upon exclusion of the other fifteen covariates.

We have not included vaccination directly, as the vaccination rollout was itself influenced by the epidemic trajectory, with greater dose uptake encouraged in response to novel variants [23]. As such, since our model does not mechanistically include the effect of vaccination, nor the impact of waning effectiveness, the random walk term will capture both the uptake and impact of vaccination, but also unique temporal aspects such as public holidays, sporting events, seasonal patterns, and others. We see in general a reduction in the reproduction number over time, in line with the vaccine rollout, but also note increases in December likely aligned with the Christmas holidays, and other adjustments such as an increase in June/July 2021 around the time of the UEFA European Football Championship [24], followed by a drop after the event.

A caveat of this study is the heterogeneity within each LTLA for some covariates of interest. LTLAs are areas of geographic administration and service provisioning, and as such differ in population sizes. While many LTLAs are close to the median LTLA population size of 142,622 people (IQR 104,869–237,616, see section 1.8 of the S1 Appendix), some outliers are considerably different, the largest being Birmingham with a population of 1,140,525. Heterogeneity in covariates, such as IMD, within these larger LTLAs can be observed at the Lower layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) scale, of 32,844 areas in England, however COVID-19 case data at this scale is too sparse to model. Thus, the LTLA-scale considered demonstrates a trade-off between demographic detail, data availability, and modelling feasibility.

We also note a modelling assumption made whereby reported “first episodes” of disease incidence in an LTLA contributed to fully immunising protection against onwards infection. While protection against repeat infection was strong for the majority of the time period we considered [25], this was likely to wane more against the Omicron variant. We explored this modelling assumption through multiple sensitivity analyses where the model was fit to different time periods, and where waning of acquired immunity was assumed, which are presented in sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the S1 Appendix. Our model results were unchanged in these analyses.

The overarching question motivating this study was whether population health and demographic variables held informative potential such that their inclusion might improve real-time modelling efforts that currently do not incorporate such data streams. Only a minority of covariates were found to be impactful, and the improvement to model fit they offer is insignificant. However, substantive improvements are offered by including mechanisms of spatial spread. Detailed study of lineage exports by Kraemer et al. (2021) [26] have previously demonstrated how human travel alone was able to explain the spatial heterogeneity observed during the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK, further supporting our findings. The notable impact of our simplified adjacency kernel would likely be strengthened further were it supplemented with such direct measures of individual mobility patterns.

It is important to note that the highlighted impact of epidemiological factors, such as mobility patterns and contact networks, does not exclude the importance of health inequity in pandemic response. Health inequity is a complex phenomenon that extends beyond aggregated measures of deprivation and access-to-care, and further work is required to investigate its relation, both socially and quantitatively, to these underlying epidemiological factors. Our results should not be interpreted as ruling out the impact of health inequity in shaping epidemic trajectories; rather, that the aggregated measures considered do not directly improve model prediction of week-to-week transmission within a geography.

While real time modelling efforts are often limited by computational power and thus are limited in what level of spatial disaggregation can be allowed for, we have effectively demonstrated that mechanisms of case exportation are a worthwhile inclusion for improving model fit, and that the benefits of incorporating broader socio-demographic data are unlikely to be worth the time needed to gather and incorporate the relevant and up-to-date data.

Methods

Ethics statement

Ethics permission was sought for the study via Imperial College London’s (London, UK) standard ethical review processes and was approved by the College’s Research Governance and Integrity Team (ICREC reference 21IC6945). Patient consent was not required as the research team accessed fully anonymised data only, which were collected as part of routine public health surveillance activities by the UK Government.

Study population and data

Confirmed COVID-19 cases data were taken from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) national line list, collected by the Department of Health and Social Care as part of surveillance activities and shared with us. Only pillar 2 cases (swab testing of the wider population, not setting-specific) confirmed via PCR were used to account for changes in the availability of lateral flow devices (LFDs), as well as changes in test-seeking behaviour. Cases were then aggregated by week (beginning Monday) and LTLA. S-gene target failure (SGTF) data for each case was similarly obtained from the UKHSA line list to identify the proportion of COVID-19 variants each week. The cumulative number of first episodes by LTLA is obtained from the national data dashboard. Population data on ethnicity, age, population density, income, was taken from Office for National Statistics (ONS) reports. IMD data is taken from the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG) report on English Indices of Deprivation 2019 (IoD2019). Data on time spent at locations is taken from Google community mobility reports. Data on COVID-19 funding allocations was taken from the associated Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities reports.

In 2021 England was split into 309 LTLAs. Following the format used for the COVID-19 cases data release, we combine the LTLAs of Cornwall and Isles of Scilly; City of London and Hackney. The Isle of Wight LTLA is removed. Thus, this study reports on 306 English LTLAs total.

Detailed descriptions of all covariates are provided in section 1 of the S1 Appendix.

Epidemiological model and fitting

Using Bayesian evidence synthesis inference we fit a probabilistic model to data Yi,t, the number of weekly pillar 2 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases in LTLA i at week t, via a negative binomial distribution of the form Yi,t∼NegBinom(μi,t,ϕ)

for mean μi,t and overdispersion parameter ϕ. The mean takes the form μi,t=(λSi,t−1(Yi,t−1+ζi∑j∈ΩiYj,t−1)exp(xi,t−1β+zt−1+θi))

where Si,t−1 is an estimate of the proportion of the population of LTLA i that has no acquired immunity in week t−1, calculated as 1 –(total number of recorded “first episodes” in LTLA i by week t / LTLA i population), and λ is a scaling factor parameter, between 0 and 1, scaling the acquired-immunity lag term to account for the impact of under-reporting of first episodes, incomplete protection of acquired immunity, and other nationwide scaling effects. Ωi is the set of all LTLAs that share a boundary with LTLA i, and ζi is a model parameter between 0 and 1 denoting the proportion of cases in neighbouring LTLAs which will cause secondary cases in LTLA i. This represents a “nearest neighbours” spatial kernel formulation. xi,t−1 is a vector of the sixteen covariates considered in this study for LTLA i, at week t−1. β is the vector of coefficients capturing the relative impact of each covariate. A covariate is considered statistically significant if the 95% CI of its β coefficient posterior distribution does not span 0. zt−1 represents the (t−1)th step in a Gaussian random walk process, and θi is an LTLA-specific error-term.

Heuristically, the left-hand side of the expression represents the number of cases contributing to the next week’s number of cases, and the right-hand side may be considered an estimate of the time-varying reproduction number.

We model 95 weeks in total, from the week beginning May 10th 2020 to the week beginning February 27th 2022, as case testing rates become inconsistent outside of this window.

Analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.1. The model was run in Stan via the rstan [27] package. All associated code is available in our online repository (https://github.com/thomrawson/Rawson-spatial-covid). See section 5 of the S1 Appendix for full details of package versions.

Further methodological detail is provided in sections 2 and 3 of the S1 Appendix.

Sensitivity analyses

Model comparison is performed via the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd) score under a leave-future-out cross-validation process, detailed in section 4.2 of the S1 Appendix.

As a supplementary result we also test the impact of using different data streams. While SGTF is considered a highly accurate indicator for discerning between variants of concern (VOC) [28], for completeness the S1 Appendix also presents analyses where variant proportion is instead confirmed by whole genome sequencing (WGS). We also conduct a sensitivity analysis where case data is expanded to include both pillar 1 and pillar 2 cases and includes LFD cases. In both sensitivities, the results remain unchanged from the inclusion of these data.

Sensitivity analyses exploring acquired-immunity assumptions are presented in section 4.6 of the S1 Appendix.

Sensitivity analyses exploring differences in reporting by ethnicity and IMD are presented in section 4.7 of the S1 Appendix.

Other model formulations are included for comparison in section 4 of the S1 Appendix, including alternate spatial kernels and univariate models.

Dear Dr Rawson,

Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "The impact of health inequity on regional variation of COVID-19 infection in England" for consideration at PLOS Computational Biology.

As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. In light of the reviews (below this email), we would like to invite the resubmission of a significantly-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments.

I agree with the reviewers that this is a potentially important contribution that likely advances our understanding of health inequity on both how epidemics unfold and how it alters our perception of how they unfold. However, I also agree that a significant amount of work is needed to revise the manuscript. The authors should focus on strengthening their model comparisons, the potential bias associated with using detected cases (e.g., could the authors use the serosurveys run regularly in the England during the pandemic), and a detailed analysis of whether their information theoretic approaches to model selection are justified. The reviewers provide a detailed set of thoughtful comments, which the authors should pay careful attention to during their revision.

We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent to reviewers for further evaluation.

I agree with the reviewers that this is a potentially important contribution that likely advances our understanding of health inequity on both how epidemics unfold and how it alters our perception of how they unfold. However, I also agree that a significant amount of work is needed to revise the manuscript. The authors should focus on strengthening their model comparisons, the potential bias associated with using detected cases (e.g., could the authors use the serosurveys run regularly in the England during the pandemic), and a detailed analysis of whether their information theoretic approaches to model selection are justified.

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Authors:

Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.

Reviewer #1: In the proposed manuscript, the authors use the COVID-19 linelist data from the UK to model the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic between 2020 and 2022 at the LTLA level. They assess the importance of including LTLA-specific covariates in explaining the epidemic, concluding that ultimately, there was a limited role of factors linked to deprivation, ethnicity in driving the epidemic, while the spatial process was much more important. Overall, this represents an interesting analysis applied to very detailed series of datasets that capture the complex factors linked to SARS-CoV-2 spread. I have a few comments.

Ultimately this remains an ecological analysis comparing crude summary statistics from an area with incidence of detected cases from that area. In particular, deprivation is based on quantile – that is summarised for an area with over 100k people. There will certainly be heterogeneity within each LTLA that gets lost at this level of resolution. Community-based infection studies, such as the ONS and REACT studies that directly measured underlying levels of infection, provide a more direct link to individual infection risk. These community studies have tended to show a big difference in infection risk as a function of ethnicity, social deprivation, household size etc, especially early in the epidemic (see e.g., Ward et al., Nature Communications 2020). You can certainly get different conclusions when exploring the overall population level effect and individual infection risk – however, the way the paper is written, this nuance is lost. I would be careful to ensure that readers don’t conclude that there was equal infection risk by ethnicity, social deprivation, especially early in the epidemic, as this certainly wasn’t the case as shown by these direct measures. I would also include a discussion of the comparison between inferences from these community-based infection studies and this study.

The beta vector that links the covariates is static in time – however, some of these covariates could have changed importance over time. This should be discussed.

The susceptibility approach makes me nervous. The model assumes an immunizing infection and that the impact of vaccination is absorbed in the zi term. However, the zi term is the other side of the equation to susceptibility. We also know that reinfection was common, especially across variants. The authors demonstrate a big effect of variant proportion on case numbers – but this is difficult to interpret in the context of assumed sterilizing immunity between variants.

Is there an assumption of equal reporting by covariate? So if individuals of a lower deprivation systematically reported less, would that be captured in the LTLA specific term?

It is important to note that the majority of infections were probably missed by LTLA. This study focuses just on detected cases – however many infections were subclinical or not detected via PCR (and instead by at-home antigen testing) – especially towards the end of the time series. I suspect this all gets absorbed in the zi term, however, it would be good to at least mention the role of undetected infections.

Line 40. It would be good to get a sense of the size of LTLA (e.g., mean number of inhabitants). Is it reasonable to assume the population is homogeneous by the covariates of interest within an LTLA?

Line 67. The authors use an adjacent spatial model. I can see the reasons for doing this – however, is this the most relevant if we consider that e.g., parts of Manchester may be more connected to London than neighbouring LTLAs, and that this connectivity may change over the course of the pandemic?

Line 73. It is worth noting that real-time modelling may have different roles at different stages of an epidemic – especially one lasting several years. The presented results are for an overall average – however, early in the epidemic, when there are many more uncertainties, the model result may look different.

Figure 1B/1D – are these consistent with what was inferred from the community infection studies (ONS/REACT)? Is there a strong assumption about equal testing probability across the sub-populations and over time behind these plots?

Figure 3. I wonder again the importance of these terms at different stages of the epidemic. If the purpose of the paper is to explore a role for modelling in outbreak response, the authors may wish to present how these estimates change (if at all) at different stages of the pandemic – rather than an overall average based on data up to a time by when pretty much everyone in the country had been infected, often multiple times.

Figure 4. This is an interesting figure. I believe it is showing that the majority of the variance is captured by these ‘catch all’ temporal and spatial terms. Would it be possible to quantify how much of the overall variance in incidence is captured by each term? It may be that there is substantial heterogeneity at smaller spatial scales, time varying coefficients that are needed. Again – if the purpose is to understand the role of real time modelling – can these parameters be estimated reliably in an outbreak setting and what do they ultimately say?

Line 182- slightly pedantic point but diseases don’t spread - pathogens spread.

Line 183 – is Zt correlated with vaccine uptake (it seems this data is available)? – I assume Zt covers all manner of factors driving the epidemic.

Line 232 – I’d be very careful with this statement. It is important to note that the study is modelling detected cases, not infections. If there are systematic differences by ethnicity in reporting, systematic differences in symptom risk, this would impact these estimates. In the reference cited by the authors – the paper only uses outcome measures (mortality) without considering underlying differences in the risk of infection by ethnicity – which we know was significant in the early stages of the epidemic. For example, Ward et al., Nature communications 2021 used the REACT study results to show very limited difference in mortality risk once underlying differences in infection risk were accounted for.

Reviewer #2: (This review is also attached as a PDF which includes full formatting and math typesetting)

# Summary

The authors construct a probabilistic model that accounts for time-varying incidence across regions of England. Their model accounts for area-level risks as well as spatial connectivity between regions. They find that spatial connectivity or exportation was the primary factor driving spatial variation in risk. Shifts in dominant variant and other high-level factors (e.g. vaccine availability) were found to be key drivers of variation in incidence over time. A key goal of the study is to determine whether efforts at real-time or near real-time modeling could be improved by deeper integration of regional sociodemographic data into similar models.

Overall, this is a well thought-out, exhaustive, and technically sophisticated analysis. The authors should be commended for the thoughtfulness and thoroughness of their work. My comments and concerns outlined below should be interpreted in their intended spirit, which is to push the authors to sharpen the explanation of their results by making a more detailed comparison between their very flexible models including spatially structured and unstructured random effect terms and those relying more on locally-measured covariates. My primary concern relates to their reliance on an approach to model selection which may be inappropriate given violations of assumptions of exchangeability important to the validity of the LOO-PSIS framework, as well as conceptual difficulty in making use of their model comparison results to choose among the presented models. I will explain all of this in detail below.

# Major Comments

**Model Structure** The parameter $\\lambda$ is introduced as representing the degree of undercount in the number of first infections. I think this is likely too concrete an interpretation of this parameter, as it could also be adjusting the impact of prior infections on the number of subsequent infections in a given area due to uneven or incomplete protective immunity. In all likelihood, this parameter can be best understood as a kind 'fudge factor' that is scaling the immunological lag term represented by $S_{t-1}$ and includes some combination of the effect of prior infection on future immunity and the rate of undercounting. The authors should clarify the interpretation and role of this parameter in the model.

**Robustness of findings regarding local social factors.** One of the more unexpected findings of this study is that the LTLA-specific sociodemographic covariates did not have a strong association with area-level variability in risk. The authors conduct extensive sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of this finding to different model specifications. As evidenced by Table S4 in the supplement, the goodness of fit as measured by LOOIC is worst for models excluding the spatially-varying lag term ($\\zeta_i$). The differences are less dramatic for models including either a spatially varying or stationary spatial lag term ($\\zeta$).

While the authors helpfully include a sensitivity analysis showing the estimates of various social risk factors when controlled for individually vs. when all are simultaneously included in the model (Figure S60), this is only done in the presence of the spatially-varying importation term ($\\zeta_i$) and LTLA-specific random intercept ($\\theta_i$). Looking at Table S4, Model C, which includes spatially-varying $\\zeta_i$ but no area-specific $\\theta_i$ has a similar LOOIC value to Model A, which is the one presented in the most detail in the model. While the comparison in Figure S60 is helpful for illustrating that the correlations between these parameters do not impact their point estimates *in the presence of the spatial random effects*, the lack of detail on less-flexible models such as Model C or Models G & K makes it a bit difficult to fully assess their findings. Looking at the lower LOOIC values for models including the spatially unstructured random intercept $\\theta_i$ without covariates $x_i$ suggests that these flexible random effects are doing a quite good job of "mopping up" spatial variance and that the overall better LOOIC for the spatially flexible model may be an artifact of the choice to use the Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) along with leave-one-out cross-validation in which the information criterion is assessed one location/time combination at a time.

**Chosen information criterion may be inappropriate given model assumptions and inputs.** The authors state that they use the PSIS approach to computing LOO because the classic approach to LOO cross-validation is computationally expensive (i.e. leaving out one point at a time and re-running the model while computing the posterior predictive density for the held-out point). While this is true, I think it may be somewhat beside the point. The choice of pointwise LOO is unlikely to be appropriate in this setting for two reasons (for more detail, please see this document: https://mc-stan.org/loo/articles/online-only/faq.html#spatial) . First, the use of a spatial lag on the *observed* values of $y_i$ rather than the predicted latent values, as is present in the current model, violates the assumption of conditional independence of the observations $y_i$ necessary for LOO-based (with or without PSIS) to be valid in this setting. For spatial and time-series models (or those which are both as in this one), LOO is valid when the posterior predictive density is conditional on some latent value $f_i$ in which the likelihood $Pr(y_i |f_i, \\phi )$ is a function of the latent values (i.e. the $\\mu_i$ in the current model) and parameters related to the observation process ($\\phi$).

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Authors:

Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.

Reviewer #1: The authors have done an excellent job of responding to my concerns. I have no further comments.

Reviewer #3: Reviewer 1 brought up several crucial points, many of which resonated with my own observations. I was impressed to see the revisions and the authors' thoroughness in conducting additional sensitivity analyses in great detail.

I have a couple of minor comments, along with one concern regarding the clarity of the results' interpretation (point 5):

1. How is statistical significance of variables defined?

2. Administrative regions or areas for LTLAs- needs consistency in the manuscript, including the title. https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/administrativegeography/england

3. The authors mention mechanistic impact in the abstract. How is this defined? I didn’t see it anywhere in the main manuscript or the supplementary methods.

4. In addition to Reviewer 1’s comment and the authors’ response to it “Line 67. The authors use an adjacent spatial model. I can see the reasons for doing this – however, is this the most relevant if we consider that e.g., parts of Manchester may be more connected to London than neighbouring LTLAs, and that this connectivity may change over the course of the pandemic?” I was hoping that the authors would consider mobility patterns to quantify connectivity, rather than Euclidean distances and a gravity model. I think it would be a stronger predictor if such a variable were to be used in real time. Or making a note of this in the discussion.

5. The last sentence in the abstract says ”While these results confirm the impact of some, but not all, measures of regional inequity in England, our work corroborates the finding that observed differences in regional disease transmission during the pandemic were predominantly driven by underlying epidemiological factors rather than the demography and health inequity between regions.” I think it is important to think about why the important drivers i.e. epidemiological parameters, mobility patterns could be different between areas. I would argue that inequity is a complex phenomenon (both socially and as a quantitative measure) and is probably a crucial underlying cause of the differences in epidemiological factors. This phrasing makes me nervous about its interpretation by readers. I would request the authors to be more specific in their concluding statement in the abstract which can be easily misinterpreted. It would be more appropriate and transparent to say that the static, aggregated sociodemographic variables don’t add much value in prediction of transmission or effective reproduction number. And this work would motivate the field to move forward in a direction where we try to understand the underlying causes and drivers of the epidemiological factors which are in turn the drivers of transmission. But from the point of view of prediction in real time and improving model fit (as described in the last section of the discussion), I agree that these poorly collected, outdated and often incomplete measures of inequity don’t add much value, as they currently stand. And I would be more confident with a similar careful phrasing in the abstract.

6. Is it possible that the random walk term captures many of the factors that constitute inequity and as expected is one of the greatest contributors to Reff?

7. The authors have made the distinction between detected cases and infections and provided sensitivity analysis for a few different reporting scenarios. Reporting (for lateral flow tests: sensitivity analysis 4.4 was done to include data from UK COVID-19 data dashboard) and test seeking behaviour (PCR which is the primary data used) likely changed over time and by the different groups. In addition to the analyses, it would be good make it clear that the Pillar 2 PCR dataset is likely a combination of the true (primarily symptomatic) cases, test seeking behaviour and changes in intended use of the tests (for symptomatic testing, confirmatory tests)– around line 78 or 287.
