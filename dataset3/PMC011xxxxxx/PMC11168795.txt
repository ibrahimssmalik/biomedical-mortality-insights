==== Body
pmcEsophageal wall abscesses (EWAs) are rare lesions often linked to post-traumatic or inflammatory causes. To date, no authors have described their association with a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). While typically managed surgically owing to expertise constraints, this approach carries invasive risks, including mediastinitis. Interventional endoscopy offers a less invasive alternative, aiding both comprehensive treatment and etiologic diagnostic evaluation. Here, we report a case of recurrent EWA post-surgical debridement, treated endoscopically via wall incision, purulent content aspiration, and complete abscess fenestration into the esophageal cavity. Surprisingly, endoscopy revealed concomitant EoE.

A 24-year-old man presented with septic shock from a recurrent EWA, 11 cm in length, which had undergone previous surgical management. Endoscopic intervention was pursued this time.

Endoscopic ultrasound revealed a confined submucosal collection. Mucosal bulging and a small orifice, possibly from prior trauma or fistulization, were noted ( Video 1 ). A 3-cm esophageal wall incision allowed access to the abscessed cavity for drainage and irrigation ( Fig. 1 ), followed by closure with clips and insertion of a plastic stent for guided healing.

Endoscopic management of recurrent esophageal wall abscess revealing concomitant eosinophilic esophagitis.

Video 1

Fig. 1 An esophageal incision measuring 3 cm was made to access the abscessed cavity for drainage.

Epithelialization of the treated cavity was observed 3 weeks later. It was separated from the esophageal lumen by a 10-cm long mucosal and fibrous septum ( Fig. 2 ), which was fully sectioned without incident. Endoscopic follow-up at 4 months revealed satisfactory healing, albeit with typical signs of EoE ( Fig. 3 ), with an EREFS (edema, rings, exudate, furrows, stricture) 1 score of 5.

Fig. 2 A follow-up at 3 weeks demonstrated a mucosal septum separating the treated cavity from the esophageal lumen.

Fig. 3 At 4 months, the follow-up revealed healing of the treated section and typical signs of eosinophilic esophagitis.

This case demonstrates that EWAs can be effectively and comprehensively treated in a minimally invasive manner through endoscopy.
