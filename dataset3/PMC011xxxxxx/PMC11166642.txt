pmcCorrection to: Scientific Reports 10.1038/s41598-024-62335-1, published online 23 May 2024

The original version of this Article contained an error in Reference 46, which was incorrectly given as:

Schreiber, C., Remacle, A., Chantraine, F., Kolanowski, E. & Moissenet, F. Influence of a rhythmic auditory stimulation on asymptomatic gait. Gait Posture 50, 17–22 (2016).

The correct reference is listed below:

Schreiber, C. et al. Influence of walking velocity on strategies of head stabilisation. Mov. Sport Sci. Sci. Motric., 93, 57–61 (2016).

The original Article has been corrected.
