Background

Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) account for 10.7% of all tendon and ligament injuries and causes lasting muscular deficits and have a profound impact on patients’ quality of life. The incidence, characteristics and management of ATR in the United Kingdom (UK) is poorly understood. This investigation aims to understand the incidence of ATR in the UK.

Methods

Prospective data collection of ATR incidence from a United Kingdom Emergency department. Retrospective review of management protocols and immobilisation duration from electronic medical records.

Results

ATR incidence is 8 per 100,000 people per annum. Participants were predominately male (79.2%) and primarily reported a sporting mechanism of injury (65.2%). Mean immobilisation duration was 63.1 days. 97.1% were non-surgically managed post ATR. 46.2% of participants had experienced a previous ATR or Achilles tendinopathy prior to their current ATR.

Conclusion

The incidence of ATR found was 8. cases per 100,000 people per annum. Most ATR were managed non-surgically in this cohort. The majority of ruptures occurred during sporting activity. Almost one quarter (23.3%) of individuals report Achilles pain prior to ATR.

==== Body
pmcBackground

The Achilles tendon (AT) is the largest and strongest tendon in the body [1]. Through elastic energy storage, the AT improves movement efficiency, transmitting forces of 2.7–3.95 times body weight during walking and 4.15 to 7.71 when running [2]. Achilles tendon ruptures (ATR) can occur when tendon strain exceeds maximum tendon capacity. Common mechanisms for ATR include sudden or violent dorsiflexion of the ankle or a sporting acceleration-deceleration mechanism [3]. ATR are the most common tendon ruptures accounting for 10.7% of all tendon and ligament injuries [4]. Incidence rates range is 2.5–47 per 100,000 person-years in north America and Europe [5–10]. ATR incidence is rising, with the most significant increase between the ages of 40–59 [6, 7]. Significant variation in incidence occurs due to the population sampled (male/female), sample age, geographic range (local/regional/national), sampling setting (emergency department/medical database review) or time of sampling (season). UK ATR incidence increased from 6–13 per 100,00 person years from 1995 to 2019 [11, 12]. However, this data represents ATR incidence in Scotland and a single NHS trust in England. Further incidence data is required to improve understanding of ATR incidence in England.

Risk factors for ATR can be categorised as intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic factors include AT properties, age, sex, genetics and systemic comorbidities. Extrinsic factors include sporting activity, exposure to AT loading and medications [13, 14]. Previous studies have proposed that the rising incidence of ATR is associated with the increasing use of medications associated with ATR in an active, aging population [15]. However, the quality of evidence remains low and further research is required to understand the demographics of the ATR population in the UK.

Surgical and non-surgical management approaches following ATR have been compared extensively. In the UK, non-surgical approaches represent standard practice due to comparable rates of re-rupture with accelerated functional rehabilitation protocols and lower associated complications [16–20]. Recent randomised controlled trials have reported an increased re-rupture risk following non-surgical management [21]. However, in this trial, non-surgical management did not represent the typical accelerated functional rehabilitation non-surgical management protocols that have been developed in the UK, such as the Leicester Achilles Management Protocol (LAMP) and Swansea Morriston Achilles Rupture Treatment (SMART) protocol [22, 23]. AT re-ruptures are reported between 0.9–2% when adopting these non-surgical protocols. However, due to significant loss to follow up, the studies investigating these protocols may under-represent non-surgical re-rupture rates and should be interpreted with caution.

This investigation aims to 1) identify the incidence of ATR in the UK 2) identify the characteristics of the ATR population 3) Identify rates of surgical and non-surgical management including duration of boot immobilisation.

Methods

Trial design

Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of individuals presenting to the emergency department (ED) diagnosed with ATR. Data was collected at a National Health Service (NHS) Trust from March 2015 to June 2021.

Participants

All individuals with clinically confirmed ATR documented in ED medical notes were included in the analysis. Comorbidity and medication data was extracted from ED medical notes. In addition to routine comorbidity data collection, participants were asked if they had experienced previous Achilles injury or pain. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively to determine management protocols (surgical/non-surgical) and controlled mobilisation (VACOped™ boot) (Fig 1) duration. The NHS trust studied routinely uses the Leicester Achilles Management Protocol (LAMP) [22] consisting of 8 weeks-controlled mobilisation.

10.1371/journal.pone.0304197.g001 Fig 1 Vacoped controlled mobilisation boot.

Data analysis

Data was analysed using SPSS (V28.0, IBM, New York, USA). Data distribution was assessed for normality and reported as means/ median with standard deviation (SD)/ interquartile range (IQR).

Annual incidence data was calculated using complete years. Population data was taken from the County Council demography report [24]. Comorbidity/ medication data used for comparison was taken from NHS or musculoskeletal health reports [25–27].

The relationship between mechanism of injury, demographics, comorbidities and medications are explored. The management approach (surgical/non-surgical) was analysed in relation to participant demographics, comorbidities and duration to present to ED. Groups were compared using an independent t-test or non-parametric equivalent.

Results

There were 361 participants diagnosed with ATR in ED and included in analysis. Participant’s median (IQR) age was 45 (19) years and were predominantly male (79.2%). Comorbidity and medication data was available for 328 and 316 participants. Comorbidities and medications documented on ED assessment and the comparison to local prevalence are displayed in Tables 1 and 2. Concurrent with routine data collection, pre-rupture Achilles pain/ injury data was collected from 117/361 participants. Achilles pain/ injury prior to ATR was reported by 46.2% (n = 54/117) of participants (Table 3). In participants with Achilles pain/ injury, 61.1% (n = 33/54) reported their complaint bilaterally or on the side of current ATR. There was no significant difference in the number of comorbidities between participants who reported previous AT pain or rupture and participants with no prior symptoms.

The primary mechanism of injury was sporting activities (65.2%). Participants with a sporting mechanism of injury had a mean (SD) age of 41.0 (12.2) years in comparison to 55.4 (13.4) in participants with a non-sporting mechanism of injury (p = 0.55). Participants with a sporting mechanism of injury had statistically significantly fewer comorbidities (0.9 (1.3) vs 1.7 (1.8), p = <0.001) and medications (0.7 vs 1.7, p = <0.001) than those with a non-sporting mechanism of injury.

The median (IQR) time to present to ED following injury was 0 days (1). Nearly all (97.1%) of the participants were non-surgically managed post ATR. There were no significant differences in age or number of comorbidities between surgical and non-surgical groups. The surgical group had a greater mean (days) duration between initial injury and presenting to ED (2.6 (4.9) vs 1.9 (4.8), p = 0.36). The mean (SD) duration wearing the immobilisation boot was 63.1(10.8) days.

The ATR per month incidence rate for each year (March 2016-June 2021) is provided in Fig 2 for all participants.

10.1371/journal.pone.0304197.g002 Fig 2 Achilles tendon rupture incidence per month.

Annual ATR incidence was calculated for complete years (2016–2020, n = 277). The mean (SD) annual incidence was 56 (6) ATR per year. An incidence rate of 8 per 100,000 people per annum.

The reference line shows the line of best fit over the last 6 years of ATR data.

Discussion

The incidence of ATR presenting to ED was 8 per 100,000 people per annum. Consistent with previous UK ATR data, an increasing incidence of ATR was identified [11]. International ATR incidence rates are varied, these findings report a higher incidence than the United States, 3.2 per 100,000 person years [7] but lower than other nations (29.5–32.3 per 100,000 person years) [5, 6]. Incidence reports in the United States represent data from an electronic database review [7]. As all medical centres were not included, this review is unlikely to capture all ATR and is expected to under-represent the true incidence rate in the United States.

The ATR population is predominantly male, and injuries most commonly occur during sporting activities. This is consistent with current incidence studies [5–7]. However, males represented a greater proportion of participants and ATR were more frequently associated with non-sporting mechanisms than previously observed [7, 28].

Medications and comorbidities may contribute to ATR aetiology [13, 14]. The overall distribution of comorbidities and medications were similar to the general population. Fluroquinolones were only reported in two cases despite the known association with ATR [29]. The medication dose and interaction between concomitant medications was not investigated and may have a significant impact on ATR risk. The lack of comorbidities and medications found may be due to ATR primarily occurring in the sporting population who present with less comorbid health conditions. In this study, the non-sporting population are older and have greater number of comorbidities and medications. Identifying an older subgroup who present with greater number of comorbidities may provide an insight into tailoring future immobilisation and rehabilitation protocols.

Previous ATR or pain was reported in nearly half of participants. This is the first UK data on Achilles symptoms prior to rupture. As data collection was additional to usual care the sample was limited and findings should be interpreted with caution. In comparison, previous studies found one third of participants experience Achilles symptoms prior to ATR [30]. Achilles tendinopathy is a risk factor for ATR with 4% of individuals with Achilles tendinopathy experiencing ATR [14, 30]. It is unknown if current interventions for AT pathologies reduce the risk of ATR as the ability to alter tendon structure is debated [31].

The UK management of ATR is predominantly non-surgical. This contrasts with surgical management rates seen internationally [5, 6]. The immobilisation duration is consistent with published protocols in this region of the UK [22]. There is a disparity with other regions in the UK which adopt longer immobilisation periods [23].

Study limitations

This study was limited to a single ED site, it is expected that primary care sites across the region that were not included in this analysis will manage acute ATR. Therefore, the incidence reported is conservative and ATR presenting to secondary care is anticipated to be higher. Future research needs to include larger numbers of primary care sites across the UK to determine the true incidence rate and management of ATR. Understanding current ATR incidence and management is essential for the development of future care in this population.

Conclusion

The incidence rate of ATR in England is higher than previously reported elsewhere in the UK. There is a continuing trend towards increasing ATR incidence each year. Non-sporting mechanisms of injury are more common than previously reported and occur in an older population with greater number of comorbidities and medications.

Reviewer #1: Dear Authors,

the aim of your manuscript is to report epidemiological data about Achilles tendon ruptures in the UK.

The article is overall well-written and well-organized.

I have some suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript:

1) The Title may be misleading: I would specifically report that this is an epidemiological study.

2) Introduction is short but fine. You may add something more on how an ATR can occur, focusing on what kind of specific movements (eg. accelerating after landing with violent ankle dorsiflexion) and comorbidities/drugs (eg. diabetes, fluoroquinolones, etc). This could be helpful for a better uderstantind of your results.

3) Methods: it should be reported "who made what".

4) Methods: a Figure of the VACOped boot and a biref description could be useful.

5) Results: Figure 1 is missing.

6) Discussion: I suggest to give short interpretation of your results, linking them to some specific observed conditions or drugs (eg. diabetes, higher statins consumption, sterioids, antibiotics, etc).

7) Please consider to cite the following articles:

Reviewer #2: General comments

Important study of a topic with increasing interest. Well written manuscript. There are some issues that need to be addressed as explained below. The discrepancy of the incidence data between this study and the incidences reported in Finland and Denmark is a concern. The authors briefly discuss this in “Limitations”. Overall, only minor revision seems necessary before publication.

Specific comments

Abstract

Well written. But why do you not state “symptomatic” instead of “asymptomatic” in the last sentence in the conclusion? Most ATR occur in individuals with no prior pain before rupture…

Background

Line 7-8: Regarding incidences in north America and Europe. The study by Lemme et al (ref. 6) used data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database which collects data from approximately 100 representative US hospitals with at least 6 beds and with a 24-hours emergency department services. Achilles tendon ruptures treated outside these kinds of hospitals (non-operatively or surgically) will not be registered in the database. Therefore, the data from the Lemme study is most probably not representative for the true incidence of acute Achilles tendon rupture in the US. The incidence is most probably higher. The observed increase in incidence, however, is probably realistic. Suggest to either comment on this or remove the reference and the incidence numbers referred to in the text.

Or consider using the article from Cretnik instead of Lemme and narrow the incidence interval according to the incidence in the remaining publications (Čretnik A, Košir R. Incidence of Achilles tendon rupture: 25-year regional analysis with a focus on bilateral ruptures. J Int Med Res. 2023 Nov;51(11):3000605231205179. doi: 10.1177/03000605231205179. PMID: 37976267; PMCID: PMC10657533.)

The authors might also consider using this reference: Ganestam A, Kallemose T, Troelsen A, Barfod KW. Increasing incidence of acute Achilles tendon rupture and a noticeable decline in surgical treatment from 1994 to 2013. A nationwide registry study of 33,160 patients. Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc. 2016 Dec;24(12):3730-3737. doi: 10.1007/s00167-015-3544-5. Epub 2015 Feb 20. PMID: 25697284.

Line 18-21: The authors claim there is similar risk of re-rupture comparing surgical and non-surgical treatment. This is most probably an assumption based on RCTs wich are under-powered (ref. 10-13). The largest RCT performed on treatment results following ATR clearly finds a significant higher incidence of re-rupture after non-operative treatment (Myhrvold SB, Brouwer EF, Andresen TKM, Rydevik K, Amundsen M, Grün W, Butt F, Valberg M, Ulstein S, Hoelsbrekken SE. Nonoperative or Surgical Treatment of Acute Achilles' Tendon Rupture. N Engl J Med. 2022 Apr 14;386(15):1409-1420. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2108447. PMID: 35417636.)

I would also suggest the authors to read the editorial of Barfod and Hölmich stating that surgery protects from re-rupture (Barfod KW, Hölmich P. Acute Achilles' Tendon Rupture - Surgery or No Surgery. N Engl J Med. 2022 Apr 14;386(15):1465-1466. doi: 10.1056/NEJMe2202696. PMID: 35417642.)

Please change this section according to available high-quality publications and consider adding these publications to the reference list.

METHODS

Trial Design

OK.

RESULTS

Tables 1, 2 and 3:

Please remove the “%” from the parentheses in the second column.

DISCUSSION

Line 129: Please replace “prevalence of ATR” with “incidence of ATR”.

Line 130: Again (as in line 7-8): The low incidence data from US is not trustworthy for the true incidence of ATR. Suggest to either comment on this or rephrase.

Study Limitations:

Well written. The true incidence of ATR in the UK is most probably higher that the incidence reported here. The authors are obviously aware of that.

Referenses:

I have concerns of two of the references:

Firstly ref. 6 (Lemme et al). See my explanation above under Background.

Secondly ref. 15 (Hutchison). This is a study which should be interpreted with a high degree of caution. I suggest the authors to read the answer to the Editor in tbe NEJM from 2022 (Myhrvold SB, Ulstein S, Hoelsbrekken SE. Nonoperative or Surgical Treatment of Acute Achilles' Tendon Rupture. Reply. N Engl J Med. 2022 Jul 7;387(1):91. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc2206333. PMID: 35793214.) Please take this into consideration and adapt this knowledge of potential loss to follow-up in that study when referring to this throughout the manuscript. Or consider removing the reference.

Good luck with the revision!

Incidence, demographics, characteristics and management of acute Achilles tendon rupture: an epidemiological study

Concerns

It seems like the authors have addressed most of the concerns and suggestions from the reviewers. The revision of the manuscript is an improvement. However, I would like to highlight three minor and one major concern of the revised manuscript:

1) Minor concern: The authors found that the incidence is 8 ATR per 100.000 people/year. This is stated both in the results and conclusion sections in the abstract and the manuscript. At the same time the authors discuss the possibility of this number to be an underestimation of the true incidence. I would suggest rephrasing these sentences and just state that you found an incidence of 8 ATR / 100.000 / year, not that it is.

2) Minor concern: Line 10-11: The authors claim that the incidence rates range “from 2.5-32.2”.... Suggest to instead use “range from NN to NN” or “the incidence range is NN-NN”. In addition, the authors have not considered the incidence data from Sweden published by Huttunen et al in 2014. They found an incidence of almost 47 ATR / 100000 / year in 2012. Please include this reference and adjust the incidence range accordingly. (Huttunen TT, Kannus P, Rolf C, Felländer-Tsai L, Mattila VM. Acute achilles tendon ruptures: incidence of injury and surgery in Sweden between 2001 and 2012. Am J Sports Med. 2014 Oct;42(10):2419-23. doi: 10.1177/0363546514540599. Epub 2014 Jul 23. PMID: 25056989.)

3) Minor concern: From author guidelines: “References are listed at the end of the manuscript and numbered in the order that they appear in the text.” Please comply with the author guidelines.

4) Major concern: Lines 28-37: Although most ATRs can be managed safely without surgery if treatment with equinus positioning of the ankle is initiated early, the authors still claim that the re-rupture rates after surgical and non-operative treatment are similar. The authors have performed some changes to this section and implemented reference to the RCT published in NEJM in 2022 (ref. 28). They state, however, that the non-surgical management did not represent protocols that have been developed in the UK such as the LAMP and SMART protocol. This is a major concern regarding bias. The fact that other protocols are developed outside the UK is scientifically irrelevant. The major adverse event with the highest negative impact on ATRS and return to sports has shown to be re-rupture (Metz R, van der Heijden GJ, Verleisdonk EJ, Kolfschoten N, Verhofstad MH, van der Werken C. Effect of complications after minimally invasive surgical repair of acute achilles tendon ruptures: report on 211 cases. Am J Sports Med. 2011 Apr;39(4):820-4. doi: 10.1177/0363546510392012. Epub 2011 Feb 2. PMID: 21289275.) Therefore, acknowledging high quality studies assessing re-rupture rates after Achilles tondon ruptures is essential in developing recommendations and patient decision aids in the shared decision-making process of treatment selection.

In the Supplementary Appendix to the NEJM-RCT (ref. 28), Supplemental Appendices S2.2: INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED TO PHYSIOTHERAPISTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REHABILITATION OF STUDY PATIENTS. These instructions, which are outlined over three pages, clearly describe the rehabilitation program from injury to 36 weeks post-injury, in detail. The boot was removed 8 weeks after initiation of treatment. The SMART protocol is comparable to the one used in the NEJM-RCT with the exception that the boot is kept for at least 10 weeks in the SMART protocol. This might explain some (but not all) of the re-ruptures in the non-operative group in the NEJM-RCT as half of the re-ruptures in this trial occurred within 10 weeks post-injury. However, all 13 re-ruptures occurred outside a rehabilitation setting and all of them were related to unwanted incidences or poor compliance with excessive loading of the injured foot beyond recommended restrictions, and hence were not the result of inferiority of the post-boot protocol per se.

In the LAMP protocol the initial equinus position is held for 4 weeks and the boot removed at 8 weeks. In the publication of Aujla et al from 2019 almost half of the patients are lost to follow-up and the 9 re-ruptures constitute almost 4% of the 234 patients that were not lost to follow-up (Aujla RS, Patel S, Jones A, Bhatia M. Non-operative functional treatment for acute Achilles tendon ruptures: The Leicester Achilles Management Protocol (LAMP). Injury. 2019 Apr;50(4):995-999. doi: 10.1016/j.injury.2019.03.007. Epub 2019 Mar 11. PMID: 30898390.). Consequently, convincing evidence that the LAMP protocol is superior to other accelerated functional rehabilitation protocols does not exist.

In the Lancet UKSTAR trial from 2020 including 540 adults receiving non-operative treatment with either cast-immobilization or early weight-bearing in a functional brace, no difference in re-rupture rate was observed, implying that early weight bearing and the use of a functional brace do not reduce the risk of re-rupture (Costa ML, Achten J, Marian IR, Dutton SJ, Lamb SE, Ollivere B, Maredza M, Petrou S, Kearney RS; UKSTAR trial collaborators. Plaster cast versus functional brace for non-surgical treatment of Achilles tendon rupture (UKSTAR): a multicentre randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation. Lancet. 2020 Feb 8;395(10222):441-448. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32942-3. PMID: 32035553; PMCID: PMC7016510.).

Whether the selection of patients to surgical or non-operative treatment using

ultrasound as in the SMART protocol is associated with lower re-rupture rates is poorly documented. An ongoing RCT will hopefully add new knowledge to the usefulness of using ultrasound as a selection tool (Hansen MS, Vestermark MT, Hölmich P, Kristensen MT, Barfod KW. Individualized treatment for acute Achilles tendon rupture based on the Copenhagen Achilles Rupture Treatment Algorithm (CARTA): a study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Trials. 2020 May 12;21(1):399. doi: 10.1186/s13063-020-04332-z. PMID: 32398120; PMCID: PMC7218535.)

Two satellite trials using the CARTA protocol have not shown any superiority of the treatment results using ultrasound as a treatment selection tool (Barfod KW, Overgård AB, Hansen MS, Haddouchi IE, Toft M, Hölmich P. Effect of the Copenhagen Achilles Rupture Treatment Algorithm (CARTA) on Calf Muscle Volume and Tendon Elongation After Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture: A Predefined Secondary Analysis of the First 60 Patients in a Randomized Controlled Trial. Orthop J Sports Med. 2023 Nov 21;11(11):23259671231211282. doi: 10.1177/23259671231211282. PMID: 38021304; PMCID: PMC10664448.) and (Hansen MS, Bencke J, Kristensen MT, Kallemose T, Hölmich P, Barfod KW. Achilles tendon gait dynamics after rupture: A three-armed randomized controlled trial comparing an individualized treatment algorithm vs. operative or non-operative treatment. Foot Ankle Surg. 2023 Feb;29(2):143-150. doi: 10.1016/j.fas.2022.12.006. Epub 2022 Dec 13. PMID: 36528540.). The CARTA protocol uses cast for 3 weeks followed by a functional brace for 6 weeks.

Sample size matters when comparing re-rupture rates between non-operative and surgical treatment of ATR because the re-rupture rates are generally low. The meta-analysis by Ochen et al pooled data from 10 RCTs and 19 observational studies and yielded similar results as in the NEJM-RCT (Ochen Y, Beks RB, van Heijl M, Hietbrink F, Leenen LPH, van der Velde D, Heng M, van der Meijden O, Groenwold RHH, Houwert RM. Operative treatment versus nonoperative treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures: systematic review and meta-analysis. BMJ. 2019 Jan 7;364:k5120. doi: 10.1136/bmj.k5120. PMID: 30617123; PMCID: PMC6322065.)

In conclusion, the length of immobilization in an equinus position as well as time from injury to removal of the boot might be factors affecting the risk of re-rupture and should be investigated further. However, claiming that surgery does not protect against re-rupture does no longer have convincing support in the literature (Barfod KW, Hölmich P. Acute Achilles' Tendon Rupture - Surgery or No Surgery. N Engl J Med. 2022 Apr 14;386(15):1465-1466. doi: 10.1056/NEJMe2202696. PMID: 35417642.).

I will strongly suggest that the authors revise the section in lines 28-37 to adhere to updated strong evidence of increased risk of re-rupture after non-operative treatment.

Please also consider including all the references mentioned above in the reference list.
