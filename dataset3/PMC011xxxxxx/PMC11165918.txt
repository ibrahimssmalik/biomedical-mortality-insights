Abstract

Introduction. The term ‘diagnostic stewardship’ is relatively new, with a recent surge in its use within the literature. Despite its increasing popularity, a precise definition remains elusive. Various attempts have been made to define it, with some viewing it as an integral part of antimicrobial stewardship. The World Health Organization offers a broad definition, emphasizing the importance of timely, accurate diagnostics. However, inconsistencies in the use of this term still persist, necessitating further clarification.

Gap Statement. There are currently inconsistencies in the definition of diagnostic stewardship used within the academic literature.

Aim. This scoping review aims to categorize the use of diagnostic stewardship approaches and define this approach by identifying common characteristics and factors of its use within the literature.

Methodology. This scoping review undertook a multi-database search from date of inception until October 2022. Any observational or experimental study where the authors define the intervention to be diagnostic stewardship from any clinical area was included. Screening of all papers was undertaken by a single reviewer with 10% verification by a second reviewer. Data extraction was undertaken by a single reviewer using a pre-piloted form. Given the wide variation in study design and intervention outcomes, a narrative synthesis approach was applied. Studies were clustered around common diagnostic stewardship interventions where appropriate.

Results. After duplicate removal, a total of 1310 citations were identified, of which, after full-paper screening, 105 studies were included in this scoping review. The classification of an intervention as taking a diagnostic stewardship approach is a relatively recent development, with the first publication in this field dating back to 2017. The majority of research in this area has been conducted within the USA, with very few studies undertaken outside this region. Visual inspection of the citation map reveals that the current evidence base is interconnected, with frequent references to each other’s work. The interventions commonly adopt a restrictive approach, utilizing hard and soft stops within the pre-analytical phase to restrict access to testing. Upon closer examination of the outcomes, it becomes evident that there is a predominant focus on reducing the number of tests rather than enhancing the current test protocol. This is further reflected in the limited number of studies that report on test performance (including protocol improvements, specificity and sensitivity).

Conclusion. Diagnostic stewardship seems to have deviated from its intended course, morphing into a rather rudimentary instrument wielded not to enhance but to constrict the scope of testing. Despite the World Health Organization’s advocacy for an ideology that promotes a more comprehensive approach to quality improvement, it may be more appropriate to consider alternative regional narratives when categorizing these types of quality improvement interventions.

Introduction

The growing challenges facing healthcare systems appear unrelenting [12]. Ageing populations, increase in chronic conditions, staffing shortages and the effects of the era of living with COVID-19 place health services under pressure [35]. With demand for healthcare anticipated to rise globally during the ensuing decade, there is an increasing emphasis on using constrained resources appropriately [67]. Given that diagnostic services are a fundamental part of care pathways, they are not immune to these pressures, and it is important that they operate effectively and efficiently [38 9]. Although a relatively new term [10], diagnostic stewardship has received increased attention during the last 10 years as concern has grown around the appropriate use of resources to deliver high-quality effective healthcare [9]. Despite the increased use of the term, its precise definition is yet to be established, which is important to ensure appropriate use of the strategy in managing care [11].

‘Antimicrobial stewardship’ is defined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as ‘an organisational or healthcare-system-wide approach to promoting and monitoring judicious use of antimicrobials to preserve their future effectiveness’ [12]. This approach is designed to prevent inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, which can cause direct patient harm in the form of adverse effects including healthcare-associated infections, and the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [13]. The essence of antimicrobial stewardship programmes is to ensure that the right patient receives the right antimicrobial, at the right time, via the right route, at the right dose and for the right duration [14]. The logical extension should suggest that ‘diagnostic stewardship’ is performing the right test, on the right patient, at the right time. Editorials and reviews have attempted to define the term [9,1517], and some have detailed the various stages where interventions may be applied in the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical phases [9]. However, publications, including systematic reviews [18], retrospective studies [1920] and multi-centre validation of machine learning tools [21], have used the term without defining it. One collaborative study regarding paediatric blood cultures (BCs) defined diagnostic stewardship as “optimising the use of diagnostic tests to improve treatment decisions” [22]. Conversely, members of two subgroups of the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases have expressed concerns about the use of the term [11]. Diagnostic stewardship should not be a standalone practice but rather an integral part of antimicrobial stewardship [11]. ‘Diagnostic test appropriateness’ was proposed as an alternative term to engage with non-diagnostic specialists, although the definition of the former term has not yet been formalized [11].

As part of its Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined diagnostic stewardship as ‘coordinated guidance and interventions to improve appropriate use of microbiological diagnostics to guide therapeutic decisions . It should promote appropriate, timely diagnostic testing, including specimen collection, and pathogen identification and accurate, timely reporting of results to guide patient treatment’ [23]. In this context, GLASS aims to deliver ‘patient management guided by timely microbiological data to deliver safer and more effective and efficient patient care’, and ‘accurate and representative AMR surveillance data to inform treatment guidelines, and AMR control strategies’ [23]. This WHO initiative is targeted to improve access to standardized diagnostics at AMR surveillance sites, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Thus, it is evident that there are notable inconsistencies regarding the use of diagnostic stewardship as a term, and further clarification of the nomenclature is required. We endeavour to undertake this task by categorizing the present application of the term within the current published literature.

Aims

The primary aim of this scoping review is to categorize the use of diagnostic stewardship interventions within the current literature. The secondary aims are to define diagnostic stewardship by identifying common characteristics and factors of its use within the literature.

Methods

Prior to commencement, this scoping review was pre-registered on the open science framework registry (see https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WYEKB). The scoping review methodology followed the guidance provided by Peters et al. (2015) and Levac et al. (2010)] [2425].

Search

The following electronic bibliographic databases were searched for studies where an intervention was defined as diagnostic stewardship: MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/advanced/), Embase (Ovid), The Cochrane Library (all databases via Wiley), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov registry and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from date of inception to October 2022 (see supplement file 1, available in the online version of this article for MEDLINE search strategy example). No language or other limits were applied to the searches. Furthermore, an additional search was conducted using Google Scholar via Harzing’s Publish or Perish (Windows GUI Edition 8.2.3944.8118) leading to the retrieval of a software restricted maximum of 1000 results. The identification of duplicate entries was initially carried out with EndNote and subsequently cross-checked with Rayyan, with verification performed by a single reviewer (J.H.).

Study selection

Any type of observational or experimental study (including conference abstracts) where the author explicitly defined the intervention as ‘diagnostic stewardship’ from any clinical area (primary, secondary and tertiary care settings) was included. As the aim was to include as many studies as possible, there was no specified outcome set.

Abstract and title screening was carried out by a single reviewer using Rayyan. This selection process was piloted with 10% of retrieved abstracts and titles being screened by a second reviewer independently and resolved before undertaking the remaining screening [26]. A Kappa Score was calculated for this piloted screening process, and substantial agreement (0.61–0.80) was required before continuation. If this could not be achieved, increments of 10 % were screened until substantial agreement could be achieved. Full-paper screening used the same 10 % verification process, and reasons for exclusion were recorded and reported during full-paper screening.

Data extraction (selection and coding)

Data extraction was undertaken by a single reviewer using a pre-piloted form. The data items extracted included the country of study, town/city, study type, clinical setting, single or multi-centre, population, sample size, diagnostic focus, specimen type, test type, pathology discipline and outcomes.

Strategy for data synthesis

Due to the expected wide variation in study design, interventions and outcomes, a narrative synthesis approach was used to structure the findings. Studies were clustered around common diagnostic stewardship interventions where appropriate. A citation count per year was presented using bar charts to highlight the field’s growth within this area over time. A geographical location map of the study location was used to identify any commonality regarding areas of use of diagnostic stewardship [27]. A citation map was generated using Litmaps citation mapping software to assess the inter-relationship of citations within this field and help review the success of forward and backward citation searching within this area of study [28]. To visualize the type of intervention/stage of process of interventions defined as diagnostic stewardship, a visual representation of number of studies per stage was generated.

Results

A total of 2556 records were identified from the initial search. After duplicate removal, a total of 1310 citations were identified, with 237 articles retrieved after title and abstract screening and 105 studies (n = 109 citations) included in the scoping review following full-paper screening. For the 10 % verification process, substantial agreement was achieved between all three reviewers (percentage of agreement: 86.23–88.67, Cohen’s k: 0.62–0.69).

The first study that classified their intervention to be a diagnostic stewardship approach was published in 2017 (see Fig. 1 for number of publications per year and Table 1 for full study characteristics). Subsequently, there has been a consistent increase in intervention studies classified as employing a diagnostic stewardship approach, with 26 studies recorded in the year 2020, and from this period, there has been ≥20 studies published each year.

Significantly fewer patients with indeterminate EIA results had PCR testing performed in the post-intervention vs pre-intervention group (66% vs 99.6%; P < 0.001). No significant differences in the number of patients treated for CDI between the two groups. For the 276 patients with a positive PCR, those in the post-intervention period were more likely to be treated: 87% in the pre-intervention period vs 95% in the post-intervention period (P = 0.04).

The Litmaps citation map demonstrates the current body of evidence which describes their intervention as diagnostic stewardship and their citation relationship (see Fig. 3 for Litmaps citation map of all included studies). However, there are some clusters of papers which seem to be detached from the main body of evidence and do not seem to be citing the current evidence within this area. The most internally cited study was by Madden et al. [29], which was cited 10 times by other studies within this scoping review. A total of 38 (36.2 %) papers remained uncited by any other paper within the confines of this scoping review.

Most studies that defined their intervention as adopting a diagnostic stewardship approach employed a before and after research design (n = 91, 86.6 %). Regrettably, it posed a challenge to consistently determine whether the studies followed a retrospective or prospective approach; therefore, it was decided for this not to be coded. The second most prevalent study design involved an interruptive time series, in which data were gathered both before, during and after the intervention (n = 9, 8.6 %). A limited number of studies incorporated a control group, with only four non-randomized controlled trials and one randomized controlled trial.

Studies varied in size ranging from small studies which used 77 samples to larger studies which used 224 573 samples. Diagnostic stewardship interventions were primarily implemented in entire clinical hospitals, with 36 studies (34.3 %) conducted at tertiary care facilities and 14 (13.3 %) at secondary care facilities. Fewer studies focused on specific clinical settings, including paediatric ICU (n = 4, 3.8 %), adult ICU (n = 3, 2.9 %), emergency department (n = 3, 2.9%), quaternary paediatric care (n = 2, 1.9%), quaternary care (n = 1, 1 %), paediatric tertiary care (n = 1, 1 %), paediatric emergency department (n = 1, 1 %), neurology ICU (n = 1, 1 %), army medical facility (n = 1, 1 %) and stem cell transplant and haematology (n = 1, 1 %). The remaining studies either only indicated that the intervention was undertaken in an inpatient setting, but no specific description of care was given (n = 21), or the type of setting was not described (n = 16). Among the included studies, 70 were conducted in a single centre, while 25 studies occurred across multiple centres. In 10 studies, the number of clinical settings where the intervention took place was not specified.

Within the included studies, the most common sample types which the diagnostic stewardship intervention focused upon were stool (diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection n = 52, 49.5 %, infective gastroenteritis n = 1, 1 %), urine (urinary tract infection n = 20, 19%), blood (n = 18, 14.1 %; BCs n = 10, 9.5 %; procalcitonin n = 2, 1.9 %; candidaemia n = 2, 1.9 %; hepatitis C virus n = 1, 1 %; thyroid function tests n = 1, 1 %; beta-d-glucan n = 1, 1%; blood gases n = 1, 1 %) and cerebrospinal fluid samples (meningitis/encephalitis n = 4, diagnosis of West Nile virus n = 1, 1 %). The remaining studies used respiratory (respiratory infections n = 2, 1.9 %; SARS CoV-2 n = 1, 1%) blood and sputum (community-acquired pneumonia n = 2), endotracheal aspirate (ventilator-associated infection n = 1, 1 %), wound swab (skin and soft tissue infections n = 1, 1 %) and multiple samples (multiple infections n = 1, 1 %), and one study did not specify what type of sample was used.

The outcomes used to assess interventions defined as diagnostic stewardship varied but could be categorized under four main categories. Of these four categories, the most common outcome reported was test usage (n = 74, 70.5 %); this was typically measured either as number of tests over the data collection period or reported as an incidence rate over a given period. The second most common reported outcome was the number of positive tests (n = 63, 60 %); this was mainly reported as a ratio or a percentage. The joint third most recorded outcomes were patient outcomes (n = 32, 30.5 %); these were typically linked to the diagnostic test (e.g. in-hospital mortality, length of stay and days of therapy). Similarly, protocol/process-related outcomes were reported in 32 studies (30.5 %); these outcomes were regarding compliance to test protocol/process in both ordering the correct test and carry out the test within set criteria such as within a given period. The fourth most common outcome reported was regarding cost assessment (n = 15, 14.3 %), typically reported as cost saving over a given period. The least common outcome reported was sensitivity and specificity of the nearly adaptive tests protocol (n = 4, 3.8 %).

As depicted in Fig. 4, the pre-analytical phase is the predominant stage for intervention instances (n = 74, 70.5 %). These interventions commonly follow a restrictive strategy, manifested either as a decisive halt, where clinicians are prohibited from further test requests (n = 40, 38.1 %), or in a more nuanced form known as a soft stop. In the latter case, a decision support tool is employed to guide and facilitate the test selection process (n = 23, 21.9 %). Altogether, when aggregated, these findings revealed that 60 % of the identified studies described the intervention as diagnostic stewardship, primarily adopting a restrictive approach.

Education emerges as the third most prevalent intervention type within the pre-analytical stage (n = 6, 5.7 %). While a considerable portion of soft stop interventions usually involved an educational element, it was determined that education was not the primary approach employed in these instances. The remaining four studies used laboratory assessment of test appropriateness (n = 3, 2.9 %), machine learning (n = 1, 1 %) and agile implementation model (n = 1, 1 %)-based interventions. There were three studies which were unclear regarding the exact stage of intervention (n = 3, 2.9 %).

The analytical phase saw the fewest number of studies (n = 7, 6.7 %), with the primary strategy being the adoption of an enhanced alternative test method (n = 6, 5.7 %). The sole remaining study utilized an intervention around the rejection of poor-quality samples.

A minimal number of studies implemented interventions during the post-analytical stage of testing (n = 8, 7.6 %). The predominant approach across most studies involved automatic reflective testing interventions (n = 6, 5.7 %). The last two studies employed interventions involving the modification of laboratory reporting procedures and the withholding of results until patient review by expert.

A limited number of studies implemented interventions across multiple stages (n = 13, 12.4 %). The studies which used multiple interventions across various phases used a wide range of intervention types. In three studies, pinpointing the precise stage of intervention delivery proved challenging due to the limited level of detail provided in the intervention descriptions. A full list of classifications of each intervention stage and intervention description can be seen within Fig. 4 and Table 1.

Discussion

In the current published literature, the term diagnostic stewardship is utilized with considerable frequency appearing in 105 papers. Despite this high prevalence of its use, the term has only been used to describe interventions taking place within studies for the last 7 years. However, it is notable that there has been a consistent increase in its use throughout this period, with this term being used in over 20 papers per year for the last 4 years. Subsequently highlighting the vogue of this term within the scholarly literature. The published literature appears to be building upon its own foundation, evidenced by the prevalent practice of mutual citation within the majority of papers. On visual inspection, there appears to be multiple citation loops suggesting a reciprocal process where studies cite and draw upon each other, contributing to a collective and evolving understanding of the subject matter. However, there still seems to be pockets of research which are not referring to previous diagnostic stewardship studies.

Despite some variation in the evidence base, it is apparent that there are common characteristics that may determine people’s understanding of the concept of diagnostic stewardship and its application in practice. Diagnostic stewardship appears to have been adopted mainly in the USA, where it is utilized as a rather unsubtle instrument to curtail the rigours of clinical testing. This is evident through the stages of intervention and the subsequent reported outcomes. More than 60 % of all studies that identified their intervention as employing diagnostic stewardship utilized a restrictive approach (hard or soft stop). Furthermore, the emphasis on process outcomes, specifically the sheer quantity of tests conducted and the tally of negative results, dominates the discourse. Other aspects, such as improved patient outcomes and reduced patient harms of inappropriate testing, were only cited in a third of studies. The environmental impact of unnecessary testing was absent. Regrettably, the absence of supplementary data reporting the sensitivity and precision of the testing process, coupled with a dearth of comprehensive insights into patient outcomes, leaves the concept of diagnostic stewardship largely unrealized. In deviating from its intended use as defined by the WHO, diagnostic stewardship has become a basic tool employed not to improve but to limit the amount of testing undertaken [23]. Therefore, future research aiming to incorporate the principles of diagnostic stewardship should take a more holistic approach by integrating the concepts of timeliness, process efficiency and efficient patient care [23].

Regarding the area of application of diagnostic stewardship interventions, this scoping review reveals that the term diagnostic stewardship is used predominantly in the field of infectious diseases rather than other pathology disciplines. This may be due to the overlapping concept of antimicrobial stewardship, and its common aim is to utilize resources appropriately [30]. It is somewhat surprising that none of the papers returned in the searches are related to diagnostic stewardship of SARS-CoV-2 testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially considering the vast numbers of tests performed globally. This may be related to the individual governmental drives to increase testing and early calls from WHO to ‘test test test test’ [31].

It is clear that the foundational principles regarding the timeliness and appropriateness of testing are not routinely being employed, highlighting the focus on restriction rather than enhancement. This phenomenon may, in part, be attributed to the influence of specific local or national policies on the trajectory of diagnostic stewardship interventions. For example, several studies looking to improve the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in the USA noted the financial penalties that an institution would be liable for [32]. In other studies, the focus was on reducing the incorrect diagnosis of hospital-onset CDI, for which care would not be reimbursable [33] rather than focusing on the enhancement of the test protocol itself. With a focus that is mainly on the field of infectious diseases, the current approaches of diagnostic stewardship exhibit alignment with ‘demand optimization’, which is a term currently used within the UK initiative ‘Getting It Right First Time’ [34]. Similarly, the approach described as ‘Choosing Wisely’ in the USA seems to be similarly aligned with the current interpretation of diagnostic stewardship, where healthcare workers choose only the tests that are supported by evidence, are not duplicative, are free from harm and are truly necessary [35]. Therefore, despite the WHO’s advocacy for an ideology that champions a more comprehensive approach to quality improvement, it may be more fitting to consider alternative regional narratives when categorizing these types of quality improvement interventions.

From a methodological perspective, studies describing interventions as diagnostic stewardship were often undermined by specific limitations in their study design, which should be addressed in future research. Given that most studies adopted a before and after research design, it was evident that very few used a control group as a comparator and even fewer used random allocation. These limitations increased any uncertainties in the findings. It is important for researchers to direct their efforts towards enhancing methodological rigour in future research. Where it is possible and applicable, randomized control trial methodologies should be employed, thereby strengthening the credibility and reliability of the research outcomes within this domain. The sample size of the projects varied markedly, and they were generally conducted within a single hospital rather than across multiple centres. This could indicate that research in this field for such interventions might be in its early stages of development. Typically, the studies were conducted in either a tertiary or secondary care setting, with only a few studies concentrating on specific clinical areas exclusively, suggesting a more centralized rather than global approach.

The scoping review had certain strengths and limitations. Despite employing a multi-database search approach, the search strategy used a relatively narrow set of terms to pinpoint relevant studies. Our rationale was grounded in the expectation that studies would commonly incorporate the term ‘diagnostic stewardship’ within the searchable text. This decision may have influenced the review by potentially reducing the recall of relevant studies. Furthermore, due to the period of time which has passed since the search was conducted, it is possible, based on the pattern of publications per year, that additional papers in this field have been published. The process of study selection involved three distinct single reviewers. Nevertheless, we managed to attain elevated levels of agreement among these individual reviewers during the abstract and title screening process, demonstrating good inter-rater reliability. Likewise, the data extraction phase engaged three separate single reviewers, which, akin to the screening process, could potentially introduce errors due to lack of verification. This was a pragmatic decision due to lack of resources for this stage of the scoping review. During the data extraction process, the team engaged in discourse about any challenges encountered, seeking assistance from senior screeners for clarification when data items were unclear.

Conclusion

The approach of diagnostic stewardship appears to be a recent development and is gaining popularity. Studies that define their intervention as adopting a diagnostic stewardship approach are predominantly from the USA. This observation may indicate the influence of regional policy and practice drivers promoting this approach. However, diagnostic stewardship seems to have deviated from its intended course, morphing into a rather rudimentary instrument wielded not to enhance but to constrict the scope of testing. This is reflected in the majority of studies focusing on test reduction rather than test enhancement. Despite the WHO’s advocacy for an ideology that promotes a more holistic approach to quality improvement, it may be more appropriate to consider alternative regional narratives when categorizing these types of quality improvement interventions.
