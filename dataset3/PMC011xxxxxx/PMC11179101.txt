An 81-year-old woman with heart failure with normal ejection fraction was diagnosed with mitral annular calcification (MAC) causing moderate–severe mitral disease. Heart team decision was to evaluate candidacy for a valve-in-MAC (ViMAC) procedure due to high anatomic and surgical risk (STS score 12.9%, Euroscore II 5.36%). Pre-procedural CT showed feasibility for ViMAC based on mitral annular area and a MAC score of 8 (Panel A), but predicted a significant risk of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction with a neoLVOT area of 129 mm2 (Panel B). To address this, alcohol septal ablation (ASA) was performed. Follow-up CT showed a substantial increase in neoLVOT area to 411 mm2, strikingly reducing the obstruction risk (Panel C).

For procedural planning, a novel approach utilizing patient-specific simulation and multimaterial 3D printing was adopted to replicate cardiac anatomy. This allowed successful implantation of a 29 mm SAPIEN 3 valve, closely mirroring the steps needed in the actual procedure (Panel D). This precision medicine approach was further pursued by briefing the interventional team on every critical step of the procedure and bailout options. This resulted in a smooth procedure with implantation of the 29 mm SAPIEN 3 valve under fluoroscopic and transoesophageal echo guidance, as predicted by simulation (Panels E–H). The patient’s post-procedural recovery was excellent, with significant symptom improvement and no hospital readmissions.

This case exemplifies the importance of ASA in preventing LVOT obstruction during transcatheter mitral valve replacements and showcases a custom-tailored procedural planning method, highlighting the potential of precision medicine in complex cardiac interventions.
