The development of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers capable of detecting α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in vivo would represent a breakthrough for advancing the understanding and enabling the early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. It also holds the potential to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. However, this remains challenging due to different structures of α-syn aggregates, the need for selectivity over other structurally similar amyloid proteins, like amyloid-β (Aβ), which frequently coexist with α-syn pathology, and the low abundance of the target in the brain that requires the development of a high-affinity ligand. To develop a successful PET tracer for the central nervous system (CNS), stringent criteria in terms of polarity and molecular size must also be considered, as the tracer must penetrate the blood–brain barrier and have low nonspecific binding to brain tissue. Here, we report a series of arylpyrazolethiazole (APT) derivatives, rationally designed from a structure–activity relationship study centered on existing ligands for α-syn fibrils, with a particular focus on the selectivity toward α-syn fibrils and control of physicochemical properties suitable for a CNS PET tracer. In vitro competition binding assays performed against [3H]MODAG-001 using recombinant α-syn and Aβ1–42 fibrils revealed APT-13 with an inhibition constant of 27.8 ± 9.7 nM and a selectivity of more than 3.3 fold over Aβ. Radiolabeled [11C]APT-13 demonstrated excellent brain penetration in healthy mice with a peak standardized uptake value of 1.94 ± 0.29 and fast washout from the brain (t1/2 = 9 ± 1 min). This study highlights the potential of APT-13 as a lead compound for developing PET tracers to detect α-syn aggregates in vivo.

Misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological aggregates that accumulate in the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD), and other α-synucleinopathies, such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).1 PD is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting in reduced dopamine levels in the brain, which causes typical PD-related motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability.2 Although these symptoms typically become clinically evident during the intermediate stages of the disease, the underlying pathology likely begins years earlier in the olfactory bulb and lower brainstem.3 The protein accumulation progressively spreads to other central nervous system (CNS) regions in a self-promoting pathological process, causing the disease to progress.4 Currently, α-syn inclusions in the brain can only be detected through histological examination of post-mortem brain tissue or inferred by measuring misfolded α-syn protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid.5 Thus, the possibility of detecting and quantifying α-syn deposition in vivo in the brain would represent a breakthrough achievement for the field. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive imaging technique that uses radioactive ligands to localize and quantify specific targets in vivo with high sensitivity. Such a method can enable the detection of α-syn aggregates with accuracy when a suitable radioligand is utilized. This makes PET a valuable tool for the study of disease progression and novel drug development, as well as for early and accurate diagnosis in patients.

Diagnosing the disease at the earliest possible stage is crucial, as early intervention will be essential to limiting the neurodegenerative progression when therapies become available.

Developing a PET tracer for α-syn aggregates faces several challenges. Considering the density of binding sites in the target pathology, aggregated α-syn is low in abundance, necessitating a high-affinity ligand, most likely in the subnanomolar range, that is also selective for α-syn relative to amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau aggregates, which are often colocalized and structurally similar.5 Since most of α-syn is localized intracellularly, a successful PET tracer would have to cross the cell membrane to engage its target in addition to the blood–brain barrier (BBB) through passive diffusion.5 The BBB penetrance should be high, with a recommended standard uptake value (SUV) above 1.0 within a few minutes.6 A low signal-to-noise ratio in the brain interferes with quantification and can hinder the imaging of pathological α-syn. Therefore, the tracer should have a low nondisplaceable binding (NDB).6 As a “rule of thumb”, candidate CNS PET agents should be moderately lipophilic (logD7.4 = 1–3)7 and relatively small (<500 Da)8,9 to achieve the desired outcome parameters. Although several small molecules have been identified that bind to α-syn fibrils10 (Figure 1), so far, none have been translated to clinical routine as a result of poor selectivity toward α-syn or inadequate pharmacokinetic profiles.

(n.d. = not determined).

Recently, significant advancements have been made in detecting pathological α-syn deposits. The ligand [18F]ACI-12589 demonstrated promising results, showing high affinity and specificity for α-syn aggregates in in vitro autoradiography (AR) and homogenate binding assays of MSA and PD tissues. Clinical evaluations revealed its effective binding in MSA patients in regions associated with α-syn pathology, although it did not bind in PD patients.11 However, its off-target binding to monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), as indicated by preblocking experiments with selegiline, highlights a limitation. Another ligand, [18F]F0502B, exhibited good binding affinity in the single-digit nanomolar range to human brain lysates and high selectivity against Aβ fibrils in vitro. This ligand retained in the brain of macaques injected with α-syn preformed fibrils and adeno-associated virus α-syn A53T.12 However, the absence of a quantitative kinetic and metabolic analysis of [18F]F0502B limits its current understanding. Furthermore, [11C]MODAG-005 has recently been published, but to date it has only been evaluated on one patient.13

Given these findings, there is a pressing need to explore further and develop new tracer candidates that meet all the requirements for a CNS PET tracer suitable for clinical applications. Here, we report the design, synthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a series of low molecular weight arylpyrazolethiazole (APT) derivatives with optimized lipophilicity. This structural class demonstrates nanomolar range binding affinities and high selectivity for α-syn over Aβ fibrils (3.3 to 20.7-fold), underscoring their potential of effective CNS PET tracers.

Results and Discussion

Molecular Design of the APT Library

A common feature of the reported α-syn ligands is the presence of a multiple conjugated aromatic rings system: they can consist of an aromatic ring, which is generally a varied substituted benzene ring, with or without heteroatoms; a central core, usually a chalcone system,14 or a heterocycle;15−17 and a second aromatic ring, such as a benzene ring or heterocycle (Figure 1).

Anle138b, the first described diphenylpyrazole (DPP) derivative,15 is a promising drug candidate against α-synucleinopathies due to its ability to inhibit the aggregation of α-syn oligomers. However, it has unfavorable properties as a PET tracer due to its high lipophilicity (calculated logP for anle138b = 4.34).

Moreover, [11C]MODAG-001,16 a recently developed derivative of anle138b15 with enormous potential as a very high-affinity ligand for α-syn fibrils and excellent ability to penetrate the mouse brain, showed no detectable binding in in vitro AR in brain sections of Lewy body dementia (LBD), possibly due to high nonspecific binding (NSB), as well as concomitant moderate binding affinity to Aβ fibrils (reported Kd for Aβ1–42 = 20 ± 10 nM) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain tissue. Both high lipophilicity and low selectivity over other amyloid protein aggregates are well-known hurdles against the development of imaging agents. Nevertheless, the DPP class of compounds provides a promising template for further structure–activity relationship (SAR)-based research of small molecule ligands for α-syn aggregates. Recently, it has been shown that the pyrazole ring in anle138b15 significantly contributes to its binding affinity. Antonschmidt and colleagues elucidated a possible binding mode of anle138b using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies.18 Anle138b establishes stable polar interactions with the backbone moieties inside a tubular cavity of the fibrils either through hydrogen bonds via the pyrazole ring or halogen bonds involving the bromine atom.18

Recently, Uzuegbunam et al. identified a class of potent α-syn ligands consisting of bisthiazole-based analogs, pointing out that the inclusion of a methylenedioxy functional group in the structure significantly enhances binding affinity and selectivity for α-syn fibrils.17 A 1,3-benzodioxole moiety is also recurrent in other known ligands with high affinity for α-syn aggregates, including anle138b.15,17,19 Furthermore, in known classes of compounds, a thiazole ring is reported for some selective ligands for α-syn over Aβ.17,20

In this study, we designed a class of APT compounds in which a thiazole ring replaces a benzene ring of the DPP analogs. This substitution significantly decreased lipophilicity, as exemplified by the comparison between anle138b and APT-1 (Figure 2). APT-1 was designed as the starting scaffold for all further SAR studies.

Figure 2 (A) Structure of anle138b and APT-1. (B) Properties of some derivatives of the APT class of compounds; clogP, MW, and tPSA calculated with Chemicalize software; BBB score calculated with the Excel sheet provided in the literature.21clogP = calculated logP; MW = molecular weight; tPSA = topological polar surface area.

Figure 2 illustrates that the APT class of compounds exhibit promising calculated physicochemical properties, rendering them suitable for the development of a CNS PET tracers. We evaluated properties, including lipophilicity, topological polar surface area (tPSA), and a computational BBB permeability score.22 The BBB score is an algorithm proposed for predicting BBB penetration, in which molecules with a BBB score above 4 (with 6 being the highest) are more likely to penetrate the brain. All APTs have a calculated BBB score greater than 4.

Further modifications of APT-1 targeted three parts of the molecule:(A) The 1,3-dioxole was replaced in the para position to give the derivatives N,N-dimethylaniline, N-methylaniline, and N-(2-fluoroethyl)aniline. We assumed the significance of an electro-donating group in the para position to strengthen the hydrogen (H)-bond on the pyrazole ring and, in the case of the secondary amine, along with adding an electron bond donor. The inclusion of an N,N-dimethylaniline in MODAG-001 also proved beneficial16 (Figure 3A).

(B) Considering that pyrazoles can act as H-bond acceptors and donors with the amide hydrogens and carbonyl oxygens of a peptide backbone, the relevance of an H-bond donor (HBD) was investigated. To prove this, the pyrazole ring was replaced with a chalcone moiety as a bridging system. The N-methylpyrazole derivative was also included to further verify the observation that an HBD on the pyrazole improves binding to the pocket (Figure 3B).

(C) The thiazole ring was further substituted with halogens to favor hydrophobic interactions at the site (Figure 3C).

Figure 3 Modification of the APT-1 structure.

The direct comparison of the results obtained from modifying the three rings of APT-1 led to the identification of APT-13 as a lead compound. APT-13 exhibits the highest affinity for α-syn (Ki = 27.8 ± 9.7 nM) of the series with good selectivity over Aβ while also possessing favorable pharmacokinetic properties as a PET tracer (Figure 7). To further verify the significance of the pyrazole ring for high affinity, chalcone analog derivatives APT-11, APT-12, and APT-14 were also synthesized.

Chemical Synthesis

The chalcone derivatives were obtained via a base-catalyzed aldol condensation of the desired aldehyde substrate (Scheme 1, intermediates 1–3) with the corresponding ketone derivative to give the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl derivatives 5–14 (Scheme 2, general synthetic route A). The resulting chalcones 1H and 13C NMR spectra showed peaks consistent with a single product, with J = 15.8 Hz, suggesting that only the isomer E was formed.

In Vitro Competition Binding Assay on Recombinant α-Syn and Aβ Fibrils

Although α-syn aggregates represent the primary form of misfolded protein aggregates found in PD and other synucleinopathies, several studies have shown that Aβ aggregates often coincide with α-syn deposition. For in vivo application, probes targeting α-syn must exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity.

The APT library underwent in vitro testing to evaluate its binding affinity to human recombinant α-syn fibrils. Promising compounds were further tested on Aβ fibrils. Recent in silico studies have revealed that α-syn fibrils have multiple segments where binding can occur, and distinct classes of compounds can interact with different binding sites on the target.23 Since the DPP and APT class of compounds share similarities, the APT library was tested in a competition binding assay with [3H]MODAG-001 to determine its relative binding affinity and inhibition constant (Ki). The binding assay measured the displacement of the radioligand by increasing concentrations of competitor compounds, using fixed concentrations of fibrils and radioligand. The results demonstrated reciprocal competition in binding to the target, suggesting that the two compounds compete for the same binding site.

The replacement of a phenyl group with a thiazole ring in the DPP class, which led to APT-1, resulted in a moderate affinity for α-syn fibrils but a significantly lower binding to Aβ fibrils (Figure 4). Speculating that this modification could help improve selectivity to the target, we pursued further modification of scaffold 15 to enhance the binding affinity.

Figure 4 Binding affinity of APT-1. (A) Structure and binding affinity data on α-syn and Aβ (mean Ki ± SEM) of APT-1 determined by competition binding assay against [3H]MODAG-001; (B) competition binding assay curves on α-syn and Aβ fibrils for APT-1 against [3H]MODAG-001.

On ring A, modification of the 1,3-benzodioxole ring with an N-methylaniline led to an improved affinity for the target (Ki α-syn = 44.5 ± 11.2 nM), while maintaining a high Ki on Aβ (Ki Aβ = 381.0 ± 216.8 nM). Replacing the methyl group with a fluoroethyl moiety in APT-6, on the other hand, resulted in modest affinity, suggesting that the size of the substituent also plays a role in target binding (Figure 5A,B).

Figure 5 Results from competition binding assays against [3H]MODAG-001 on α-syn and Aβ fibrils. (A) Table with data, reported in MEAN Ki + SEM, three data points (dp); adp = 4, bdp = 2; n.d. = not determined. (B) Competition binding assay curves of groups A, B, and C on α-syn fibrils.

On ring B, the replacement of the pyrazole ring with an enone had no positive impact on the binding affinity of the ligand with α-syn. This could be due to low affinity for the target or the absence of competition with [3H]MODAG-001 on the same binding pocket. As expected, methylation of the pyrazole ring also resulted in a loss of competition, suggesting the importance of an H-bond donor at this position (Figure 5A,B).

Regarding ring C, the substitution of a thiazole with an oxazole ring resulted in reduced binding. The effect of a halogen on the thiazole ring was also tested. The 4-bromothiazole APT-4 was a better binder than the corresponding thiazole derivative APT-1, but replacing the bromine with fluorine led to a loss of binding. The 3-bromothiazole APT-9 also leads to poor binding. Notably, the presence of a 4-bromine on the thiazole ring further improves the selectivity over Aβ (Ki Aβ = 1030 ± 561.6 nM). The improvement of affinity with the bromine in the 4-position of the thiazole ring (APT-4 versus APT-1) can be attributed to strong halogen bond interaction with the target (Figure 5A,B). The halogen bond strength is strictly influenced by local changes in the electronic structure of the molecule.24 In 4-bromothiazole, the pyridine-like nitrogen in proximity to the halogen withdraws electron density, which increases the δ-hole and consequently its ability of halogen bonding. On the other hand, in 3-bromothiazole, the δ-hole of the bromine is surrounded by a negative surface due to the lone pair of the sulfur atom directed to the halogen. As a result, the bromine is less accessible to halogen bonding.

In general, these ligands demonstrated a much weaker affinity to Aβ than for α-syn fibrils, suggesting a general selectivity for α-syn over Aβ aggregates by this structural class.

Subsequent modifications of APT-1 involved the three different rings of the molecule, and APT-4 and APT-7 showed a good affinity for α-syn fibrils with high selectivity over Aβ of >8 and >20-fold, respectively. A second generation of compounds APT-11, APT-12, APT-13, and APT-14 were designed. Consistent with our previous results, APT-13 displayed the highest binding affinity to α-syn (Ki α-syn = 27.8 ± 9.7 nM), and although the selectivity over Aβ was reduced (Ki Aβ = 92.6 ± 48.8 nM), it is still >3-fold (Figure 6A,B). The increased binding on Aβ could be explained by the higher logP of compound APT-13 (clogP of APT-13 = 3.51 versus clogP of APT-1 = 2.61) due to the presence of a halogen in the structure.

Figure 6 (A) Development of APT-13. (B) Binding affinity results comparison of APT-7, APT-1, APT-4, and APT-13 shown in the binding competition curves (left) and Ki values (right) on α-syn (top) and Aβ (bottom). (C) Competition binding assay curves in comparison of APT-11, APT-12, APT-13, and APT-14 on α-syn (top) and APT-11, APT-12, APT-13 on Aβ (bottom).

It is important to note that APT-13 still binds to Aβ fibrils nearly five times less effectively than the DPP compound, MODAG-001 (reported Kd for Aβ1–42 = 20 ± 10 nM, and in this work, Kd for Aβ1–42 = 6.2 ± 3 nM, due to the use of a different fibrils batch). As expected, APT-12, the 4-bromothiazole chalcone derivative, exhibited low affinity for α-syn (Ki α-syn = 198.1 ± 142.3 nM) and no competition toward Aβ, and APT-11, the nonbrominated analog, appeared in a loss of binding affinity for α-syn fibrils (Ki α-syn = 1009 ± 34 nM). Also consistent with our previous results, APT-14, the N-methyl derivative of APT-4, resulted in a loss of competition (Figure 6C).

In summary, according to the data described above, general SAR conclusions are available for further optimization of binding affinity and selectivity on α-syn: for ring A, the substitution with an N-monomethylaniline, as it is also seen in the recently published MODAG-005,13 is better than the N,N-dimenthylaniline and 1,3-dioxole; for ring B, the presence of the pyrazole ring is required; for ring C, 4-bromo substituted thiazole favors binding to α-syn.

Synthesis of [11C]APT-13

APT-13 exhibited the highest affinity to α-syn aggregates among the compounds tested, with a Ki value of 27.8 ± 9.7 nM. Despite its selectivity over Aβ1–42 being lower than that of other APTs tested, it still exceeds a 3-fold difference, making it a potential candidate for pathological α-syn PET imaging. Furthermore, the N-methylaniline ring allows for 11C-methylation at this site.

[11C]APT-13 was radiolabeled by direct methylation of its aniline precursor 22 using [11C]methyl triflate ([11C]MeOTf) (Scheme 7). The methylation with [11C]MeOTf afforded [11C]APT-13 in a radiochemical yield (RCY) of 13.5 ± 1.8% (from trapped [11C]MeOTf to formulated tracer) and a molar activity (Am) of 98.7 ± 12.7 GBq/μmol.

Reagents and conditions: (a) [11C]CH3OTf, 2-butanone, 75 °C, 2 min.

LogD Determination and Serum Stability Assay of [11C]APT-13

High lipophilicity can drastically reduce the ability of a tracer to cross the BBB, as well as reduce the imaging resolution due to high NSB. Therefore, the logD value is an effective tool for the prediction of the response of a tracer. The logD value experimentally measured for [11C]APT-13 was 3.16 (Table S3).

To assess the stability of [11C]APT-13 against degradation, a serum stability assay was performed. The incubation of [11C]APT-13 with human serum at 37 °C did not show evidence of degradation within 90 min (Figure S5).

In Vivo PET Imaging of [11C]APT-13 in Mice

To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of [11C]APT-13 in vivo, wild-type mice (n = 3) were iv injected, and the organ distribution was assessed over 60 min with dynamic PET and anatomical MR imaging (Figure 7A). [11C]APT-13 demonstrated fast and high brain uptake with peak SUV of 1.94 ± 0.29 and rapid clearance from brain tissues (t1/2 = 9 ± 1 min) (Figure 7B). This result largely aligned with the BBB score prediction for APT-13, which was calculated to be 4.8.21 Tracer clearance was largest through the liver (SUV ≈ 5), and high uptake was also observed in the heart (SUV ≈ 6) and lungs (SUV ≈ 5). Uptake with fast clearance was also observed in the kidney, indicating renal excretion within the first few minutes (Figure 7C).

Conclusions

This study demonstrated APT-13 as a promising new ligand for α-syn aggregates. The low molecular weight compound, optimized for lipophilicity, was identified from a SAR study examining the three-ring systems of compound 15 (APT-1) as a scaffold. All compounds were readily accessed through efficient and easily scalable chemical syntheses. Notably, replacing a phenyl ring with a thiazole significantly improved selectivity for α-syn over Aβ, while maintaining high affinity for α-syn fibrils. Additionally, incorporating a bromine atom at position-4 of the thiazole ring enhanced its selective binding to α-syn aggregates and improved the affinity, presumably through a strong halogen bond interaction with the target. Additionally, this study confirmed the importance of the core pyrazole ring to act as a H-bond donor for ligand binding.

In vitro APT-13, identified after a SAR study of a library of APT, exhibited a binding affinity in the nanomolar range for α-syn fibrils (Ki = 27.8 ± 9.7 nM) and more than 3-fold greater selectivity over Aβ. However, it is important to note that structural differences between recombinant human fibrils and α-syn aggregates from human brain tissue have been reported25,26 and future studies using binding experiments in human pathological brain tissues and imaging studies in rodent models with different types of injected fibrils need to be considered. Furthermore, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy have unveiled various morphologies of α-syn fibrils, which appear to be distinct in PD compared to the protein folds found in MSA.26,27 Thus, characterization of differential binding to various fibril types will be of high interest in future work.

The potential of [11C]APT-13, methylated at the aniline group, as a desirable ligand for in vivo applications in detecting α-syn pathology was further supported by its excellent brain penetration and rapid washout from the brain.

Moreover, the APT class of compounds generally exhibited low activity on Aβ fibrils.

Consequently, the APT system presents a good candidate scaffold for developing low-lipophilic ligands that selectively bind to α-syn inclusions, serving as α-syn PET tracers.

General Procedures for the Synthesis of APTs

General procedure A:28 To a mixture of the corresponding ketone (1 mmol) and aldehyde (1.3 mmol) in ethanol, piperidine (1.5 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was refluxed at 70 °C under stirring. After the completion of the reaction (3–5 h), ethanol was distilled off, and the residue was poured into ice water. It was kept overnight in the refrigerator. The resulting solid was collected by filtration, washed with distilled water, and purified by flash column chromatography to get the corresponding thiazolyl chalcone in 46–94%.

Radiochemistry

Automated Synthesis of [11C]APT-13

[11C]CO2 was prepared by the bombardment of 14N2 target gas containing 1% O2 using a PETtrace 860 cyclotron (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). [11C]methyl iodide ([11C]MeI) was produced via gas phase conversion29 using a TRACERlab FX MeI module (GE Healthcare) and transferred to a TRACERlab FX M module (GE Healthcare). [11C]methyl triflate ([11C]MeOTf) was generated by the reaction of [11C]MeI with a silver triflate column in an in-flow-through process at 200 °C under helium gas flow. The precursor 22 (1–2 mg, 3–6 μmoles) was dissolved in 500 μL of 2-butanone. No carrier added [11C]MeOTf was bubbled through the reaction solution, previously cooled to −20 °C, and the mixture was heated to 75 °C for 2 min. After reaching room temperature, the solution was diluted with 1.5 mL of H2O and transferred to the HPLC system. The crude product was purified by semipreparative HPLC on a Supercosil LC-ABZ+, 5 μm, 250 × 10 mm column and eluted with an isocratic flow of 55% ACN in water at a flow rate of 6 mL/min with a retention time of 8.3 ± 0.4 min (Figure S1). Chromatograms were registered using a UV detector (254 nm) and a NaI radioactivity detector. The HPLC fraction containing the purified product was diluted with 50 mL of water and subsequently loaded onto a Sep-Pak Plus Light C18 cartridge (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), previously conditioned with 10 mL of ethanol and 10 mL of water. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL of water, and the product was eluted with 0.5 mL of ethanol and formulated with the addition of 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Radiochemical and chemical purity of the radiolabeled compound, as well as carrier content for calculation of molar radioactivity, were determined by analytical radio-HPLC on a 1260 Infinity HPLC-System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a NaI (Tl) scintillator system. Separation was achieved on a Luna C18(2), 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm column with 35% ACN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoracetic acid (TFA) as mobile phase and at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min in 10 min. The radiolabeled product was eluted at a retention time of 5.9 ± 0.2 min (Figure S2). At the end of the synthesis (EOS), the radiochemical yield (% RCY) was 13.5 ± 1.8% (from trapped [11C]MeOTf to formulated radioligand) and the Am was 119.6 ± 33.8 GBq/μmol.

Synthesis of [3H]MODAG-001

MODAG-001 was tritiated by RC Tritec AG, Teufen Switzerland. The Am was 2.9 GBq/μmol, and the radiochemical purity was >99%, as determined via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Biological Evaluation

Calculation of BBB Score

All compounds properties were calculated using Chemicalize software (ChemAxon, Budapest, Hungary) and entered into the Excel sheet provided in the literature for the calculation of BBB score.22 All values are reported in the Supporting Information (Table S1).

Preparation of α-Syn and Aβ1–42 Fibrils

α-Syn fibrils were generated as the previously reported method.30 The generation of Aβ1–42 fibril was adapted from Bagchi et al. and previously described by Kuebler et al.16,31 Synthetic lyophilized human Aβ1–42 peptide with >90% purity purchased from EMC Microcollections GmbH (Tuebingen, Germany) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 5 mg in 221.5 μL). Deionized water (4.1 mL) and 1 M Tris–HCl (111 μL, pH 7.6) were added to obtain a final monomeric concentration of 250 μM. Aggregation was induced by incubating the monomers in Eppendorf Thermomixer at 37 °C with shaking at 800 rpm for 72 h. Generated fibrils were sonicated for 3 min in a water bath (Elmasonic S 60H, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Singen, Germany). The final products were aliquoted, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C until use. Aβ1–42 fibril quality was evaluated via thioflavin (ThT) fluorescence and radioligand saturation assay with [3H]PiB and [3H]MODAG-001.

In Vitro Fibrils Binding Experiments

The dissociation constant (Kd) values of [3H]MODAG–001 for human recombinant α-syn and synthetic human Aβ1–42 fibrils have previously been determined using saturation binding assays.30 To determine the relative binding affinity (inhibition constant, Ki) of test compounds, competition binding assays of [3H]MODAG-001 were performed. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO to a stock concentration of 1 mM, which resulted in ≤1% DMSO concentration in the final assay. Human recombinant α-syn (50 nM) and synthetic human Aβ1–42 fibrils (1 μM) diluted in PBS (Gibco DPBS, no calcium, no magnesium, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were incubated with increasing concentrations of test compounds (5 pM to 10 μM) against 1 nM [3H]MODAG–001 in 30 mM Tris–HCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween20 in 96-well micro test low-binding plates (ratiolab GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) to a total volume of 200 μL/well. Plates were incubated on a shaker (MaxQ 6000, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Marietta, OH, USA) at 50 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C, covered by removable sealing tapes (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Vacuum filtration and read-out were performed as previously reported (Kuebler, Buss et al. 2021). Briefly, a glass fiber Filtermat B (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) incubated with 0.5% polyethylenimine (PEI; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) for 30 min at 4 °C before filter harvesting was used with a FilterMate Harvester (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Melt-on scintillator sheets (MeltiLex B/HS, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) were molten onto dried filters. Accumulation of tritium was counted in a liquid scintillation Wallac MicroBeta TriLux counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) at 2 min per well. Radioactivity in counts per minute for each concentration of the test compound was normalized to the radioactivity obtained in the absence of the test compound for conversion to percentage binding of the reference tracer. The resulting values were plotted against increasing concentrations of the test compounds. Data points were fitted using nonlinear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., Version 8.4.0, La Jolla, CA, USA). The binding curve for [3H]MODAG-001 saturation assay on α-syn fibrils is reported in the Supporting Information (Figure S6).

LogD Determination of APT-13

The logD was calculated experimentally by adding [11C]APT-13 (1.5 MBq) to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf vial containing 500 μL of octanol (OCT) and 500 μL of PBS. The vial was vigorously vortexed and then, to achieve effective phase separation, centrifuged. Aliquots of 350 μL were collected from both OCT and PBS phases. The OCT sample was further washed with 350 μL of PBS; the phases mixture was shaken and centrifuged, and 200 μL of both phases were taken into new reaction tubes. The amount of radioactivity in each sample was quantified using a γ-counter. The log OCT/PBS values were calculated from the mean of n = 3 determinations (Table S3).

Serum Stability Assay

Human serum was obtained from human male AB plasma, USA origin, sterile-filtered (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

The tracer formulation was mixed with an equal volume of human serum (250 μL) and incubated into a thermo-shaker at 37 °C, 300 rpm. At different time points (0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min), 70 μL samples were drawn and mixed with ice-cold acetonitrile (1:1 dilution) and quickly vortexed. The dilute sample was incubated for 2 min on ice and centrifuged (MiniSpin centrifuge, Eppendorf) for 2 min at 13,400 rpm. An aliquot of the supernatant (120 μL) was analyzed by analytical radio-HPLC on a Luna C18(2), 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm column with 35% ACN in 0.1% aqueous TFA as mobile phase and at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min in 10 min. The radiolabeled product was eluted at a retention time of 5.9 ± 0.2 min (Figure S5).

In Vivo PET/MR Imaging

Mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with the European directives on the protection and use of laboratory animals (Council Directive 2010/63/UE) and with the German animal protection law and with the approval of the local authorities (Regierungspräsidium Tuebingen (Germany), R3/19G). Healthy wild-type female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany).

To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of [11C]APT-13, PET and subsequent MRI scans were performed in healthy mice (female, 21 weeks old, C57BL/6J) to determine brain uptake and washout as well as organ uptake of the liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain. Scans were performed in a small animal Inveon PET scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and a 7T small animal MRI scanner (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). The mice (n = 3) were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane evaporated in 100% oxygen at a flow of 0.8 L/min, and a catheter was placed in the tail vein. The body temperature was kept at 37 °C by using a feedback temperature control unit for a heat pump that was connected to the PET bed. Five seconds after the start of the PET acquisition, 15.2 ± 0.5 MBq (410 ± 13 μCi) of [11C]APT-13 was injected intravenously. PET data were acquired in a dynamic scan for 60 min plus an extra 13 min of transmission measurement with a 57Co-source for attenuation correction. Subsequently, mice were placed in the same bed position in the MRI, and an anatomical scan was performed using a Turbo RARE T2 sequence. For analysis, the 60 min of acquired PET data were divided into 39-time frames (12 × 5, 6 × 10, 6 × 30, 5 × 60, and 10 × 300 s) and reconstructed using the OSEM3D reconstruction algorithm. The PET scans were coregistered to the whole-body MRI scan using PMOD software (version 4.203; PMOD Technologies, Zürich, Switzerland), and the volume of interest (VOI) of the different organs (liver, lungs, heart, kidney, and brain) were hand-drawn according to the anatomical localization. VOI were selected from the mouse brain atlas in PMOD, time activity curves were extracted, and SUV were calculated by normalizing to the injected activity and animal weight.
