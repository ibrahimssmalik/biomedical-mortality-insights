The subfamily Crotalinae (pitvipers) is the largest group of family Viperidae, with 294 species in 23 genera, and widely distributed in Asia and America (Speybroeck et al. 2016; Uetz et al. 2024). The mountain pitviper (Ovophis) is a group of medium-sized venomous snakes that are mainly distributed through eastern Asia, the southern Himalayas, and the northern Indochina Peninsula (Che et al. 2020). Within the genus, the distribution of O.monticola (Günther, 1864), O.makazayazaya (Takahashi, 1922), O.tonkinensis (Bourret, 1934), and O.zayuensis (Jiang, 1977) in China was supported and defined preliminarily by Malhotra et al. (2011) by molecular phylogenetic analyses (12S, 16S, cytb, and ND4) and comparative morphology. Subsequently, Zeng et al. (2023) revised the molecular phylogeny (cytb, ND4, BACH1, c-mos, NT3, and Rag1) with additional specimens. The result restricted the distribution of O.monticola to Zhangmu County (southern Xizang) in China, demarcated the populations that are distributed through Sichuan–Yunnan in the west to Taiwan in the east as O.makazayazaya, and introduced O.malhotraeZeng et al., 2023 as a new species representing the southern Yunnan population with its holotype description presented in non-paginationed supporting documents. The distribution of O.malhotrae is currently recorded only in Jinping and Pingbian, Yunnan and Lao Cai, Vietnam. MtDNA phylogenetic inference of the genus Ovophis and partial species of the rest of family Viperidae indicated when “O.” okinavensis (Boulenger, 1892) is included, genus Ovophis is polyphyletic, while “O.” okinavensis sistering Trimeresurusgracilis Oshima, 1920 (Malhotra and Thorpe 2000, 2004; Shi et al. 2021). Although the epithet change of “O.” okinavensis has not yet been declared, this species is no longer included in genus Ovophis in some recent taxonomic studies (Malhotra et al. 2011; Zeng et al. 2023). Currently, therefore, the genus Ovophis includes six species: O.monticola, O.convictus (Stoliczka, 1870), O.makazayazaya, O.tonkinensis, O.zayuensis, and O.malhotrae (Malhotra et al. 2011; Zeng et al. 2023; Uetz et al. 2024).

In 2018 and 2023, five specimens of genus Ovophis were collected in Yingjiang County, Yunnan. With applied comparative morphology and molecular phylogenetic analysis, these specimens were revealed as distinct from the other Ovophis species. Thus, we described here this new population as a new species.

﻿Materials and methods

﻿Sampling

Five specimens (IOZ 002679, IOZ 002680, YJ201801, YJ201802, and YJ201803) were collected by Zhong-Wen Jiang and Xian-Chun Qiu in October 2018 and 2023 from Tongbiguan Township, Yingjiang County, Yunnan Province, China. After euthanasia, liver tissues of specimens IOZ 002679 and IOZ 002680 were extracted and preserved in 95% ethanol for molecular analyses. All specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and then transferred to 75% ethanol for permanent preservation. The specimens IOZ 002679 and IOZ 002680 are deposited in the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOZ, Beijing, China). The specimens YJ201801, YJ201802, and YJ201803 are deposited in Beijing Forestry University (BFU, Beijing, China).

﻿Morphometrics

Morphological descriptions are accorded to Zhao (2006). Abbreviations are accorded to Darko et al. (2022). A total of 24 morphological characters were examined, including 11 mensural characters and 13 scalation characters. Morphological measurements were taken with digital calipers (Guanglu 111N-101V, accuracy 0.03 mm, Guanglu Digital Instruments, Guilin) to the nearest 0.1 mm. Abbreviations are as follows: SVL snout–vent length (distance from tip of snout to posterior margin of cloacal plate); TAL tail length (distance from posterior margin of cloacal plate to tip of tail); TL total length (distance from tip of snout to tip of tail); HL head length (distance from tip of rostral to posterior end of jaw); HW head width (maximum width of head); HH head height (maximum height between dorsal and ventral surfaces of head); ED eye diameter (horizontal eye diameter); IOD interorbital distance (distance between the top margin of eyes); IN internarial distance (distance between nostrils); RH maximum rostral height; RW maximum rostral width; LOR loreal; PRO preoculars; PO postoculars; SBO suboculars; ATEM anterior temporals; PTMP posterior temporals; SL supralabials; IL infralabials; CS chin shields; DSR dorsal scale rows (counted at one head length behind head, at midbody, and one head length before vent); PRV preventral scales (elongated scales situtated beneath the head before the ventrals); VS ventral scales (elongated scales situtated beneath the body between neck and vent); SC subcaudal scales.

Other morphological characters of Ovophis species were obtained from Zhao et al. (1998), Li et al. (2010), Neang et al. (2011), Sharma et al. (2013), Che et al. (2020), Guo et al. (2021), Huang (2021), and Zeng et al. (2023).

﻿Phylogenetic analyses

Four mtDNA sequences are specifically amplified in this study: 12S rRNA using primers 12SFPhe and 12SRVal (Knight and Mindell 1993); 16S rRNA using primers 16sFL and 16sRH (Palumbi et al. 1991); cytochrome b (cytb) using primers L14910 and H16064 (Burbrink et al. 2000); and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) using primers ND4F and LEUR (Arévalo et al. 1994). The standard PCR protocol is performed in 20 μl of reactant with at least 20 ng of template DNA and 10 pmol of primers. The PCR conditions: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles, denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, 30 s of annealing at different temperatures (52 °C for 12S, 50 °C for 16S, 56 °C for ND4, and 48 °C for cytb), and then elongation at 72 °C for 60 s, then finalized with elongation step of 10 min at 72 °C. Sequencing was conducted by Beijing Tianyi Huiyuan Bio-tech Co., Ltd. Sequence data were uploaded to GenBank (Table 1).

Note: The missing data are marked as “–”.

Corresponding homologous sequences of Ovophis species were obtained from GenBank, and the sequences of Viperaberus (Linnaeus, 1758) were used as outgroup in the phylogenetic analysis (Zeng et al. 2023). DNA nucleotide sequences were aligned in MEGA 6 (Tamura et al. 2013) with Clustal W algorithm, default parameters (Thompson et al. 1997). PartitionFinder 2.1.1 (Lanfear et al. 2012) was used to test the best partitioning scheme. Pairwise sequence divergence (uncorrected p-distances) was calculated using MEGA 6.

Bayesian inference was performed using MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist et al. 2011). All searches consisted of three heated chains and a single cold chain. Three independent iterations each comprising two runs of 100 million generations, sampled every 10,000 generations, and parameter estimates were plotted against generation. The first 25% of the samples were discarded as burn-in, resulting in a potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) of < 0.005. A maximum-likelihood analysis was run with RaxML (Silvestro and Michalak 2012), and a majority rule consensus tree was calculated with 1,000 bootstrap replicates.

﻿Results

﻿Molecular phylogeny

A total of 2,703 aligned base pairs were obtained including 441 bp from 12S, 465 bp from 16S, 1,110 bp from cytb, and 687 bp from ND4. With respect to the different evolutionary characters of each molecular marker, the dataset was split into five partitions by genes and codon positions as recommended by PartitionFinder 2.1.1 (Table 2). The topological structures of the maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian-inference (BI) trees are generally consistent (Fig. 1). All Ovophis samples are divided into seven clades. The cladistic relationship within the group of samples from Yingjiang was resolved with strong support (1.00/100 for BI and ML). The Yingjiang group is sister to the O.monticola group with decent support (1.00/99 for BI and ML), and the group of “Yingjiang”+O.monticola clustered with O.convictus, and formed a larger clade sister to the O.malhotrae+O.zayuensis lineage.

The uncorrected p-distance based on cytb gene between the specimens IOZ 002679, IOZ 002680 from Yingjiang, Yunnan and O.monticola is 6.2–6.5%, equivalent to those among other recognized species, such as O.malhotrae vs. O.zayuensis (6.0–6.7%) (Table 3). Thus, the molecular phylogeny supports the validity of Ovophisjenkinsi sp. nov.

Paratype.IOZ 002680 and YJ201801, adult females from Tongbiguan Township, Yingjiang County, Yunnan Province, China (24°35′04″N, 97°41′13″E; 1,321 m a.s.l.) collected by Zhong-Wen Jiang and Xian-Chun Qiu in October 2023 and 2018; juveniles YJ201802 and YJ201803 from the same locality collected by Zhong-Wen Jiang in October 2018.

Etymology.

The specific epithet of the new species is dedicated to Robert “Hank” William Garfield Jenkins AM (August 1947–September 2023), a herpetologist and former chairman of the CITES Animals Committee from Australia, with a passion for snakes, especially pitvipers, and helped China, along with many Asian countries, complete snake census, conservation, and management projects. We suggest the common name “Jenkins’ mountain pitviper” in English and “yíng jiāng lào tiě tóu shé” (盈江烙铁头蛇) in Chinese.

Distribution and ecology.

Ovophisjenkinsi sp. nov. is currently known only from Yingjiang County, Yunnan Province, China. It was found in the tropical montane rainforest at an altitude of around 1,300 m. Overlapping herpetofauna includes Lycodonchapaensis (Angel & Bourret, 1933), Trimeresuruspopeiorum Smith, 1937, PseudocalotesjingpoXu et al., 2024, and other species (Xu et al. 2024). The new species reaches activity peak in autumn and is active nocturnally during light rain or high humidity, at temperatures around 15–22 °C (Fig. 5). The type specimens were collected at night in October. When threatened, these snakes inflate their bodies to make themselves appear larger and strike quickly. The specimen IOZ 002680 had released odour from the cloacal scent glands when captured. We are currently unsure of the feeding habit of O.jenkinsi sp. nov. in the wild. They fed on juvenile mice (Musmusculus Linnaeus, 1758) in our captivity observations. Therefore, we presume the species prey on small mammals in the wild.

﻿Discussion

The phylogenetic topology in this study supports Zeng et al. (2023): Ovophismalhotrae sistering O.zayuensis (Zeng et al. 2023). However, the phylogenetic topology in this study differs from previous publications (Malhotra et al. 2011; Zeng et al. 2023). In this study, O.tonkinensis clustered with all other congeners (excluding “O.” okinavensis), while it clustered with O.makazayazaya in Malhotra et al. (2011) and Zeng et al. (2023). Thus, introducing a larger quantity of genetic dataset is suggested when conducting further phylogenetic studies of genus Ovophis.

In recent years, new snake species have been discovered constantly near the Yunnan border (Jiang et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2021; Hou et al. 2021; Lee 2021; Liu et al. 2021; Shi et al. 2022; Ma et al. 2023). Zeng et al. (2023) described the new species O.malhotrae based on specimens from southern Yunnan, and its molecular systematic position indicated that several populations from Vietnam and Laos may refer to cryptic species of the genus Ovophis. Thus, snake diversity in this region may have been underestimated in previous studies.

According to field surveys and recent publications, we identified updated distribution sites of Ovophis species in China (Zhang et al. 2011; Che et al. 2020; Zeng et al. 2023; Uetz et al. 2024) (Fig. 6). In Yunnan, O.makazayazaya is widely distributed in most parts of the province, O.zayuensis in the Gaoligong Mountain region of western Yunnan, and O.malhotrae in Jinping and Pingbian in southeastern Yunnan (Wang et al. 2022; Zeng et al. 2023). In some areas, there may be overlapping distributions of O.makazayazaya and other congeners. The specimens of “Trimersurusmonticola” from Hotha, Longchuan County, Yunnan Province, cited by Anderson (1878a), displayed intra-specific polymorphism: the second supralabial completed or divided from the anterior of loreal pit, consistent with the character of O.makazayazaya (Guo et al. 2021). Further examinations through photos of the specimen that was recorded by Anderson (1878b) were conducted and showed that it displays 10 supralabials, the second divided from the loreal pit and fourth larger than third, suggesting taxonomic placement under O.makazayazaya. However, since Longchuan County is adjacent to Yingjiang County, and in specimens from Hotha, Longchuan, the second supralabial also reaches the loreal pit, they should belong to O.jenkinsi sp. nov. In addition, Yingjiang County, Yunnan Province is located on the border of China and is adjacent to Myanmar; thus, the new species may also be distributed in Myanmar.

The new species is morphologically most similar to O.monticola, but can be distinguished by morphological characters such as wider head, fewer ventrals, trapezoidal patches on dorsal body, and deep orange-brown or dark brownish-grey dorsal surface rather than yellowish brown. In the specimens examined, the new species has a maximum TL of 690 mm (specimen YJ201801), while O.monticola appears to be larger, with a maximum TL of 1,300 mm (Sharma et al. 2013). We will collect more specimens of O.jenkinsi sp. nov. in the future to supplement the morphological data. Molecular phylogenetic analyses show O.jenkinsi sp. nov. is genetically differentiated from O.malhotrae (p-distance 10.2–11.0). Currently, only the holotype of O.malhotrae is described in supporting documents, the intraspecific variation of this species is unclear. It is, therefore, suggested that additional samples from along the Yunnan border and adjacent areas would enrich the current morphological dataset of O.jenkinsi sp. nov., O.malhotrae, and other Ovophis species and support further biodiversity discoveries.
