We present a genome assembly from an individual male Anania crocealis (the Ochreous Pearl; Arthropoda; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Crambidae). The genome sequence is 624.0 megabases in span. Most of the assembly is scaffolded into 29 chromosomal pseudomolecules, including the Z sex chromosome. The mitochondrial genome has also been assembled and is 15.33 kilobases in length. Gene annotation of this assembly on Ensembl identified 20,293 protein coding genes.

Background

The Ochreous Pearl, Anania crocealis (Hübner, 1796), is a crambid moth with a wingspan of about 22–25 mm ( Goater, 1986), forewing length 11–12 mm ( Sterling & Parsons, 2018), its forewings pale yellow with the very small reddish brown orbicular and reniform stigmata bounded by a convex basal transverse line and a distal transverse line which is concave around the outer stigma, and whitish grey hindwings; the terminal line in both wings is also reddish-brown. It is similar to a few other UK Pyraustinae such as Paratalanta hyalinalis (Hübner, 1796) as well and the whiter Paracorsia repandalis ([Denis & Schiffermüller], 1775] but differs in the relatively unmarked hindwings. Like many pyraustines, it has a triangular resting posture.

The adult moth flies in the UK from late June to August ( Goater, 1986; Parsons & Clancy, 2023), and the moth is regarded as univoltine or sometimes bivoltine flying up to September or even November in the south of the UK ( Parsons & Clancy, 2023; Sterling & Parsons, 2018). The adult moth is mainly nocturnal but easily disturbed around the foodplant by day.

The Ochreous Pearl has a preference for marshy and damp habitats in the UK as well as drier slopes on chalk where its larval foodplants occur (Common Fleabane, Pulicaria dysenterica (L.) Bernh., Ploughman’s Spikenard Pentanema squarrosum (L.) D.Gut.Larr., Santos-Vicente, Anderb., E.Rico & M.M.Mart.Ort. as well as, in Austria, Buphthalmum salicifolium L.; all Asteraceae; Kettner, 2023). The black headed larvae also with a black prothoracic plate and pale grey green with a darker green dorsal line, start out under a downturned leaf margin, later feeding among silk inside the shoots ( Parsons & Clancy, 2023; Sterling & Parsons, 2018).

A. crocealis is more or less common and widespread in southern parts of the United Kingdom, occurring more locally in Ireland, Wales, northwest England and Scotland where scarce, as well as Isle of Man and Channel Islands ( Parsons & Clancy, 2023). In Europe it occurs widely from western France to Eastern Europe, the far south of Scandinavia, as far as the eastern edge of the Black Sea, with a few records in north-west Africa (Morocco), north-eastern Spain, Italy, Greece, Croatia and western Russia ( GBIF Secretariat, 2023, BOLD 2/11/2023).

A. crocealis exhibits a single mitochondrial cluster on BOLD, BOLD:AAD7537 (2023-10-30). The mitogenome of the sequenced specimen (OX438878) is identical (658 bp) to the prevalent continental haplotype and a few other DNA barcodes from UK specimens are a single nucleotide different. Anania testacealis (Zeller, 1847) from the Mediterranean regions is around 1.2% divergent but belongs to the same BIN cluster; there is an intermediate sequence identified as A. crocealis DNA barcoded from Austria. Its closest relative otherwise is unclear; the nearest cluster on BOLD is BOLD:AAQ3746 (one specimen identified as Pyrausta trimaculalis) which is morphologically dissimilar and at least 5.26% divergent, but Anania perlucidalis (Hübner, [1809]), a species treated in Yang et al. (2012) is from 5.53% divergent. The type species of Anania Hübner, 1823 is Pyralis guttalis [Denis & Schiffermüller], 1775 ( Anania funebris). Although Pyralis crocealis Hübner, 1796 is the type species of Ebulea Doubleday 1849, several such genera were synonymised with Anania by Leraut (2005); see also Trankner et al. (2009). Anania exhibit an elongated, asymmetric sclerite of the phallus apodeme and female genitalia with a digitiform sclerotization inside the antrum ( Trankner et al., 2009). The genus Anania Hübner, 1823 is currently placed in the tribe Pyraustini ( Mally et al., 2019).

The genome data may be useful to investigate questions such as the closest relatives of A. crocealis, and adaptations to feed on Asteraceae: Inuleae.

The genome of the Ochreous Pearl, Anania crocealis, was sequenced as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project, a collaborative effort to sequence all named eukaryotic species in the Atlantic Archipelago of Britain and Ireland. Here we present a chromosomally complete genome sequence for Anania crocealis, based on one male specimen from Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory, England.

Genome sequence report

The genome was sequenced from one male Anania crocealis ( Figure 1) (see methods). A total of 47-fold coverage in Pacific Biosciences single-molecule HiFi long reads was generated. Primary assembly contigs were scaffolded with chromosome conformation Hi-C data. Manual assembly curation corrected 12 missing joins or mis-joins and removed one haplotypic duplications, reducing the scaffold number by 7.69%.

Figure 1. Photograph of the Anania crocealis (ilAnaCroc1) specimen used for genome sequencing.

The final assembly has a total length of 624.0 Mb in 35 sequence scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 22.9 Mb ( Table 1). The snailplot in Figure 2 provides a summary of the assembly statistics, while the distribution of assembly scaffolds on GC proportion and coverage is shown in Figure 3. The cumulative assembly plot in Figure 4 shows curves for subsets of scaffolds assigned to different phyla. Most (99.95%) of the assembly sequence was assigned to 29 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 28 autosomes and the Z sex chromosome. Chromosome Z was assigned by alignment to Eudonia lacustrata (GCA_947562085.1) ( Boyes et al., 2023). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data are named in order of size ( Figure 5; Table 2). While not fully phased, the assembly deposited is of one haplotype. Contigs corresponding to the second haplotype have also been deposited. The mitochondrial genome was also assembled and can be found as a contig within the multifasta file of the genome submission.

Genome annotation report

The Anania crocealis genome assembly (GCA_949315895.1) was annotated using the Ensembl rapid annotation pipeline ( Table 1; https://rapid.ensembl.org/Anania_crocealis_GCA_949315895.1/Info/Index). The resulting annotation includes 20,486 transcribed mRNAs from 20,293 protein-coding genes.

Methods

Sample acquisition and nucleic acid extraction

A male Anania crocealis (specimen ID NHMUK013698305, ToLID ilAnaCroc1) was collected by hand in Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory, England, UK (latitude 51.27, longitude 1.37) on 2021-09-24. The specimen was collected and identified by David Lees (Natural History Museum) and preserved by dry freezing at –80 °C.

The workflow for high molecular weight (HMW) DNA extraction at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI) includes a sequence of core procedures: sample preparation; sample homogenisation; DNA extraction; HMW DNA fragmentation; and fragmented DNA clean-up. The sample was prepared for DNA extraction at the WSI Tree of Life laboratory: the ilAnaCroc1 sample was weighed and dissected on dry ice with tissue set aside for Hi-C sequencing ( Jay et al., 2023). Tissue from the whole organism was disrupted using a Nippi Powermasher fitted with a BioMasher pestle ( Denton et al., 2023a). HMW DNA was extracted in the WSI Scientific Operations core using the Automated MagAttract v2 protocol ( Oatley et al., 2023). HMW DNA was sheared into an average fragment size of 12–20 kb in a Megaruptor 3 system with speed setting 31 ( Bates et al., 2023). Sheared DNA was purified by solid-phase reversible immobilisation ( Strickland et al., 2023): in brief, the method employs a 1.8X ratio of AMPure PB beads to sample to eliminate shorter fragments and concentrate the DNA. The concentration of the sheared and purified DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. Fragment size distribution was evaluated by running the sample on the FemtoPulse system.

RNA was extracted from abdomen tissue of ilAnaCroc1 using the Automated MagMax™ mirVana protocol ( do Amaral et al., 2023). The RNA concentration was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit RNA Broad-Range (BR) Assay kit. Analysis of the integrity of the RNA was done using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit and Eukaryotic Total RNA assay.

Protocols developed by the Tree of Life laboratory are publicly available on protocols.io ( Denton et al., 2023b).

Sequencing

Pacific Biosciences HiFi circular consensus DNA sequencing libraries were constructed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Poly(A) RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the NEB Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit. DNA and RNA sequencing was performed by the Scientific Operations core at the WSI on Pacific Biosciences SEQUEL II (HiFi) and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (RNA-Seq) instruments. Hi-C data were also generated from remaining head and thorax tissue of ilAnaCroc1 using the Arima2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Genome assembly, curation and evaluation

Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups ( Guan et al., 2020). The assembly was then scaffolded with Hi-C data ( Rao et al., 2014) using YaHS ( Zhou et al., 2023). The assembly was checked for contamination and corrected as described previously ( Howe et al., 2021). Manual curation was performed using HiGlass ( Kerpedjiev et al., 2018) and Pretext ( Harry, 2022). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi ( Uliano-Silva et al., 2023), which runs MitoFinder ( Allio et al., 2020) or MITOS ( Bernt et al., 2013) and uses these annotations to select the final mitochondrial contig and to ensure the general quality of the sequence.

A Hi-C map for the final assembly was produced using bwa-mem2 ( Vasimuddin et al., 2019) in the Cooler file format ( Abdennur & Mirny, 2020). To assess the assembly metrics, the k-mer completeness and QV consensus quality values were calculated in Merqury ( Rhie et al., 2020). This work was done using Nextflow ( Di Tommaso et al., 2017) DSL2 pipelines “sanger-tol/readmapping” ( Surana et al., 2023a) and “sanger-tol/genomenote” ( Surana et al., 2023b). The genome was analysed within the BlobToolKit environment ( Challis et al., 2020) and BUSCO scores ( Manni et al., 2021; Simão et al., 2015) were calculated.

Lees et al. present a genome assembly for the Ochreous Pearl, which appears to be of high quality and holds significant value for future research. Overall, the manuscript is well-prepared, but I have a few minor suggestions : Introduction: The introduction provides a thorough overview of the natural history of the Ochreous Pearl and the divergence observed in its COI sequences. This sets a strong foundation for the study. However, the mention of the BOLD should be clarified. What is BOLD? Please include relevant citations.

The manuscript mentions adaptations for feeding on Asteraceae: Inuleae, but it lacks specifics. Could the authors elaborate on the types of adaptations observed? Additionally, why is feeding on Inuleae noteworthy? 

Figure 4: Figure 4 indicates that some scaffolds lack hits. Have the authors investigated the reasons for these missing hits? Could these scaffolds be contaminations or do they represent uncharacterized sequences? Further exploration or discussion of these findings would be valuable.

Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?

Yes

Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?

Yes

Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?

Yes

Are the protocols appropriate and is the work technically sound?

Yes

The authors presented the chromosome level genome sequence of a male individual of the Ochreous Pearl ( Anania crocealis). The final assembly shows a total length of 624.0 Mb condensed in 35 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 22.9 Mb. Mitochondrial assembly is also sequenced and available. The 99.95% of the assembly sequence is distributed in 29 chromosomal-level scaffolds, representing 28 autosomes plus the Z chromosome. The BUSCO pipeline indicated a high completeness of the genome with 98.6% of complete genes found, additional descriptive analyses are indicated in Table 1. Genome annotation identified 20,293 protein-coding genes. Standard bioinformatic pipelines were performed and software versions are indicated in Table 3. This high-quality assembly is a valuable tool to understand questions related to the evolution and adaptation of this genus and about the Lepidoptera order.

While the methodological part and the data presented is robust, I would rephrase some parts of the introductory section, as sometimes can be a bit complicated to read:

-   In the background, sometimes it is written UK, United Kingdom, England. It is better to standarise and use one of the terms or write United Kingdom (UK) and then use UK.

  I would rephrase the entire the first and second paragraph as following:

The Ochreous Pearl,  Anania crocealis (Hübner, 1796), is a crambid moth, which boasts a wingspan measuring approximately 22–25 mm (Goater, 1986), with forewings spanning 11–12 mm (Sterling and Parsons, 2018). Its forewings display a pale yellow tone with minute reddish-brown orbicular and reniform stigmata, bounded by a convex basal transverse line and a distal transverse line that curves around the outer stigma. The hindwings are whitish-grey, with reddish-brown terminal lines in both wings. While resembling other Pyraustinae species found in the United Kingdom (UK), such as Paratalanta hyalinalis (Hübner, 1796) and the whiter Paracorsia repandalis ([Denis & Schiffermüller], 1775), the Ochreous Pearl differs in its unmarked hindwings. Like many pyraustines, it adopts a triangular resting posture.

Adult moths fly in the UK between late June to August ( Goater, 1986;  Parsons & Clancy, 2023), and It is considered as univoltine or occasionally bivoltine flying up to September or even November in the south of the UK ( Parsons & Clancy, 2023;  Sterling & Parsons, 2018). The adult moth is mainly nocturnal but easily spotted around the foodplant during the day.

  I will also correct the next sentences:

A. crocealis is more or less common and widespread in southern parts of the United Kingdom, occurring more locally in Ireland, Wales, northwest England and Scotland, where it is scarce, as well as the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands ( Parsons & Clancy, 2023).

- It was not specified if the RNA-seq reads were used for the annotation pipeline. It can clearly improve the quality of the annotation, so it is interesting to know if it was included.

Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?

Yes

Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?

Yes

Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?

Yes

Are the protocols appropriate and is the work technically sound?

Yes
