Salinity stress has a great impact on crop growth and productivity and is one of the major factors responsible for crop yield losses. The K-homologous (KH) family proteins play vital roles in regulating plant development and responding to abiotic stress in plants. However, the systematic characterization of the KH family in rice is still lacking. In this study, we performed genome-wide identification and functional analysis of KH family genes and identified a total of 31 KH genes in rice. According to the homologs of KH genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, we constructed a phylogenetic tree with 61 KH genes containing 31 KH genes in Oryza sativa and 30 KH genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and separated them into three major groups. In silico tissue expression analysis showed that the OsKH genes are constitutively expressed. The qRT-PCR results revealed that eight OsKH genes responded strongly to salt stresses, and OsKH12 exhibited the strongest decrease in expression level, which was selected for further study. We generated the Oskh12-knockout mutant via the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing method. Further stress treatment and biochemical assays confirmed that Oskh12 mutant was more salt-sensitive than Nip and the expression of several key salt-tolerant genes in Oskh12 was significantly reduced. Taken together, our results shed light on the understanding of the KH family and provide a theoretical basis for future abiotic stress studies in rice.

pmc1. Introduction

The K-homologous (KH) family proteins belong to DNA/RNA-binding proteins containing the conserved KH domain. The KH domain was first identified in human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) [1], which consists of approximately 70 amino acids that can be folded into two completely different ways, named type Ⅰ and type Ⅱ folding, respectively [2,3]. The KH family genes play important biological functions in animals. For example, HRPK-1, a KH domain protein, controls Caenorhabditis elegance development by affecting miRNA processing and enhancing miRNA/miRISC gene regulatory activity [4]. KHSPR (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) provided a potential link with human diseases [5]. SAM68 (also known as KH-domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal-transduction-associated 1 (KHDRBS1)) plays vital roles in human cancers including lung adenocarcinoma [6], hepatic gluconeogenesis [7], and breast cancer [8].

In addition to their important functions in animals, KH family genes also play an important role in plants, which have been shown to participate in plant growth, development, and hormone-related processes, and adapt to environmental stresses. Several members of the KH family were reported to be involved in flowering time. For instance, FLK, GRP7, GRP8, KHZ1, and KHZ2 function as flowering promoters, while PEPPER, FLY, and HEN4 function as flowering suppressors in Arabidopsis thaliana [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. In rice, SPIN1, a KH protein ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11, delays flowering independently of day length [17]. Recent studies have shown that AtKH9 (At2g38610) and AtKH29 (At5g56140) can respond to abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) in Arabidopsis thaliana [18]. ABA plays an important role in plant adaptation to abiotic stress. KH proteins are involved in the process of abiotic stress in plants. KH domain protein REGULATOR OF CBF GENE EXPRESSION 3 (RCF3) negatively regulates heat stress by impacting the expression of heat stress factors in Arabidopsis thaliana [19]. HOS5 (High Osmotic Stress Gene Expression 5) and AtSIEK (stress-induced protein with EXD1-like domain and KH domain) are both K homology (KH)-domain RNA-binding proteins that interact with FRY2/CPL1 whose mutants exhibit both ABA and salt-sensitive phenotypes [20,21,22,23]. The KH family genes have been widely identified and studied in Arabidopsis. However, the functional analysis of the KH family genes in rice was seldom reported.

Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important crops in the world, and salinity stress is rated as one of the major abiotic stresses [24]. Soil saline–alkalization is a major abiotic stressor on the world’s agriculture, causing considerable damage to crop growth and resulting in serious losses in crop production [25,26,27]. The salt overly sensitive (SOS) signaling pathway plays a central role in exporting Na+ from the cytosol to the apoplast and conferring salt tolerance in plants [28,29,30,31,32]. Moreover, the salt tolerance of plants is also regulated by hormones such as ABA. ABA, as a signal molecule, regulates salt tolerance by mediating the expression of salt stress genes. Many genes regulating salt stress tolerance in rice have been identified. SOS1, AKT1, NHX2, HKT2;1, and SKC1(HKT1;5) are key regulators that positively modulate rice salt tolerance by maintaining homeostasis of K+/Na+ [29,33]. The core of ABA regulating plant salt tolerance is the activation and transcriptional regulation of SnRK2 protein kinase on multiple downstream target genes, thereby directly or indirectly regulating plant salt tolerance [34,35]. For example, the rice zinc finger protein OsbZIP23, containing ABRE elements in the promoter region, increases the susceptibility to salt and ABA in rice [36]. GmSIN1 (SALT INDUCED NAC1) is induced by ABA and promotes root growth and salt tolerance in Glycine max, and the GmSIN1 transcription factor directly binds to the SIN1BM element on the promoters of salt tolerance genes, thereby regulating the response to salt stress [37]. Despite numerous genes that have been identified regulating salt stress in rice, the function of KH family genes in responding to salt stress remains unknown.

In this study, we systematically performed genome-wide identification and analysis of the KH family genes in rice, which bridges the research gap for KH gene family studies in rice. A total of 31 KH genes were identified, which were uniformly distributed in 12 chromosomes. The phylogeny and evolutionary relationships, conserved motifs, gene expression, and cis-element of KH family genes were comprehensively performed. The gene expression profiling revealed that all OsKH genes are constitutively expressed in various rice tissues. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expressions of OsKH1, OsKH10, OsKH12, OsKH13, OsKH18, OsKH27, and OsKH29 are significantly affected under salt stress. To elucidate the function of OsKH12 in salt responses, with the highest decrease in expression level, we generated the Oskh12 CRISPR knockout mutant. Further molecular experiments confirmed that Oskh12 decreased tolerance to salt stress and the expression of several key salt-tolerant genes in Oskh12 was significantly reduced, indicating that the Oskh12 mutant was more salt-sensitive than Nip. In conclusion, this study systematically analyzed the response of the KH family genes in response to salt stress in rice for the first time and provided new genetic resources for rice breeding.

2. Results

2.1. Identification and Chromosomal Location of KH Family Genes in Rice

To identify the KH family members in rice, the CDSs of KH genes in rice were downloaded from the Phytozome website (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/, accessed on 4 January 2024). A total of 31 KH family genes were finally screened and identified in rice. To understand the distribution characteristics of OsKH genes on chromosomes, the chromosomal locations of OsKH genes were analyzed by TBtools and results revealed that the 31 OsKH genes, not the gene clusters, were distributed on almost all twelve chromosomes, except for chromosome 11, and chromosome 1 has the most OsKH genes with seven (Figure 1A). These KH genes were named according to their position on the chromosome, in the order of OsKH1 to OsKH31. Gene duplication analysis predicted five OsKH gene pairs in the rice genome, making a total of ten duplicated genes, including OsKH6/OsKH19, OsKH7/OsKH18, OsKH9/OsKH21, OsKH15/OsKH31, and OsKH16/OsKH22 (Figure 1B). The duplication of rice KH genes was analyzed by the Advanced Circos of TBtools software v2.096. Amino acid sequence alignment showed that the KH domain of these genes has the highest similarity (Figure S1). These results demonstrated that several KH genes may appear in the course of gene duplication, and the segmental duplication events may be responsible for the expansion of KH genes in rice.

To explore the potential functions of the KH family genes, the CDSs of identified KH genes were downloaded from the Tair website (https://www.arabidopsis.org/, accessed on 4 January 2024). The comprehensive information of 31 OsKH genes and 30 AtKH genes was analyzed and is summarized in Table 1, including the number of amino acids, molecular weight (MW), theoretical PI, instability index, aliphatic index, the grand average of hydropathicity, and the subcellular location. These protein characteristics were analyzed through the Protein Paramter Calc of TBtools software v2.096 and the protein subcellular localization prediction of KH family proteins was analyzed by the PSORT website (https://wolfpsort.hgc.jp/, accessed on 4 January 2024). Among them, AtKH30 encoded the largest protein, containing 866 amino acids, while OsKH3 encoded the smallest protein, consisting of 133 amino acids. The protein molecular weight (MW) and isoelectric point (PI) of these proteins range from 14.7 (OsKH3) to 94.7 kDa (AtKH30), and 4.16 (AtKH5) to 10.07 (OsKH3), respectively. According to the analysis of the grand average of hydropathicity, the KH family proteins are generally hydrophilic (Table 1). To analyze subcellular localization, all KH proteins were predicted by the PSORT website. The results showed that most KH proteins (50.82%) are located in the nucleus, which is consistent with the localization characteristics of the RNA-binding protein. In addition, 24.6% of proteins are located in the cytoplasm, 14.75% of proteins are likely to be located in the chloroplast, and small partial proteins are separately located in the mitochondria (AtKH7 and OsKH2), cytoskeleton (OsKH5 and OsKH12), and peroxisome (AtKH5), which implies that the KH proteins may also play a function in chloroplast or mitochondria (Table 1).

2.2. Phylogenetic and Synteny Analysis of KH Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa

To investigate the genetic phylogenetic relationship of the KH family genes, the protein sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana (30 members) and Oryza sativa (31 members) were downloaded from the Phytozome website (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/, accessed on 4 January 2024) and the Tair website (https://www.arabidopsis.org/, accessed on 4 January 2024), respectively, and were used to construct phylogenetic trees by MEGA7 using the neighbor-joining method. According to the phylogenetic tree, the 61 KH genes were classified into three groups: Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3. Group 1 consisted of the largest number of KH members, with 28 genes, followed by Group 2 with 23 genes, while Group 3 had the smallest with only 10 genes. Group 1 contained 13 and 15 KH genes in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively; Group 2 contained 12 and 11 KH genes in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively; and Group 3 contained 6 and 4 KH genes in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively (Figure 2A). Interestingly, the ratio of OsKH to AtKH in each group was almost 1:1, indicating that the KH family genes are conserved between the two species.

To further analyze the evolutionary relationship between KH genes of rice and Arabidopsis, we performed a comparative synteny analysis between Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa using the Dual Systeny Plot of TBtools software v2.096 (Figure 2B). There was a linear relationship in five pairs of genes, including AtKH3/OsKH25, AtKH9/OsKH6, AtKH11/OsKH6, AtKH11/OsKH19, and AtKH29/OsKH11, between the two species. The coding sequences of the five gene pairs are 850 to 2290 bp (Figure 2B and Table 1). This finding indicated that the KH genes were highly conserved in evolutionary terms.

2.3. Conserved Motif and Domain Analysis of the KH Family Proteins

To explore the potential functions of KH family proteins in detail, the conserved motif and domain of 61 KH proteins were analyzed using the MEME website (Figure 3). A total of 10 conserved motifs were identified and the detail motifs are shown in Figure S2. Notably, the three groups had significantly different compositions of motifs. The proteins of Group 1 contains ten motifs and has the largest number of motifs, and almost all genes in Group 1 contain motif 2, motif 5, motif 6, and motif 7. However, Group 2 mainly contained three motifs and most members of Group 3 contained two motifs (Figure 3A). Interestingly, motif 1 was found in almost all KH proteins in rice and Arabidopsis, while motif 3 and motif 4 were only found in the KH proteins of Group 2.

Conserved domain information was calculated by Batch CD-Search on the NCBI website and then visualized by the Gene Structure View of TBtools software v2.096. Conserved domain analysis revealed that nine domains exist in the KH family and the KH domain was found in entire KH members. In addition, Group 1 members contain the most KH domains, from two to five, and Group 2 members mainly contain both one KH domain and one other domain, such as STAR, ZnF_C3H1, and zf-CCCH (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the members of Group 3 included the KH domains, and most of them had only one KH domain (Figure 3B).

2.4. Tissues Expression Analysis of KH Members in Oryza sativa

The tissue-specific expression patterns of genes reflect their action sites and mechanisms. To analyze the expression profiles of KH genes in different tissues of rice, we screened the expression levels of OsKH genes in 12 rice tissues, including leaf blade, leaf sheath, root, stem, inflorescence, anther, pistil, lemma, palea, ovary, embryo, and endosperm, which were downloaded from the rice public database of RiceXPro (https://ricexpro.dna.affrc.go.jp/, accessed on 6 January 2024) and then visualized by the HeatMap of TBtools software v2.096. According to the expression results, KH genes showed slight differences in tissue expression. In general, most of the OsKH genes such as OsKH4, OsKH9, OsKH12, OsKH13, and OsKH25 are constitutively expressed in these twelve tissues in rice. However, there are also a small number of OsKH genes that are not constitutively expressed. For example, the expressions of OsKH23 in inflorescence, anther, and pistil are significantly higher than other tissues of the twelve tissues (Figure 4). Specifically, OsKH4, OsKH9, OsKH10, OsKH12, OsKH13, and OsKH25 were evolutionarily close and had high expression levels in all rice tissues. On the contrary, OsKH23, OsKH26, OsKH27, and OsKH28 showed low expression levels in the twelve tissues of rice (Figure 4). These results show that the genes that are more evolutionarily closely related have similar expression patterns. In brief, these data indicated that the KH genes may play a key role in the formation and development of different tissues with varied expression levels in rice.

2.5. Cis-Acting Element Analysis of KH Gene Promoters

To explore the potential functions of KH family genes, the 2000 bp upstream sequences of 61 KH genes in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana were extracted from the NCBI website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed on 6 January 2024) to analyze the potential cis-elements using the PlantCARE (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/, accessed on 6 January 2024) website and visualized by the Basic Biosequence View of TBtools software v2.096. The promoter regions of KH genes were analyzed (Figure 5), and six main responsive elements were identified, related to ABA (abscisic acid), GA (gibberellin), drought stress, endosperm, meristem, and light responsiveness. Among them, GA and endosperm expression elements are specific to the KH genes of Oryza sativa in these two species, while drought-inducibility and meristem expression elements are unique to the KH genes of Arabidopsis thaliana compared to rice (Figure 5A). In rice, there are 9 ABA responsiveness elements, 18 GA-responsive elements, and 5 endosperm expression elements (Figure 5B). In Arabidopsis thaliana, there are 45 ABA responsiveness elements, 20 drought-inducibility elements, 10 meristem expression elements, 137 light responsiveness elements, and no GA-responsive and endosperm expression elements (Figure 5C). These results suggest that KH family genes are involved in plant growth and development, and play an important role in plant response to hormone and abiotic stress response.

2.6. Expression Pattern Analysis of OsKHs under Salt Stress and ABA Treatment

Cis-acting element analysis of KH genes showed that the KH family genes mainly responded to light and ABA, and the ABA signal was closely related to salt stress. So, the response function of the KH genes to salt stress was mainly studied. To study the possible function of OsKHs in response to salt stress, the transcript level of 31 OsKH genes under the treatment of 300 mM NaCl was analyzed by qRT-PCR. After treatment with 300 mM NaCl for 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h, the seedlings were collected for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis. The expression analysis shows that the relative expression levels of OsKH genes in the leaf are more consistent with the tissue expression pattern. The expressions of OsKH4 and OsKH13 in rice leaves are relatively higher, which is consistent with the data in the database of Figure 4. Furthermore, the expressions of OsKH23 and OsKH28 in rice leaves were so low that they could not be detected by qRT-PCR, which further illustrates the authenticity of our quantitative results (Figure 6). The results found that the eight KH genes were strongly repressed from 3 h to 12 h, including OsKH1, OsKH7, OsKH10, OsKH12, OsKH13, OsKH18, OsKH27, and OsKH29. Among these genes, OsKH12 exhibited the strongest decrease in expression level. Three KH genes, OsKH2, OsKH8, and OsKH16 were significantly upregulated at 6 h (Figure 6). Following ABA treatment, the expressions of OsKH5, OsKH13, OsKH20, OsKH27, and OsKH30 were considerably down-regulated at all three time points (Figure 7). Primers used in this assay are listed in Table S1. These findings indicated these genes are possibly related to salt or ABA signaling pathways.

2.7. The Oskh12-Knockout Mutant Decreased Tolerance to Salt Stress in Rice

The expression pattern of KH genes under salt stress showed that OsKH12 responded to salt stress to a large extent, which could be used as a representative of the KH gene family in rice. To elucidate the function of KH genes in response to salt stress, the expression of OsKH12, which was significantly reduced under the treatment of NaCl, was selected to be knocked out in rice using a CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing approach. Two-week rice seedlings of Nip and homozygous Oskh12 mutant were treated with 150 mM NaCl. The phenotype showed that the Oskh12 mutant exhibited earlier wilted phenotypes and a lower survival rate than Nip (Figure 8A,B). These data confirmed that Oskh12 was more salt-sensitive than Nip. In addition, ROS levels can reflect the extent of damage to the plant. Under salt stress, the damage degree of plants with strong salt tolerance will be lower. ROS staining by NBT displayed that the ROS level of Oskh12 was significantly higher than Nip, which is consistent with the sensitive phenotype of Oskh12. The ROS level of Oskh12 increased to a greater extent than Nip under the 300 mM NaCl treatment compared to the control (Figure 8C,D). These results illustrated that the tolerance of salt stress was decreased in Oskh12.

To investigate the effect of OsKH12 on salt-related genes, the nine key salt-responsive genes (LEA3, DREB1A, SKC1, HKT2;1, AKT1, iSAP8, NHX2, SOS2, and DSR2) were selected for expression analysis under the treatment of NaCl. The expression of LEA3, DREB1A, SKC1, HKT2;1, AKT1, iSAP8, NHX2, SOS2, and DSR2 were all induced by salt stress [38,39]. Overexpression of iSAP8 and DSR2 can enhance the tolerance to salt and drought in rice [40,41]. Also, DREB1A has been discovered to enhance salt tolerance both in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana [42]. SKC1, HKT2;1, AKT1, NHX2, and SOS2 were induced by salt stress in rice [43,44,45,46]. The qRT-PCR results showed that, under the treatment of 300 mM NaCl, the expression of LEA3, DREB1A, SKC1, HKT2;1, and iSAP8 was significantly down-regulated in Oskh12 compared to Nip, which was consistent with the phenotype of Oskh12 under the treatment of NaCl (Figure 9). For instance, the expression level of LEA3 was significantly increased in both Nip and Oskh12 under salt treatment conditions. However, the upregulation of LEA3 was markedly lower in Oskh12 compared to Nip (Figure 9). The expression level of SKC1 was significantly upregulated after salt treatment in Nip; in contrast, the expression level of SKC1 did not show a significant change in Oskh12 under salt treatment (Figure 9). Another four genes, including AKT1, NHX2, SOS2, and DSR2 showed no significant differences in expression levels in Oskh12 (Figure 9). Primers used in this assay are listed in Table S2. These results further confirmed that OsKH12 participates in the regulation of salt response and regulates the salt stress response of plants by regulating the expression of salt-responsive genes.

2.8. OsKH12 Is Related to the Proteins Containing the RRM Domain

To further identify the involvement of OsKH12 in the salt stress response, we predicted the proteins to which OsKH12 may bind by the STRING website (https://cn.string-db.org/, accessed on 11 January 2024). The predictions showed the three proteins that OsKH12 was most likely to bind to in rice and the gene IDs encoding these three proteins are Os07g0138700, Os02g0122800, and Os01g0866600 in rice (Figure 10). Among the three proteins, two proteins contain the RRM domain, which is the main RNA-binding domain involved in pre-mRNA splicing (Figure 10).

3. Discussion

The K-homologous (KH) protein is a type of nucleic acid-binding protein containing the KH domain, which plays an important role in the development and abiotic stress response [1,19,47,48]. However, systematic characterization and functions of the KH family in rice are still absent. In this study, we performed genome-wide identification of KH family genes in rice and Arabidopsis, and a total of 31 and 30 KH genes were identified, respectively (Figure 1). The comprehensive information was further analyzed including duplication analysis, protein sequence length, MW and pI, instability index, aliphatic index, grand average of hydropathicity, and subcellular localization. The phylogenetic and synteny analysis indicated that the evolution of KH gene families in the two plants was relatively conservative (Figure 2). We also performed conserved domain analysis of KH proteins and tissue expression of KH family genes to explore the potential function of the KH family, which revealed that all KH proteins contain the KH domain and the OsKH genes expressed in all rice tissues (Figure 3 and Figure 4).

To investigate the potential function of OsKHs in response to salt stress, the expression level of 31 OsKH genes under salt and ABA stress was analyzed by qRT-PCR. We found several key genes that showed obvious changes in response to abiotic stress (Figure 6 and Figure 7). According to the results of qRT-PCR, OsKH12 was selected to investigate the function in response to salt stress including the phenotype analysis and expression of salt-responsive marker genes in Oskh12-crispr mutant. Our results confirmed that OsKH12 participates in the regulation of salt response by regulating the expression of salt-responsive genes (Figure 8 and Figure 9). The salt tolerance phenotypes of KH genes were also reported in other plants, such as AtSIEK [23] and FRY2/CPL1 [21,49]. Moreover, in response to abiotic stress, KH genes also play vital roles in the regulation of plant growth and development. HEN4 containing the KH domain delays flowering time by upregulation of the FLC and MAF4, which are the MADS-box repressor genes in Arabidopsis thaliana [50]. SPIN1 delays the heading date by downregulating the flowering promoter gene Hd3a (Heading date 3a) in short days and by targeting Hd1-independent factors in long days in Oryza sativa [17]. These findings provide clues that the OsKH genes may be involved in the regulation of plant growth and development, such as heading date in rice.

According to the protein properties of KH family proteins, KH proteins function as nucleic acid-binding proteins and mainly regulate various physiological processes by regulating the expression of other genes through post-transcriptional regulation. The KH proteins do not directly regulate the physiological phenotype of plants. To predict the partner proteins of the KH family, we analyzed the possible interaction proteins of OsKH12 and found that the OsKH12 protein is likely to interact with proteins containing the RRM domain (Figure 10). The RRM domain is a type of RNA-binding protein, like the KH domain. There is a study that shows that the plant-specific splicing factor OsRS33 (Os02g0122800) plays a crucial role during plant responses to abiotic stresses including salt stress [51]. Consequently, it is reasonable to speculate that KH proteins can interact with many RNA-binding proteins to regulate abiotic stress response through pre-mRNA splicing in plants. The underlying molecular mechanism of KH proteins regulating physiological processes has great value for future research. In summary, these results suggested that OsKH12 plays an important role in response to salt stress, which explains the significance of the KH genes for salt stress. Our study may provide better help to understand the source and function of KH family genes.

4.2. Chromosomal Location and Duplication Analysis of KH Genes in Oryza sativa

To identify chromosomal locations, TBtools software v2.096 (https://github.com/CJChen/TBtools, accessed on 4 January 2024) was used to map KH genes on 12 chromosomes in Oryza sativa based on gene annotation information [55]. The data source is based on the Ensembl Plants database [52]. To further analyze gene replication, duplicated events were analyzed using the Advanced Circos of TBtools software v2.096.

4.3. Phylogenetic Tree and Collinearity Analysis of KH Proteins

To investigate the evolutionary relationship between Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana, the protein sequences of KH members were compared using the ClustalW program. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA7 using the neighbor-joining method. Tree nodes were evaluated through 1000 repeated bootstrap analyses. The final phylogenetic trees were modified using ITOL (https://itol.embl.de/, accessed on 5 January 2024) [56]. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa were selected to analyze the collinearity of the KH family using the multicollinearity scan toolkit.in TBtools.

4.4. Conserved Motif and Domain Analysis of KH Family Proteins

The conserved motif of the full-length KH proteins was analyzed using the online MEME website (https://meme-suite.org/meme/, accessed on 5 January 2024) [57] by the zero or one occurrence per sequence (zoops) strategy and set the number of searchable motifs to 10. Conserved domain information of KH proteins was calculated by Batch CD-Search (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/bwrpsb/bwrpsb.cgi, accessed on 5 January 2024) [58].

4.5. Expression Pattern Analysis of KH Genes in Oryza sativa

The normalized signal intensity data of KH genes in different tissues were downloaded from RiceXPro (https://ricexpro.dna.affrc.go.jp/, accessed on 6 January 2024) [59] to reveal the expression patterns of all KH family genes in Oryza sativa. Differential expression analysis and the heatmap were visualized using TBtools.

4.6. Cis-Regulatory Elements Analysis of KH Gene Promoters

The promoter sequences (2000 bp upstream of KH genes) of the Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa were downloaded from the NCBI website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed on 6 January 2024). These promoter sequences were used to predict cis-acting elements by the public website PlantCARE (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/, accessed on 6 January 2024) [60].

4.7. Plant Materials and Methods of Stress Treatment

The Nipponbare was used for rice transformation to construct the Oskh12 CRISPR mutant. The Oskh12 mutant and Nip were used to analyze the responses to abiotic stresses in rice. Rice plants were grown at 32 ± 2 °C, in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog culture medium (MS), under LDs (long day, 14 h light/10 h dark). Two-week-old seedlings of rice were separately processed with 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM NaCl, and 50 µM ABA in 1/2 MS medium. For qRT-PCR analysis, the acute treatment method was adopted, with 300 mM NaCl and 50 µM ABA, and the treatment time was 24 h. Moreover, the phenotypic material was treated chronically, with 150 mM NaCl, and the treatment time was 3 days. After observing the phenotype, the seedlings were then collected for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis.

4.8. RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR Analysis

The leaves of two-week seedlings were used for the extraction of total RNA. The total RNA was extracted using the RNA-easy Isolation Reagent (Vazyme) and then synthesized cDNA with Evo M-MLV RT Mix Kit (Accurate Biology). qRT-PCR analyses were performed in the CFX384 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green Premix Pro Taq HS qPCR Kit (Accurate Biology). The Oryza sativa Ubiquitin (UBQ) gene was used as an internal control. Primers used in this assay are listed in Tables S1 and S2.

4.9. ROS Staining

ROS level was measured by nitro tetrazolium blue chloride (NBT). The higher the ROS level, the darker the color and the larger the area of the NBT stain. One-week-old seedlings of Nip and Oskh12 were treated in 300 mM NaCl for 16 h before the seedling staining. The seedlings were incubated in 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.6) containing 1 mg/mL NBT (HWRK CHEM) for one hour at room temperature for dark staining and then destained in 95% ethanol. The root tips were then photographed using a light microscope.
