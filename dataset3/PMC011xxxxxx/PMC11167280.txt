The family Karschiidae Kraepelin, 1899, comprising four genera and 45 species, is a small family within Solifugae, with a palearctic distribution in north Africa, the Middle East, and central Asia (WSC 2024). Among the four genera within Karschiidae, Barrus Simon, 1880, is a monotypic genus; Barrussus Roewer, 1928, comprises three species, Eusimonia Kraepelin, 1899, comprises 15 species; and Karschia Walter, 1899, comprises 26 species (WSC 2024).

The genus Karschia is divided into two subgenera: the nominative subgenus, Karschia Walter, 1889, found in North Africa, the Middle East, and central Asia, comprising 18 species; and the subgenus Rhinokarschia Birula, 1935, found in central Asia, comprising eight species. Five Karschia species have been recorded from China, one Rhinokarschia species, Karschia (Rhinokarschia) rhinoceros Birula, 1922 (♂♀, Xinjiang), and four Karschia species, Karschia (Karschia) birulae Roewer, 1934 (♂♀, Xinjiang), Karschia (Karschia) tarimina Roewer, 1933 (♀, Xinjiang), Karschia (Karschia) tienschanica Roewer, 1933 (♀, Xinjiang) and Karschia (Karschia) tibetana Hirst, 1907 (♂♀, Xizang) (Harvey 2003). Additionally, Lawrence (1954) described Karschia (Karschia) nubigena, collected by Dr. Noel Humphreys, a medical officer in the British Mount Everest expedition of 1936; the World Solifugae Catalog (WSC) and Harvey’s catalog mention the type locality as Mount Everest, Nepal (Harvey 2003; WSC 2024), but the route followed by that expedition suggests it was more likely collected from the Xizang side (Ruttledge et al. 1936). Based on this, it is believed that Karschia (Karschia) nubigena also occurs in Xizang.

The genus Karschia sets itself apart from other genera within Karschiidae easily by possessing a rotatable, long, and rolled flagellum, often described as sessile (Birula 1922, 1938; Bird et al. 2015). This flagellum maintains a core resemblance to a plumose seta, typically adorned with a delicate fringe of setae, which Lawrence (1954) mistakenly referred to as “cilia”. The flagellum of Karschia is understood to comprise three components: a distinct stalk, a basal peg sharing similarities with the base of a whip-like flagellum, and an elongated filiform structure resembling a shaft, thus resembling a composite flagellum (Bird et al. 2015). Roewer (1934) described the flagellum of Karschia as an elongated double-walled tubular structure, originating from a seta that widened along its length. The margins of the flagellum rolled inward until they nearly formed a closed canal, suggesting a process of longitudinal in-furling. However, it is possible that the hypothesized double membrane was lost. Consequently, the flagellum of Karschia resembles a composite flagellum, with identifiable components such as a “stalk”, “base”, and “shaft”, though its sessile nature awaits further investigation (Bird et al. 2015).

The flagellar complex of Karschia comprises several structures: a long, typically coiled, filiform flagellum; plumose setae, located ventrally to the flagellum and modified to varying degrees, including broadening referred to as flagellar complex plumose (fcp) setae; and one or two acuminate subspiniform setae, usually swollen at the base and situated dorsoproximal to the flagellar attachment point, labeled as flagellar complex subspiniform (fcs) setae (Gromov 2004; Bird et al. 2015).

Males of Karschia lack spiniform setae on the anterior edge of the propeltidium (on both sides of the ocular tubercle) (Gromov 1998, 2004). Females of this genus exhibit differences, notably in the morphology of the more modified genital segment. The subgenus Karschia differs from the subgenus Rhinokarschia by the absence of a hornlike process on the fixed finger of the chelicerae in males (though a low crest may be present instead), and by the presence of transverse, oval, or triangular-shaped genital sternites in females, which cover the genital opening (Gromov 2004).

The systematics and phylogenetic relationships of Karschia remain poorly understood, as its congeners are relatively local and rare species (Gromov 2004). Species diagnoses in this genus are mainly based on male characters. Female descriptions are limited to body size and coloration, chelicerae dentition, and the shape and number of ctenidia on the fourth abdominal segment. The female genital segment has previously been considered of little or no taxonomic significance in species diagnosis (Roewer 1933; Birula 1938). This makes it difficult to identify female specimens. In order to address the issues related to female identification, Gromov (2004) proposed that for female diagnosis, the shape and size of the ctenidia on the fourth abdominal segment, as well as the shape, size, and relative arrangement of the sclerites of the genital segment are more reliable than others, i.e., the chelicerae dentition, the number of ctenidia on the fourth abdominal segment, the body size and coloration.

Xizang Autonomous Region, located in the southwestern part of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and known as the “Roof of the World,” has an average elevation exceeding 4,000 meters. The high altitude and unique geographical location form its distinctive climate and rich biodiversity, including many rare and endangered species. Xizang has become a hotspot and crucial area for global biodiversity research in recent years. However, research on Solifugae in Xizang has been limited, with only four species previously reported: Galeodescaspius Birula, 1890, Karschiatibetana Hirst, 1907, KarschianubigenaLawrence 1954, and Triditarsustibetanus Roewer, 1933.

During our biodiversity survey, we revealed a widespread distribution of Solifugae in Xizang. During the process of identifying collected specimens, we observed a high level of diversity within the genus Karschia in Xizang through comparison with diagnoses, descriptions, and drawings in original literature of all known species. This research used morphological characters and molecular data to investigate the taxonomy of Solifugae in Xizang. To solve the problem of male and female combinations and to ensure the precision of our morphological identifications, we carried out genetic distance comparisons on suspected new species. For each species, both a male and a female specimen were chosen to extract genomic DNA and the COI gene was amplified. In conclusion, comparisons of morphological characteristics and molecular genetic distances have led us to conclude that there are seven species of Karschia distributed in Xizang.

From the study of the newly collected material, we provide a redescription of Karschia (Karschia) tibetana Hirst, 1907 based on males and females collected from the type locality, and the description of five new species: Karschia (Karschia) dingye sp. nov., Karschia (Karschia) lhasa sp. nov., Karschia (Karschia) zhui sp. nov., Karschia (Karschia) shigatse sp. nov., and Karschia (Karschia) namling sp. nov.

﻿Materials and methods

The specimens were collected during the day by hand from under stones, and preserved in 75% and 95% alcohol, respectively. Photographs were taken using a Leica M205A stereomicroscope equipped with a DFC 550 CCD and an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a Kuy Nice CCD camera and were imported into Helicon Focus v. 7 for stacking. Plates and photographs were edited and retouched using Adobe Photoshop 2022. Drawings was made using the Inkscape software (v. 1.0.2.0). All measurements are in mm. Pedipalp measurements are shown as: total length (femur, tibia, metatarsus, tarsus); leg measurements are shown as: total length (femur, tibia, metatarsus, tarsus, claw). All specimens are deposited in the Museum of Hebei University (MHBU), Baoding, China.

Descriptions follow the format of Birula (1938), with some modifications by Gromov (2004). The terminology used for identifying teeth and other structures in the chelicerae follows Bird et al. (2015). Identification of individual teeth used Bird et al.’s criteria (2015) for primary homology assessment of dentition. The term ‘ctenidia’ stands for long, single-tipped (non-bifid) and flexible setiform structures present on some opisthosomal sternites.

The QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) was used to extract genomic DNA from the muscle tissues of the legs for one male and one female of each species. The PCR primer for a partial fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit (COI) gene is the universal primer for invertebrate DNA barcoding LCO1490 and HCO2198 (Folmer et al. 1994). All sequences were analyzed using BLAST and are deposited in GenBank (Table 1). Sequence alignment was performed in MAFFT v. 7.313. The p-distance of intra-specific nucleotide divergence was calculated in MEGA.11.0.

﻿Results of genetic analyses

In this study, genomic DNA was extracted from one male and one female of each species, and genetic distances were analyzed. The intraspecific genetic distance ranged from 0% to 2.20%, while the interspecific genetic distance varied from 8.08% (between K.shigatse sp. nov. (female) and K.dingye sp. nov. (male)) to 12.92% (K.shigatse sp. nov. (male) and K.lhasa sp. nov. (male)) (Table 2). The average genetic distance ranged from 0% to 7.92% within Galeodescaspius Birula, 1890 (Maddahi et. al 2016). Therefore, based on significant morphological differences and genetic distance, we conclude that the six species in this study can be distinguished effectively.

Diagnosis.

K.tibetana differs from all Karschia species except K.nubigena, K.dingye sp. nov., K.lhasa sp. nov., K.zhui sp. nov., K.shigatse sp. nov. and K.namling sp. nov. by male cheliceral movable finger with MSM teeth. K.tibetana differs from K.nubigena by having fringed flagellum (Fig. 11A) and male ctenidia in sternite IV cylindrical and not wide at bottom (Fig. 19C), from K.dingye sp. nov., K.lhasa sp. nov. and K.zhui sp. nov. by pedipalpal metatarsus without or with only a few papillae (Fig. 16B), and from K.shigatse sp. nov. and K.namling sp. nov. by flagellum without lateral apophysis and long fcp (Fig. 11A). The female genital operculum is easily recognizable in all known species; it is long, subtriangular, and with no clear demarcation between the plates, with the rear edge being lightly chitinized (Fig. 17A).

Remark.

In the original description, K.tibetana flagellum was described as smooth with small lateral apophysis (Hirst 1907). However, upon re-examination by Hirst (1912), it was found that the flagellum did not have a small lateral apophysis. Roewer (1933) reexamined the holotype and confirmed that the flagellum is fringed, not smooth. Based on my examination of specimens collected from the type locality, the flagellum of K.tibetana is fringed, and without small lateral apophysis. Based on the comparison of genetic distances, with a genetic distance of 0.88% (Table 2) between male and female collected from same locations, we believe that they are same species.

Patronym honors Prof. Ming-Sheng Zhu (Hebei University), who significantly contributed to arachnological studies in China.

Diagnosis.

Karschiazhui sp. nov. differs from all Karschia species except K.lhasa sp. nov. by cheliceral fixed finger mucron having dorsal crest (Figs 9F, 11D). K.zhui sp. nov. differs from K.lhasa sp. nov. by cheliceral fixed finger mucron dorsal crest small crescent-shaped (Figs 9F, 11D), and pedipalp having less spines and thin papillae (Fig. 16H). Female genital operculum like K.tibetana, but can be diagnosed by the lower edge, which is somewhat convex, not flat (Fig. 17D).

﻿Discussion

The cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene has been extensively employed in taxonomic and differentiation studies of Arachnida species. Analysis of COI sequences enables researchers to deepen their understanding of genetic variances among various species, thus facilitating more precise delineation and differentiation (Maddahi et. al. 2016).

The rich diversity of Karschia in Xizang can be ascribed to its distinctive geographical environment and climate conditions. With an average elevation surpassing 4000 meters, Xizang features vast high-altitude lakes and intricate geographical terrain, which hinder species dispersal, resulting in geographic isolation. Furthermore, we documented the highest Solifugae record (K.shigatse sp. nov.) in the Old World, complete with precise geographic coordinates, at an elevation of 4605.8 meters.

After examining various taxonomic characteristics of solifuge species and comparative specimens in this research, we think cheliceral teeth possess some taxonomic value, particularly regarding the relative size between the primary teeth of the median teeth series, which remains constant: the fondal series typically exhibit variability, and the numbers of secondary teeth generally have poor taxonomic value unless a specific type of tooth is entirely missing. Body size and coloration are subject to variation, with the opisthosoma being relatively soft and its size susceptible to change based on the nutritional state of the specimen; coloration can fluctuate with environmental changes, indicating that these traits have limited taxonomic value. The numbers of ctenidia on the sternite and spines of the male pedipalp also display variation, albeit to a lesser extent, making them suitable as additional diagnostic characters; however, the shape and size of ctenidia on the sternite are relatively constant, rendering them reliable taxonomic characteristics. The study confirms the significance of the female genital operculum in classification, as the shape, size, and relative arrangement of the genital operculum remain consistent among female individuals of the same species; the flagellar complex of the male serves as reliable diagnostic characteristics, particularly regarding the degree of modification of the fcp (flagellar complex process plumose setae), the shape and number of fcs (flagellar complex subspiniform to spiniform setae), and the lateral apophysis.

Reevaluating the taxonomy of numerous Karschiidae species is indeed crucial and urgent. Historically, their classification and diagnostic criteria have heavily leaned on the cheliceral teeth traits of only a limited number of female specimens (Birula 1922, 1938; Roewer 1933, 1934). However, this approach may not fully capture the diversity and variation present within these species. Therefore, a more comprehensive assessment that considers a broader range of taxonomic characters, including those mentioned earlier such as the shape and numbers of ctenidia on the sternite and the shape and size of the genital operculum in females, is necessary. By incorporating these additional diagnostic characteristics, we can better elucidate the taxonomy and improve our understanding of the intricate relationships among Karschia species.
