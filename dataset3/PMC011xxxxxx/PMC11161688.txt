The formicine ant genus Paraparatrechina was originally described by Donisthorpe (1947) as a subgenus of Paratrechina Motschoulsky, 1863, with Pa. (Paraparatrechina) pallida (Donisthorpe, 1947) as type species by monotypy. Later, Brown (1973) treated Paraparatrechina as a provisional junior synonym of Paratrechina, and Trager (1984) confirmed this synonymy, citing the lack of monophyly of the subgenus based on a morphological assessment. However, LaPolla et al. (2010a) redefined Paratrechina as a monotypic genus with Pa.longicornis (Latreille, 1802) based on a phylogenetic analysis of the Prenolepis genus-group. That study also recovered Paraparatrechina as a valid monophyletic genus, distinguishable from its sister taxa by the uniform, erect setal pattern on the mesosoma. Currently, the Prenolepis genus-group comprises the genera Euprenolepis Emery, 1906, Nylanderia Emery, 1906, Paraparatrechina, Paratrechina, Prenolepis Mayr, 1861, and Pseudolasius Emery, 1887 (LaPolla et al. 2010a).

Paraparatrechina are generally small ants, measuring 1–2 mm long, and they are typically found in the Afrotropical, Australasian, Indomalayan, Oceanian, and Palearctic biogeographic regions (LaPolla et al. 2010b; AntWeb 2023a). The genus can be easily distinguished from other formicine ant genera by a unique mesosomal setal pattern, which includes two pairs of erect pronotal setae, one pair of mesonotal setae, and one pair of propodeal setae (LaPolla et al. 2010a). The genus is often confused with Nylanderia. However, Nylanderia lacks a pair of erect propodeal setae and has six mandibular teeth instead of five (LaPolla et al. 2010b).

Paraparatrechina is present in various tropical environments, ranging from rainforests to forest clearings, and can be found in a wide spectrum of habitats, ranging from leaf litter on the ground to high up in the canopy (LaPolla et al. 2010b). Afrotropical species, for example P.weissi (Santschi, 1910) and P.bufona (Wheeler, 1922), are the only known polymorphic species of Paraparatrechina, displaying several morphological characteristics indicative of a hypogaeic lifestyle (LaPolla et al. 2010a).

Currently, Paraparatrechina encompasses 38 valid species and four valid subspecies (Bolton 2023). The Indomalayan biogeographic region has 14 known species, while P.aseta (Forel, 1902) is the only known species in the Indian subcontinent until now (Bharti and Wachkoo 2014). This species has been reported in several states of India, including Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, Nagaland, and West Bengal (Bharti et al. 2016; Janicki et al. 2016; Guénard et al. 2017). In this study, we describe and illustrate P.neela sp. nov., which was discovered in the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas of India. This find comes 121 years after the discovery of the only previously known Indian species, P.aseta.

During the period of colonial rule in India, a scientific expedition to document the natural history and geography of the Siang Valley of the Eastern Himalayas accompanied a punitive military expedition against the indigenous people there in 1911–12 (Army Intelligence Branch 1911). Originally known as the Abor Expedition, the findings of the expedition were published in several volumes from 1912 to 1922 in the Records of the Indian Museum. Now, a century later, a team of researchers has been engaged in a series of expeditions under the banner “Siang Expedition”, funded by the National Geographic Society through the wildlife-conservation expedition grant (NGS-71945c-20), to resurvey the biodiversity of the region. In May 2022, among several other ant species from various genera, we collected two worker specimens of P.neela sp. nov. from Yingku village, in East Siang District of Arunachal Pradesh, northeastern India. This remarkable new species represents the first documented occurrence of the genus in Arunachal Pradesh and only the second Paraparatrechina species known from the Indian subcontinent.

﻿Materials and methods

Two worker specimens belonging to Paraparatrechina were collected from a secondary forest at an elevation of 803 m in Yingku village, which is located in East Siang District of Arunachal Pradesh, northeastern India (Fig. 1). East Siang District is encompassed between latitudes 27°43'N to 29°20'N and longitudes 94°42'E to 95°35'E and has an area of 4005 km2. It has tropical and humid-subtropical climate, with temperatures of 18–28 °C and an average annual rainfall of 4168 mm (Yumnam et al. 2013; Yogesh Kumar et al. 2022). These specimens were collected from debris in a hole in a tree trunk 3 m above the ground. We used an aspirator to extract the specimens and preserved them in absolute alcohol. The specimens were point mounted and examined under a Zeiss SteREO Discover.V8 microscope.

The identifications of the specimens were made by referring to available taxonomic keys by LaPolla et al. (2010a, 2010b) and comparing them with images of the types of all known Paraparatrechina species, except for P.bufona, P.kongming (Terayama, 2009), P.nana (Santschi, 1928), P.sakuya Terayama, 2013, P.sordida (Santschi, 1914), and P.tapinomoides (Forel, 1905), which are not available on AntWeb (2023a). We checked original descriptions and available illustrations for specimens that did not have type images. The unique metallic-blue coloration of the body, in combination with the head shape, sculpture and pubescence patterns, helped us to confirm the status of new species. Stacked focus montage images of the new species were captured at 200× magnification using a Keyence VHX 6000 digital microscope. Final figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop v. 25. The map was prepared using ArcGIS v. 10.4.1 (ArcGIS 2023). The holotype and paratype specimens are deposited in ATREE Insect Museum, Bangalore, India (AIMB). Body measurements are in millimeters and were taken with AxioVision v. 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and recorded with two decimal places. Body measurements and indices (Fig. 2) follow LaPolla and Fisher (2014).

﻿Key to Paraparatrechina species of the Indian subcontinent based on the worker caste

We recognize the uncertainty in the taxonomy of Indomalayan Paraparatrechina, as some species do not have the typical characteristics of the genus, and for this reason, we have not provided a key to the Indomalayan species. A comprehensive revision is necessary before reliable taxonomic key to the Indomalayan Paraparatrechina can be made.

The Indian subcontinent has only two species of Paraparatrechina, P.aseta and P.neela sp. nov. See the worker description of P.neela for a detailed comparison with P.aseta.

Mesosoma. Compact in lateral view, pronotum convex with short dorsal face in lateral view (Figs 3C, 4B). Mesonotum sloping towards metanotum, propleura and mesopleura demarcated by a distinct promesonotal suture; mesopleura and metapleura demarcated by indistinct metanotal groove; propodeum raised, propodeal dorsal face short, angular, with a long declivitous face; propodeal spiracle distinct (Fig. 3C).

Metasoma. Petiole length 0.05 mm, strongly compressed antero-posteriorly. Gaster with 5 tergites, anterior margin concave and forming sharp edges in dorsal view (Figs 3B, 4D). Acidopore distinct apically (Fig. 3C).

Sculpture. Body covered with fine punctures; mandibles with longitudinal striations (Fig. 4A); clypeus, mesopleura, and propodeal declivity smooth and shiny (Fig. 4A–C).

Pilosity. Short, decumbent pubescence covers most of the body. Distinctly paired dark setae present from anterior clypeal margin to propodeum; 8 pairs on head from posterior region to clypeus; 2 pairs on pronotum, 2 pairs on mesonotum, 1 pair on propodeum (Figs 3C, 4B). Setae shorter on head posterior to eyes and gaster and longer on anterior of head and mesosoma.

Color. Body largely iridescent blue, with a purple tinge and white pubescence; legs and antennae brown at base, dark to yellowish brown at middle, white at the tip; mandible yellowish brown. Gaster blue in anterior region, brown towards posterior end.

Etymology.

The specific epithet neela is a noun in apposition, signifying the color blue in most Indian languages. It is used to describe the unique blue or sapphire color of this species.

Species comparison.

Paraparatrechinaneela sp. nov. is easily distinguishable from all known species of Paraparatrechina by its metallic-blue body. It can be separated from P.aseta, the only other known species from the Indian subcontinent (Fig. 5A–C) by the following characteristics: 1) body largely metallic blue, except antennae, mandibles, and legs in P.neela (body uniformly light brown in P.aseta); 2) in full-face view, head subtriangular with strongly convex lateral margin in P.neela (head subrectangular with gently convex lateral margin in P.aseta); 3) anterior clypeal margin convex in P.neela (anterior clypeal margin medially concave in P.aseta); 4) mandible with five teeth in the masticatory margin in P.neela (mandible with six teeth in P.aseta); 5) propodeal dorsal face in lateral view raised in P.neela (propodeal dorsal margin flat and continuous with rest of mesosoma in P.aseta). Paraparatrechinaneela is similar to P.buttelibryanti (Forel, 1916), another Indomalayan species (Wheeler 1919), in body size, eye length, antennal scape surpassing occipital margin, and a raised propodeal dorsal face with a long declivitous face. However, P.neela can be easily separated from P.buttelibryanti by the following characteristics: 1) body largely metallic blue in P.neela (body castaneous brown; head, thorax, and gaster with metallic reflections in P.buttelibryanti); 2) legs with thick appressed pubescence in P.neela (legs with sparse pubescence in P.buttelibryanti); 3) overall body opaque with fine punctures in P.neela (thorax and gaster distinctly shagreened in P.buttelibryanti); 4) head subtriangular, longer than wide in P.neela (head subrectangular, as long as wide in P.buttelibryanti).

﻿Discussion

Paraparatrechina is a relatively underexplored genus but with an expected species diversity much higher than what is currently known (LaPolla et al. 2010b; LaPolla and Fisher 2014). Previous studies indicate that the Prenolepis genus-group, which includes Paraparatrechina, originated and diversified during the late Paleocene and Eocene, between 45 and 60 mya (Blaimer et al. 2015; Matos-Maraví et al. 2018). Blaimer et al. (2015) estimated ancestral crown age of the genus ranges from 26.8 to 31.4 Ma. Similarly, the estimated crown age of a clade within Paraparatrechina is 23.5 Ma (Matos-Maraví et al. 2018). Matos-Maraví et al. (2018) suggested that the Prenolepis genus-group most likely originated in continental Southeast Asia. It points to the possibility of dispersal and colonization of this group from Southeast Asia to India. Further explorations are imperative to unravel the influence of the Himalayas and the Western Ghats on this group’s evolution and dispersal.

Paraparatrechina species are typically found at elevations below 800 m, although a few inhabit elevations around 1500 m (AntWeb 2023a). However, a few species, such as P.minutula (Forel, 1901) and P.kongming (Terayama, 2009), are known to occupy higher elevations above 2000 m (2300 m and 2500 m, respectively). Paraparatrechinaneela sp. nov. was collected from an elevation of 803 m. This species showcases a unique metallic blue coloration not observed in any other species within this genus. However, some Paraparatrechina species do exhibit color reflections or iridescence, like P.iridescens (Donisthorpe, 1942).

Blue coloration in animals, except in marine sponges, is a relatively rare phenomenon. However, there are several blue species of vertebrates, like fish, frogs, and birds, as well as invertebrates, such as spiders (Bagnara et al. 2007; Doucet and Meadows 2009; Umbers 2013; Chomphuphuang et al. 2023). While blue coloration is common among many insects, particularly in hymenopterans such as Apoidea, Chrysididae and Ichneumonidae, it is very rare in Formicidae. Blue colour in insects is usually produced by the arrangement of biological photonic nanostructures rather than pigments, and it has independently evolved in various groups (Prum 1999; Seago et al. 2009; Hsiung et al. 2015; Chomphuphuang et al. 2023). This vibrant feature raises intriguing questions. Does it help in communication, camouflage, or other ecological interactions? Delving into the evolution of this conspicuous coloration and its connections to elevation and the biology of P.neela presents an exciting avenue for research.
