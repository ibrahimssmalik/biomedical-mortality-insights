﻿Abstract

Panus is a typical wood-rotting fungi, which plays considerable roles in ecosystems and has significant economic value. The genus Panus currently consists of more than 100 species; however, only eight species have been reported from China. This study aims to distinguish and describe two novel species from the Panussimilis complex, namely Panusminisporus and Panusbaishanzuensis, one new record species from Zhejiang Province, Panussimilis and three common species, Panusconchatus, Panusneostrigosus and Panusrudis, based on detailed morphological and phylogenetic studies, relying on Chinese specimens. Panusminisporus is characterised by its reddish-brown pileus, decurrent lamellae with cross-veins, slender stipe, smaller basidiospores, wider generative hyphae and absence of sclerocystidia. Panusbaishanzuensis is featured by its pileus with concentric and darker ring zone, decurrent lamellae with cross-veins, shorter stipe, longer basidiospores, diverse and shorter cheilocystidia and smaller sclerocystidia. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU) and translation elongation factor 1-α gene (tef-1α) were employed to perform a thorough phylogenetic analysis for genus Panus and related genera, using Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood analysis. The results indicate that Panusminisporus and Panusbaishanzuensis form two independent clades within the Panussimilis complex themselves. Detailed descriptions, taxonomic notes, illustrations etc. were provided. In addition, a key to the reported species of Panus from China is also provided.

The genus Panus Fr. is one of the wood-rotting fungi with significant economic and ecological value. Its taxonomic history has been carried out for a long time. In 1787, Bulliard (1786) described a new species Agaricusconchatus Bull (≡Panusconchatus (Bull.) Fr.). When the genus Panus was established, it was designated as the type species (Fries 1838). From then on, a large number of new taxa were described around the world (Berkeley and Broome 1883; Stevenson 1964; Senthilarasu 2015; Tibpromma et al. 2017). Till now, there are currently described 113 taxa of Panus, including 101 species, 10 varieties, and two metamorphs, according to Index Fungorum (http://www.indexfungorum.org). However, these species were mainly reported from Europe and North America, rarely described from Asia.

The taxonomic status between Panus and allies was often disputed, leading to confusion amongst these genera. The key characteristics to separate the genus Lentinus Fr. and Panus were hugely different in the history research, thus, leading to indistinct boundaries between these genera. Hymenophoral trama structures were adopted by Singer (1961a, 1961b, 1962) and Kühner (1980) to separate Panus and Lentinus. However, Pegler (1971, 1975) and Corner (1981) employed the hyphal systems as the key features to separate these two genera. These led to confusing and unstable taxonomic systems. Later, hyphal systems were proved to be the more reasonable key characteristics in distinguishing these species (Kibby et al. 1978; Corner 1981; Singer 1986) and treated Lentinus and Panus as distinctly separate genera. However, Pegler (1983) disagreed that Panus was an independent genus and treated it as a subgenus of Lentinus. That also led to mutual confusion between the Panus and Lentinus species. With the application of phylogenetic analysis in researching these groups, the view held by Corner (1981) was confirmed; furthermore, this group was divided into three separate genera, viz. Lentinus, Panus and Neolentinus Redhead & Ginns (Hibbett and Vilgalys 1991; Thorn et al. 2000). Meanwhile, the family status of Panus has been changed several times and it has been placed in Agaricaceae, Polyporaceae, Tricholomataceae and Meruliaceae (Fries 1838; Imai 1938; Singer 1961a, 1961b, 1962; Miller 1972; Douanla-Meli and Langer 2010; Zmitrovich and Kovalenko 2016). However, in recent years, the taxonomic status of Panus has been significantly changed again, due to phylogenetic studies and it has been upgraded to a separate family rank, Panaceae (Justo et al. 2017).

Now, genus Panus could be clearly distinguished from the genus Lentinus because of its skeletal hyphae (Corner 1981; Pegler 1983). However, Panus is not easy to distinguish from the genus Pleurotus (Fr.) P. Kumm. It is well known that the fungi of the genus Pleurotus have unique nematode-feeding properties (Li and Bau 2014). Its softer texture, on the other hand, was once thought to be a monomitic hyphal system with only generative hyphae. In contrast, the fungi of Panus have a firmer texture with a typical dimitic hyphal system, which can be distinguished from Pleurotus. However, as research continued, many species in the genus Panus were found to have nematode-predatory functions, which corresponded precisely to the characteristics of Pleurotus and, thus, a large number of species were moved into Pleurotus, such as Pleurotusgiganteus (Berk.) Karun. & K.D. Hyde and Pleurotustuber-regium (Fr.) Singer (Singer 1951; Klomklung et al. 2012). Yet these species that have migrated into Pleurotus have the same dimitic hyphal system as Panus, which is quite different from the commonly known characteristics of Pleurotus. This has led to a blurring of the line between Panus and Pleurotus, making it difficult to distinguish.

In addition, there are some species similar in appearance, for example, Lentinusciliatus Lév., Lentinussimilis Berk. & Broome and Lentinushookerianus Berk. etc. These belonged to the sect. Velutini sensu Pegler and shared a similar appearance, because of its velutinate to strigose basidiomes and thick-walled skeletocystidia (Pegler 1983). However, later, four of them were recombined into Panus, due to the presence of skeletal hyphae and phylogenetic studies, leaving L.velutinus and L.fasciatus behind (Pegler 1983; May and Wood 1995), but these two species also show close affinity with genus Panus (Pegler 1983; Douanla-Meli and Langer 2010; Luangharn et al. 2019).

Due to the omission of the taxonomic studies, the species diversity of Panus is still unclear in China and lacks systematic research. Teng (1963) described three Panus species, viz. Panustorulosus (Pers.) Fr. (≡P.conchatus), Panusrudis Fr. and Panussetiger (Lév.) Teng in his book—Fungi of China. Later, Tai (1979) recorded four species, P.conchatus, P.rudis, P.setiger and Panustigrinus (Bull.) Singer (≡Lentinustigrinus (Bull.) Fr.), in “Sylloge Fungorum Sinicorum”. Subsequently, the species diversity of Panus has been performed locally in China (Li et al. 1978; Du et al. 1983; Xu et al. 1986; Li and Qin 1991; Li et al. 2004; Shao and Xiang 2006). In 2014, the first monograph about pleurotoid and lentinoid fungi in China was published, in which 11 species of Panus were recorded (Li and Bau 2014). Then, “the Atlas of Chinese Macrofungal Resources” described six species (Li et al. 2015).

Therefore, up to now, there are only a total of eight Panus species that have been recorded from China, viz. Panusciliatus (Lév.) T.W. May & A.E. Wood, P.conchatus, Panusneostrigosus Drechsler-Santos & Wartchow, P.rudis, P.setiger, Panussimilis (Berk. & Broome) T.W. May & A.E. Wood, Panusstrigellus (Berk.) Chardón & Toro and Panusvelutinus (Fr.) Sacc. (≡L.velutinus). In addition, most of them are located in southwest China, northwest China, south China, central China and Northeast China. Panus resources in east China and north China are in urgent need of development, especially in previously undocumented areas such as Zhejiang Province.

In this study, a combined morphological and phylogenetic study of six Panus species from China is carried out. Two new species, Panusminisporus and Panusbaishanzuensis and a new record, P.similis, from Zhejiang Province are described in detail, along with illustrations and colour photographs.

﻿Materials and methods

﻿Sampling and morphological studies

All examined specimens in this study were collected from China. The pictures of fruit-body were taken in the field. After measuring and describing the fresh macroscopic characteristics, the specimens were dried at 40–50 °C in a dryer, then they were stored in the Fungarium of Jilin Agricultural University (FJAU).

Macroscopic characteristics were based on the field notes and the colours were described according to Küppers (2002). The descriptions of size were referred to Yue et al. (2023). Then microscopic characteristics were observed from the dried specimens using a Zeiss Axio lab. A1 light microscope. The dried specimens were rehydrated in 94% ethanol first, then mounted in 3% potassium hydroxide (KOH) to observe the colour, sealed in 1% Congo red to measure the data and Melzer’s reagent was used to check if the spores were amyloid or dextrinoid (Hu et al. 2022a, b). As to each specimen, at least 40 values were measured separately from different basidiomata for each feature. The measurements are given as (a)b–c(d), the range of b–c contains a minimum of 90% of the measured values and the extreme values (i.e. a and d) are given in parentheses. The extent for basidiospores is given as length × width (L × W), Q values equal to the ratio of length and width of each basidiospore in the side view, “n” represents the number of measured basidiospores, “lm” represents the arithmetic mean of the length, “wm” represents the arithmetic mean of the width and “q” represents the average Q value of all basidiospores ± standard deviation.

﻿DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing

The total DNA was extracted using the new plant genomic DNA extraction kit from Jiangsu Kangwei Century Biotechnology Company Limited, following the instructions. Primer pairs ITS1-F/ITS4-B (Gardes and Bruns 1993), LR0R/LR5 (Cubeta et al. 1991) and 983F/2212R (Rehner and Buckley 2005) were used for amplifying and sequencing these sequences: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU) and translation elongation factor 1-α gene (tef-1α), respectively. The amplification reactions were carried out in a total 25 μl system, which is as follows: dd H2O 13.5 μl, 2 × Es Taq MasterMix (Dye) 8 μl, 10 mM of each primer 1 μl and DNA solution 1.5 μl. The PCR reaction procedures were as follows: for ITS, 1) 95 °C for 2 min to initial denaturation, 2) 35 cycles of denaturation for 40 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 50 °C and extension for 2 min at 75 °C, 3) leave at 75 °C for 10 min (Zmitrovich and Kovalenko 2016); for nLSU, 1) 95 °C for 3 min to initial denaturation, 2) 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 45 s at 47 °C and extension for 1 min and 30 s at 72 °C, 3) leave at 72 °C for 10 min (Hu et al. 2022b); and for tef-1α, 1) 95 °C for 2 min to initial denaturation, 2) 9 cycles of denaturation for 40 s at 95 °C, annealing for 40 s at 60 °C and extension for 2 min at 70 °C, 3) then 36 cycles of denaturation for 45 s at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min and 30 s at 50 °C and extension for 2 min at 70 °C, 4) leave at 70 °C for 10 min (Zmitrovich and Kovalenko 2016). The PCR products were detected by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis, then Comate Bioscience (Jilin) Company Limited was employed to carry out purification and sequencing. Finally, the sequencing results were uploaded to GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), Table 1.

﻿Data analysis

By searching in GenBank, 68 ITS sequences, 46 nLSU sequences and 23 tef-1α sequences of related taxa were downloaded. A total of 10 ITS sequences, 10 nLSU sequences and three tef-1α sequences were newly obtained in this study. All sequences used in this paper are listed in Table 1. Each single-gene dataset was aligned in MAFFT 7 using the E-INS-i strategy (Katoh and Standley 2013) and manually adjusted where necessary in BioEdit 7.0.9 (Hall 1999). The datasets (ITS+nLSU+tef-1α) were then concatenated using PhyloSuite 1.2.3 (Zhang et al. 2020; Xiang et al. 2023) for multi-phylogenetic analyses. ModelFinder 2.2.0 (Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017) was used to select the best-fit partition model (Edge-linked).

The datasets were analysed separately using Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI). For the ML analysis, it was performed using IQ-Tree 1.6.12 (Schmidt et al. 2014). The tree topology was verified under both 1000 bootstrap and 1000 replicates of the SH-aLRT branch test. For the BI analysis, it was performed using MrBayes 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al. 2012). The analysis employed a general time-reversible DNA substitution model and a gamma distribution to account for rate variation across the sites. Four Markov chains were executed for two runs, starting from random trees, the chains being terminated when the split deviation frequency value fell below 0.01. Tree samples were sampled every 1000 generations. The first 25% of the sampled trees were discarded as burn-in, while the remaining trees were used to construct a 50% majority consensus tree and to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities (BIPP). Then the phylogenetic trees were visualised using FigTree 1.4.3 (Andrew 2016).

﻿Results

﻿Phylogenetic analyses

Three gene fragments (ITS, nLSU and tef-1α) from representative species of five orders in the Agaricomycetes were selected to construct a phylogenetic analysis, which included 71 species belonging to 31 genera of 19 families. The aims are to explore the phylogenetic status within Panus and its relationship with allies. A total of 160 sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis in this study. The best-fit model is GTR+F+I+G4, TIM3+F+I+G4, TPM3+TNe+I for ITS, nLSU and tef-1α datasets, respectively. The topologies of ML and BI, based on the concatenated datasets, were consistent and typically increased support values; thus, only the result inferred from ML analysis was displayed (Fig. 1).

In the phylogenetic tree, four clades corresponding to Agaricales, Boletales, Polyporales and Gloeophyllales were revealed, with Hymenochaetales as outgroup (Fig. 1). As indicated in the tree, four families were selected as representatives of Agaricales. It is worth noting that Pleurotus is divided into two deeply-divergent clades. One represents the monomitic hyphal system species and the other is the dimitic hyphal system species (Fig. 1). Boletales is located between Agaricales and Polyporales. In the Polyporales clade, a total of seven families were selected to reconstruct the phylogenetic analysis, with the family Panaceae as the main group (Fig. 1). Amongst them, the genus Panus is divided into three clades, viz. clade A, clade B and P.similis complex clade. Thirty-one specimens we sampled formed two new species, Panusminisporus L. Yue, J.J. Hu, B. Zhang & Y. Li, sp. nov. and Panusbaishanzuensis L. Yue, B. Zhang & Y. Li, sp. nov., one new record species from Zhejiang Province, P.similis and three common species, P.conchatus, P.neostrigosus and P.rudis, which were clustered in Panus. Further morphological research of other related species was consistent with supporting the classification of these two new species. Additionally, the order Gloeophyllales is located between the orders Polyporales and Hymenochaetales (Fig. 1).

Notes.

This species is characterised by the reddish-brown pileus and stipe, white or dirty white lamellae with cross-veins and two tiers of lamellulae, slender stipe, smaller basidiospores and absence of sclerocystidia.

Panusminisporus is close to P.velutinus and P.similis in morphology, because of the velutinate pileus and slender stipe. However, the pileus and stipe of P.minisporus are both reddish-brown, which is different from the pale greyish-cinnamon to rufous or tawny-brown tints of P.velutinus and the cinnamon-brown to dark chestnut-brown, with violaceous or purplish tints of P.similis. Meanwhile, the lamellae of P.minisporus are white or dirty white, with cross-veins and two tiers of lamellulae, but the lamellae of P.velutinus and P.similis have no cross-veins and with 3 or 4 and 5 tiers of lamellulae, respectively. In addition, the pseudosclerotium of P.minisporus is absent, but P.velutinus and P.similis often have distinct pseudosclerotium. In terms of micromorphology, P.minisporus has smaller spores and Q values, wider generative hyphae and absent sclerocystidia, all of which can be distinguished from P.velutinus and P.similis.

Notes.

This species is characterised by the concentric darker zones pileus, decurrent lamellae with cross-veins, shorter stipe, longer basidiospores, diverse and shorter cheilocystidia and smaller sclerocystidia.

Panusbaishanzuensis is close to P.similis and P.velutinus in morphology, because of the similar pileus and lamellae. However, the pileus of P.velutinus and P.similis without concentric darker zones distinguished them from P.baishanzuensis. Meanwhile, the stipe of P.baishanzuensis is extremely short, while the stipe of P.velutinus and P.similis is long and slender. In addition, the lamellae of P.baishanzuensis have cross-veins with six tiers of lamellulae, but P.velutinus and P.similis have no cross-veins and with three or four and five tiers of lamellulae. At the same time, P.velutinus and P.similis both have pseudosclerotia, while the pseudosclerotium of P.baishanzuensis is absent. Lastly and most importantly, P.baishanzuensis has longer basidiospores, graeter Q values, shorter cheilocystidia and smaller sclerocystidia than P.similis and P.velutinus.

Notes.

This species was originally described by Berkeley and Broome (1873) as Lentinussimilis Berk. & Broome, then it was treated as Panusfulvusvar.similis (Berk. & Broome) Corner (Corner 1981). However, Pegler (1983) disagreed with Corner and still accepted it as a member of Lentinus. Until 1995, it was first raised to a species rank as P.similis (May and Wood 1995).

Based on morphological research, there are some differences between our collected specimen and the original description.

Our specimen has distinct plicate-sulcate similar to the original description; however, its pseudosclerotium is smaller, whereas the original is very large. In addition, its hyphae structure is the same as that of the original description, but its spores are larger and its cheilocystidia are smaller compared to the latter.

Before this study, this species was not recorded from Zhejiang Province, China; thus it is the first report of P.similis from Zhejiang Province.

Notes.

Panus is typified as this species and is widely distributed worldwide. It is recorded from Hainan, Hunan, Inner Mongolia etc. from China (Li and Bau 2014).

The appearance of this species is varied. The stipe is easily influenced by the environment, from short to long. Additionally, when aged, due to the appearance of skeletal hyphae, it becomes tough from the soft flesh.

Notes.

This species is one of the most widely distributed in the genus Panus, which was originally described as Lentinusstrigosus Fr. (Fries 1825) in North Carolina, USA and was transferred to Panus by Drechsler-Santos et al. (2012). Due to its densely villous to hispid-strigose pileus, this species is often confused with P.similis complex. However, it can be distinguished from the complex by its metuloids.

Notes.

This species is extremely similar to P.neostrigosus in appearance and has been treated as the same species (e.g. Pegler 1983; Li and Bau 2014; Li et al. 2015; Vargas-Isla et al. 2015). However, in our conception, these two species should be considered as two independent species. Panusrudis differed from P.neostrigosus in morphology by shorter metuloids and wider cheilocystidia. Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis results also support this conclusion.

﻿Discussion

In this study, 31 specimens of Panus from China were carefully examined. Through the combination of morphological and phylogenetic studies, two new species, P.minisporus and P.baishanzuensis and one new record from Zhejiang Province, China, viz. P.similis, have been discovered and described in detail, which increased the species diversity of Panus and expanded the distribution range of P.similis. According to Pegler, species belonging to P.similis complex were usually found near the Equator in Africa, South America, Australasia and Southeast Asia etc. (Pegler 1983). Additionally, there are also a few records in south China and southwest China (Li and Bau 2014). In contrast, P.baishanzuensis is located in east China, which greatly increases the distribution range of species in the P.similis complex.

There are quite a few species that are confusing and extremely similar in appearance. Species belonging to sect. Velutini sensu Pegler, such as L.ciliatus, L.similis, L.hookerianus, L.tephroleucus, L.velutinus and L.fasciatus belong to the Lentinus at first, because of their velutinate to strigose basidiomes and thick-walled skeletocystidia (Pegler 1983). However, with the changes in genus conceptions (Corner 1981; May and Wood 1995) and the consistency of phylogenetic and ontogenic studies (Hibbett and Vilgalys 1991; Hibbett et al. 1993), as a result, four species were combined as Panus, viz. P.ciliatus, P.similis, Panushookerianus (Berk.) T.W. May & A.E. Wood and Panustephroleucus (Mont.) T.W. May & A.E. Wood, which have a dimitic hyphal system consisting of thick-walled skeletal hyphae and generative hyphae (May and Wood 1995) and leaving L.velutinus and L.fasciatus within Lentinus. According to phylogenetic analysis, L.fasciatus and P.ciliatus are clustered with P.rudis and far away from L.velutinus (Douanla-Meli and Langer 2010), which is also consistent with the morphological characters. In the light of Douanla-Meli and Langer (2010), species of the P.similis complex usually have slender stipe (which can be up to twice as long as the diameter of the pileus). At the same time, the stipes of L.fasciatus and P.ciliatus are only sometimes slender, but usually short and stocky, which coincides with the stipe characteristics of P.rudis (Pegler 1983; Douanla-Meli and Langer 2010; Li and Bau 2014). Similar results were also obtained in this study.

Furthermore, some species within this complex were full of arguments. Lentinusvelutinus was proposed by Fries (1830); later, it was combined into P.velutinus (Fries 1838). Meanwhile, Berkeley (1843) described a new species, Lentinusfulvus Berk. Then, Pegler and Rayner (1969) transferred L.fulvus into Panusfulvus (Berk.) Pegler & R.W. Rayner. Afterwards, Corner described three varieties of P.fulvus from Malaysia, based on the pileus structure and dense lamellae (Corner 1981), which, together with P.velutinus, were rehabilitated by Pegler (1983) as L.velutinus. However, according to morphological studies (Pegler 1972, 1983; Corner 1981), L.velutinus does not have the skeleto-ligative hyphae typical of Lentinus, but has the skeletal hyphae typical of Panus, which coincides with the phylogenetic analysis (Douanla-Meli and Langer 2010; Luangharn et al. 2019). Thus, L.velutinus is more closely related to Panus than to Lentinus. Lentinusfasciatus was another controversial species; it was treated as a member of Panus in Singer and Pegler’s conception (Singer 1962; Pegler 1965). Later, the combination was rejected by Pegler (1983). However, the presence of skeletal hyphae and phylogenetic studies indicate a close genetic relationship with Panus (Pegler 1983; Douanla-Meli and Langer 2010).

In addition, some taxonomic problems exist in researching Panus. Firstly, synonyms led to confusion in species identification, such as P.ciliatus sensu May & Wood and Panusbrunneipes Corner. According to the description given by Corner (1981) for P.brunneipes and Pegler (1983) for P.ciliatus (= L.ciliatus), all these collections refer to the same species. However, based on the legitimate name, both names are accepted by Index Fungorum (http://www.indexfungorum.org) at the same time. However, the epithet ‘ciliatus’ is retained as the oldest one and has priority over ‘brunneipes’. Secondly, the boundary between Pleurotus and Panus needs to be refined. Species belonging to Panus are known to have a dimitic hyphal system with skeletal hyphae (Corner 1981; Pegler 1983). However, Panusgiganteus (Berk.) Corner and Panustuber-regium (Fr.) Corner, which also have skeletal hyphal, were transferred into Pleurotus (Singer 1951; Karunarathna et al. 2012). Phylogenetic analysis, based on ITS fragments, showed that they are closely related to species of Pleurotussubg.Coremiopleurotus (Klomklung et al. 2012; Karunarathna et al. 2016). It is worth mentioning that almost all of them have skeletal hyphae. Based on phylogenetic analyses (Stajic et al. 2005; Menolli et al. 2014; Shnyreva and Shnyreva 2015), species of the monomitic hyphal system and species of the dimitic hyphal system were clustered into a single unit, respectively. Obviously, these species are intermediate between Panus and the monomitic hyphal system species in Pleurotus (Fig. 1). Perhaps these species are attributed to a new genus-level unit that could serve as a boundary to distinguish between Panus and the remaining monomitic hyphal system species in Pleurotus. Thirdly, some species were always problematic for identification, for example, P.neostrigosus and P.rudis (Li and Bau 2014; Li et al. 2015). There are obvious differences between these two species. The metuloids of P.neostrigosus project up to 35 μm longer than P.rudis and the width of cheilocystidia is thinner than the latter. Thus, it is possible to distinguish these confusing species by combing the two characteristics (Pegler 1983; Douanla-Meli and Langer 2010; Li and Bau 2014; Luangharn et al. 2019). In addition, P.neostrigosus is clearly separate from P.rudis through phylogenetic analysis (Douanla-Meli and Langer 2010; Luangharn et al. 2019). Last, but not least, taxonomic research of the genus Panus is not evenly developed in China. The taxonomic research relating to Panus is mainly focused on northeast, southwest and south China. Additionally, the resources of Panus are waiting to be employed, especially in east and northwest China.

To address these issues, a more comprehensive study of Panus species that integrates morphological and systematic approaches to elucidate the relationships between different species is necessary. Reviewing the type specimens of every species in Panus is an essential task. At the same time, more gene fragments need to be obtained to construct more objective phylogenetic trees. With these preliminary preparations, the evolutionary relationship between the Chinese Panus data and the world’s species will be the subject of the next study.
