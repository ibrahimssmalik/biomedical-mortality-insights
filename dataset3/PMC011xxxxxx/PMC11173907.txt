With the rapid development of terahertz radar technology, the electromagnetic device for terahertz radar cross-section (RCS) reduction is worth investigating. However, the existing research concentrates on the RCS reduction metasurface with fixed performance working in the microwave band. This paper proposes a terahertz dynamic coding metasurface integrated with vanadium dioxide (VO2) for dual-polarized, dual-band, and wide-angle RCS reduction. The simulation result indicates that by switching the state of the VO2 between insulator and metal, the metasurface can realize the effective RCS reduction at 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz and 0.21 THz to 0.39 THz under the left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized incident waves. When the polar and azimuth angles of the incident wave vary from 0° to 40° and 0° to 360° respectively, this metasurface can maintain a 10 dB RCS reduction. This work has potential value in the terahertz stealth field.

The terahertz (THz) frequency band generally means 0.1 to 10 THz. Terahertz radar has attracted considerable attention recently for high resolution, small aperture, all-day, Doppler sensitivity, and anti-interference in detection and imaging [1]. Electromagnetic (EM) stealth technology aims to make the target undetectable and protect the target. It is essential in military and civilian fields. However, the rapid development of terahertz radar technology has threatened conventional stealth devices [2]. Radar cross-section (RCS) reduction is the most significant aspect of the EM stealth device [3]. Therefore, the terahertz EM device for RCS reduction is worth investigating.

The low-profile metasurface can efficiently manipulate EM waves’ amplitude, phase, and polarization. Metasurface-based EM devices, such as the absorber, polarization converter, metalens, orbital angular momentum multiplexer, and demultiplexer, have become a research highlight [4]. RCS reduction metasurfaces have made significant progress. Most research focuses on the metasurface-based low-RCS high-gain antenna [5,6,7,8,9,10]. This research introduces complex multilayer structures to reduce RCS and enhance the gain of the meta-antenna. Some of the studies work on realizing a simple structured RCS reduction metasurface [3,11,12]. Some research further optimizes the metasurface using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), and pseudorandom algorithm [13,14,15]. In addition, the conformal RCS reduction metasurface is also investigated to improve adaptability [16,17,18]. However, the existing research concentrates on the RCS reduction metasurface with fixed performance working in the microwave band.

The dynamic metasurface (reconfigurable or tunable metasurfaces) combined with active components is superior to the fixed metasurface in flexibility, such as graphene, positive–intrinsic–negative (PIN) diode, varactor diode, and liquid crystal [19,20]. The performance of the dynamic metasurface is tunable by controlling the active component. Some achievements have been made in the dynamic RCS reduction metasurface recently. Applying PIN and varactor diodes realizes the low-RCS and high-gain antenna with reconfigurable scattering patterns [21,22]. For the vertical incident wave, using graphene-based and PIN diode-based coding metasurfaces dynamically manipulates the scattering field [23,24,25,26]. To steer the scattering field, broadband, and wide-angle metasurfaces hybridized with graphene and PIN diode are investigated [27,28]. A wideband low-scattering metasurface with an in-band tunable transparent window is also studied by loading the PIN diode [29]. Nevertheless, there is little research on the terahertz dynamic RCS reduction metasurface.

This paper offers a terahertz dynamic coding metasurface integrated with vanadium dioxide (VO2) for dual-polarized, dual-band, and wide-angle RCS reduction. Considering the influence of the incident wave’s polar and azimuth angles, an RCS reduction formula that covers the incident angle is derived first. Then, a coding metasurface with the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is designed. The top metal resonator embedded with VO2 and a middle dielectric and bottom metal plate forms the meta-atom of the metasurface. VO2 undergoes the insulator-to-metal transition at around 68 °C [30]. Thus, regulating the VO2 state can effectively change the performance of the meta-atom. The Pancharatnam–Berry (PB) phase (geometric phase) is applied to obtain the required abrupt phase under a circularly polarized (CP) incident wave [31,32]. As the meta-atom rotation angle is limited to 0° and 90°, the metasurface is valid for both left-handed circularly polarized (LCP) and right-handed circularly polarized (RCP) incident waves. The simulation result demonstrates that the metasurface can achieve a 10 dB RCS reduction from 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz (the relative bandwidth is 28.6%) and 0.35 THz to 0.43 THz (the relative bandwidth is 20.5%) under LCP and RCP incident waves. When the polar and azimuth angles of the incident wave vary from 0° to 40° and 0° to 360°, the metasurface can generally maintain the 10 dB RCS reduction. Therefore, the terahertz VO2-based dynamic coding metasurface can effectively implement the dual-band, dual-polarized, and wide-angle RCS reduction. This work owns potential value in the terahertz stealth field.

2. Design Principle

First, consider a coding metasurface arranged in a rectangular grid on the xoy plane. There are Nx and Ny elements in the x- and y-directions, respectively. The distances between the elements are Dx and Dy in the x- and y-direction. The metasurface is excited by a plane wave with a polar angle θi and azimuth angle φi. According to the phased array theory [33,34], and simultaneously considering the influence of the incident wave’s angle, for the radiated field at a point in space (θ,φ), the phase difference between elements consists of three parts: the abrupt phase ϕ1 introduced by the element, the phase delay ϕ2 caused by the element’s spatial position, and the phase delay ϕ3 caused by the incident wave. For the nxnyth element, ϕ2 and ϕ3 can be written as:(1) ϕ2(nx,ny)=k0sinθ(2nx−12Dxcosφ+2ny−12Dysinφ)

(2) ϕ3(nx,ny)=k0sinθi(2nx−12Dxcosφi+2ny−12Dysinφi)

Therefore, take the amplitude A(nx,ny) in each element into consideration and write the array factor Fa of the metasurface as:(3) Fa(θ,φ)=∑nx=0Nx∑ny=0NyA(nx,ny)expj[ϕ1(nx,ny)+ϕ2(nx,ny)+ϕ3(nx,ny)]

The wave number k0 = 2πC/f0, C is the wave velocity in free space, and f0 is the frequency.

Then, to optimize the RCS reduction effect, the WOA [35] is employed. The fitness function Ffit is the maximum value of Fa. Express Ffit as:(4) Ffit=max[Fa(θ,φ)]

Figure 1 shows the WOA-based optimization process. Firstly, set the number of search agents Nse, the number of variables Ndim = Nx × Ny, and the maximum number of iterations Nit. Then, initialize the whale population with a random coding matrix Xini (i = 1, 2, …, Nse). Xini contains Ndim elements. The elements are 0 or 1. Initialize the best search agent Xbe to null matrix and the best score Sbe to positive infinity. Next, perform iterative optimization. Calculate the Ffit of each search agent using Equations (3) and (4) and update Xbe and Sbe if there is a better solution. Update the position of the search agent by encircling prey, spiral bubble-net attacking method, and search for prey. Finally, terminate the loop when the number of iterations reaches the maximum. Obtain the optimized coding matrix Xbe and minimum value of Sbe.

Furthermore, according to Equation (1), f0 is a function of Fa. The coding sequence of the metasurface should change as f0 varies. Therefore, apply VO2 to tune the metasurface. Use the equivalent complex permittivity ε and conductivity σ to describe VO2 [36,37]. Based on the Drude model, write ε and σ as:(5) ε(ω)=ε∞−ωp2(σ)ω2+jγω

(6) σ(ω)=jε0ωp2(σ)ω+jγ

(7) ωp2(σ)≈σσ0ωp2(σ0)

ε∞ is the permittivity at high frequency, ωp (σ) is the plasma frequency, and the collision frequency γ equals 5.75 × 1013 s−1. ωp (σ0) = 1.4 × 1015 rad/s with σ0 = 3 × 103 Ω−1cm−1 and ε∞ = 12. σ are taken to 200 S/m and 2 × 105 S/m with the insulating and metallic VO2, respectively. Switching the state of the VO2 can theoretically realize the dynamic regulation of the metasurface.

At last, apply the PB phase principle to realize the required coding metasurface [31,32,38]. Consider an x-polarized or y-polarized wave incident to the reflective meta-atom along the negative z-direction. Express the incident and reflected waves as:(8) [ExEy]out=[cos(2φrot)−sin(2φrot)−sin(2φrot)−cos(2φrot)][ExEy]in

Ex and Ey represent the linearly polarized (LP) waves. φrot is the rotation angle of the meta-atom. The CP wave can be composed of two LP waves:(9) [ELER]in=12[1−j1j][ExEy]in

(10) [ELER]out=12[1j1−j][ExEy]out

EL and ER are the LCP and RCP waves, respectively. Combine Equations (8)–(10):(11) [ELER]out=[e−j2φrot00ej2φrot][ELER]in

Therefore, there is a −2φrot (2φrot) phase difference between the LCP (RCP) incident wave and the corresponding co-polarized reflected wave. The phase difference, which relates to the incident wave’s polarization state, is the PB phase. φrot is limited to 0° and 90° to acquire the same PB phase under LCP and RCP waves.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Meta-Atom

Figure 2 displays the structure schematic diagram of the proposed metasurface’s meta-atom. Figure 2a,b indicate the metal-VO2 resonator, dielectric layer, and metal plate form the meta-atom. The resonator consists of two split-ring resonators (SRRs) labeled SRR 1 and SRR 2. The SRRs embed two patches of VO2, labeled VO2 1 and VO2 2. The metal is gold (Au, σ = 4.561 × 107 S/m) with a thickness tm of 0.2 μm. The VO2 patch has two states: insulator (σ = 200 S/m) and metal (σ = 2 × 105 S/m). The thickness tv of the VO2 is 0.2 μm. The dielectric is silica (SiO2, εr = 3.8) with a thickness ts of 120 μm. In Figure 2c, the period P of the meta-atom is 280 μm. The radii r1 and r2 of SRRs are 120 μm and 80 μm, respectively. The line widths g1 and g2 are 10 μm. The angles α1 and α2 of arc-shaped VO2 patches are 5°. The angles between VO2 patches and the positive x-axis are φ1 and φ2, respectively. Owing to the different states of the VO2 patch, the Au-VO2 resonator can exhibit various performances. As Figure 2d suggests, when VO2 1 and VO2 2 are in the insulating and metallic states, respectively, the Au-VO2 resonator is approximately equivalent to an SRR with a rotation angle φ1 and a complete ring labeled State 1. SRR 1 works, while SRR 2 is invalid. The meta-atom rotates φ1. For State 2, the Au-VO2 resonator is approximately equivalent to an SRR with a rotation angle φ2 and a complete ring. SRR 1 does not work, while SRR 2 is effective. The meta-atom rotates φ2. Thus, in theory, switching the state of VO2 patches can tune the working frequency and the PB phase of the meta-atom under a CP incident wave.

CST Studio Suite 2022 was used to simulate the designed meta-atom. The Frequency Domin Solver and Tetrahedral mesh type were selected. The unit cell boundary condition was applied in the x and y-directions and the open (add space) in the z-direction. The Floquet boundary was set in the z-direction with CP excitation. The Drude dispersion model was adapted to simulate VO2 with different states. φ1 and φ2 were restricted to 0° and 90° to introduce the same PB phase under LCP and RCP waves. For the meta-atom in State 1, Figure 3 and Figure 4 exhibit the simulation result. According to Figure 3a and Figure 4a, for the LCP and RCP normal incident waves, the magnitudes of the co-polarized reflection coefficients RLL and RRR are above −1 dB and the cross-polarized reflection coefficients RRL and RLR are less than −10 dB in the frequency ranging from 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz. For the LCP incident wave, take φ1 changes from 0° to 90° with φ2 = 0° as an example. Figure 3b indicates a phase difference of 180°. For the RCP incident wave, take φ1 = 0° with φ2 = 0° and φ1 = 90° with φ2 = 90° as an example. The phase difference is also about 180° based on the Figure 4b. It is thus clear that for the meta-atom in State 1, most of the CP incident wave converts into a co-polarized reflected wave within 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz. Furthermore, rotating VO2 1 from 0° to 90° can introduce the same phase difference of 180° under LCP and RCP waves.

For State 2 with metallic VO2 1 and insulating VO2 2, Figure 5 and Figure 6 exhibit the simulation result. According to Figure 5a and Figure 6a, for the LCP and RCP normal incident waves, the magnitudes of RLL and RRR are above −2 dB, while RRL and RLR are less than −10 dB within 0.35 THz to 0.43 THz. For the LCP incident wave, take φ2 varies from 0° to 90° with φ1 = 0° as an example. While for the RCP incident wave, take φ1 = 0° with φ2 = 0° and φ1 = 90° with φ2 = 90° as an example. Figure 5b and Figure 6b suggest a phase difference of approximately 180°. Therefore, when the meta-atom is in State 2, most of the CP incident wave is converted into the co-polarized reflected wave in the frequency range of 0.35 THz to 0.43 THz. A same phase difference of 180° can be acquired by rotating VO2 2 from 0° to 90° under LCP and RCP waves.

For the meta-atom in State 1 and State 2, Figure 7 shows the corresponding electric field distributions at 0.21 THz and 0.39 THz. The resonant structure switches between SRR 1 and SRR 2 by varying the states of VO2 1 and VO2 2. Moreover, there is a strong field at the opening of the SRR with different φ1 and φ2.

Based on the above results, adjusting the states of VO2 1 and VO2 2 can effectively switch the working frequency band of the meta-atom between 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz and 0.35 THz to 0.43 THz. Controlling the rotation angles φ1 and φ2 can easily change the PB phase. In addition, limiting φ1 and φ2 to 0° and 90° can bring in the same PB phase of 0° and 180° under the LCP and RCP waves.

3.2. Coding Metasurface

Design a 1-bit coding metasurface for verification. The metasurface consists of 5 × 5 coding elements. Each element contains 4 × 4 meta-atom. PB phases of 0° and 180° denote codes “0” and “1”, respectively. That is, the meta-atom in State 1 with φ1 = 0° and State 2 with φ2 = 0° represents “0”, while the meta-atom in State 1 with φ1 = 90° and State 2 with φ2 = 90° represents “1”. In Equations (1)–(3), Nx = Ny = 5 and Dx = Dy = 4 × P. Take amplitudes A(nx,ny) of meta-atoms equal each other. When the meta-atom operates at 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz, take f0 = 0.21 THz, θi = 0°, and φi = 0° as an example for optimization. While the meta-atom operates at 0.35 THz to 0.43 THz, take f0 = 0.39 THz, θi = 0°, and φi = 0° as an example for optimization. According to the WOA-based optimization process, set Nse = 120, Ndim = 25, and Nit = 400. Use MATLAB R2017a software to optimize the coding sequence. The optimal Coding Sequences 1 and 2 at 0.21 THz and 0.39 THz are shown in Figure 8a and Figure 8b, respectively. Figure 8c displays the optimal fitness Curve 1 at 0.21 THz and Curve 2 at 0.39 THz. Ffit decreases from 8.21 to 6.58 in Curve 1 and from 10.56 to 7.63 in Curve 2. According to Equation (3), when all of the elements are “0” or “1” in the coding sequence, Ffit equals 25 theoretically. Therefore, using the optimal coding sequence can significantly reduce Ffit.

Figure 9 shows the schematic of the terahertz VO2-based dynamic coding metasurface for RCS reduction. When the meta-atoms are in State 1, Coding Sequence 1 is activated, and the metasurface can realize effective RCS reduction under the LCP and RCP incident waves with the frequency f1, polar angle θ1, and azimuth angle φ1. When Coding Sequence 2 is in an active state with the meta-atoms in State 2, the metasurface can attain the RCS reduction under the CP incident wave with f2, θ2, and φ2.

CST Studio Suite 2022 was used to analyze the 1-bit coding metasurface. The Time Domin Solver and Hexahedral mesh type were selected. The open (add space) boundary condition was applied in the x, y, and z-directions, and, simultaneously, a metal plate of the same size as the metasurface was simulated for comparison. When the metasurface is in State 1, Figure 10 shows the far-field pattern under the CP incident wave with f1 = 0.21 THz, θ1 = 0°, and φ1 = 0°. For Figure 10a–c, the maximum numbers are −35.5, −35.1, and −22.3. For the metasurface in State 2, Figure 11 shows the far-field pattern under the CP incident wave with f2 = 0.39 THz, θ2 = 0°, and φ2 = 0°. For Figure 11a–c, the maximum numbers are −31, −31.2, and −16.9. In addition, Figure 10e,f and Figure 11e,f displace the corresponding array factor calculated in MATLAB. Figure 10a–d reveal that the metasurface can obtain about a 13 dB RCS reduction. Figure 11a–d exhibit an RCS reduction of 14 dB. Therefore, the simulation result demonstrates that for LCP and RCP waves with θi = 0° and φi = 0°, switching the state of the VO2 patch can simultaneously realize an RCS reduction of no less than 10 dB at 0.21 THz and 0.39 THz.

Further, the broadband and wide-angle characteristics of the metasurface were investigated. For the metasurface in State 1, taking the LCP incident wave as an example, f1 is in the range of 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz. θ1 and φ1 vary from 0° to 60° and 0° to 360°, respectively. Figure 12 shows the simulation result. Figure 12a suggests that for the LCP oblique incident wave with φ1 = 0° and θ1 = 0°, 20°, and 40°, the RCS reduction is above 10 dB from 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz. Figure 12b indicates that when the LCP wave with θ1 = 40° and φ1 = 0°, 30°, 120°, 210°, and 300° obliquely incidents on the metasurface, the RCS reduction is also generally not less than 10 dB at 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz. For the metasurface in State 2, taking the RCP incident wave as an example, Figure 13 reveals that when φ2 = 0° with θ2 changing from 0° to 40° and θ2 = 40° with φ2 varying from 0° to 360°, the metasurface can maintain a 10 dB RCS reduction from 0.35 THz to 0.43 THz.

Based on the above results, for the LCP and RCP incident waves with the polar angle and the azimuth angle ranging from 0° to 40° and 0° to 360°, respectively, the effective RCS reduction can be realized at 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz and 0.21 THz to 0.39 THz by tuning VO2. Table 1 shows a comparison of this work with previous works. Comparison items include dynamicity, polarization, 10 dB RCS reduction bandwidth (BW), fractional bandwidth (FBW), and max incident angle θi. The existing research concentrates on the RCS reduction metasurface with fixed performance working in the microwave band. The proposed VO2-based dynamic coding metasurface can realize the terahertz dual-polarized, dual-band, and wide-angle RCS reduction.

4. Conclusions

This paper exhibits a method for the terahertz VO2-based dynamic coding metasurface. This metasurface can realize a dual-polarized, dual-band, and wide-angle RCS reduction. The meta-atom consists of the resonator, dielectric layer, and metal plate. Two SRRs embedded with two patches of VO2 compose the resonator. The simulation results prove that adjusting the state of VO2 can effectively change the working frequency band and PB phase of the meta-atom. In addition, limiting the rotation angle to 0° and 90° can introduce the same PB phase of 0° and 180° under the LCP and RCP waves. A 1-bit coding metasurface optimized by the WOA for verification was designed. The simulation results demonstrate that for LCP and RCP vertical incident waves, tuning VO2 patches between insulating and metallic states can simultaneously realize an RCS reduction of no less than 10 dB at 0.21 THz and 0.39 THz. Furthermore, the simulation results indicate that for the LCP and RCP oblique incident waves with the polar angle, and the azimuth angle ranging from 0° to 40° and 0° to 360°, respectively, the metasurface can maintain the effective RCS reduction at 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz and 0.21 THz to 0.39 THz. This work has potential value in the terahertz stealth field. Moreover, Surface Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, micro-nano machining technology, and lithography technology could manufacture the proposed metasurface. Testing the far-field pattern in the THz chamber could verify the performance. Heating could induce the VO2 state transition.
