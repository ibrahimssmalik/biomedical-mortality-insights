pmcCorrection: Journal of Cheminformatics (2024) 16:48 10.1186/s13321-024-00843-y

Following publication of the original article [1], the authors identified a formatting error.The phrase "…with the computational cost exceeding 107 core-hours" in the Abstract should be replaced with "…with the computational cost exceeding 107 core-hours"

The statement "…with a total computational cost of more than 107 core-hours" in the Conclusions section should be changed to "…with a total computational cost of more than 107 core-hours"

The original article has been corrected.
