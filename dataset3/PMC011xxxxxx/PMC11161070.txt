Mansonella spp. have been reported to have a wide global distribution. Despite the distribution and co-occurrence with other filarial parasites like Wuchereria bancrofti, Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa, it is given little attention. There are few surveillance programmes for assessing the distribution of mansonellosis, due to the associated mild to no symptoms experienced by infected people. However, addressing this infection is critical to the onchocerciasis control program as current rapid diagnostic tools targeting O. volvulus have the tendency to cross react with Mansonella species. In this study we identified and characterised M. perstans from five sites in two districts in the Volta Region of Ghana and compared them to samples from other regions. Night blood smears and filter blood blots were obtained from individuals as part of a study on lymphatic filariasis. The Giemsa-stained smears were screened by microscopy for the presence of filarial parasites. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood blots from 39 individuals that were positive for M. perstans and Nested PCR targeting the internal spacer 1 (ITS-1) was conducted. Of these, 30 were sequenced and 24 sequences were kept for further analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of 194 nucleotide positions showed no differences in the samples collected. The similarities suggests that there could be one species in this area. However, more robust studies with larger sample sizes are required to draw such conclusions. We also observed a clustering of the samples from Ghana with reference sequences from Africa and Brazil, suggesting they could be related. This study draws further attention to a neglected infection, presents the first characterisation of M. perstans in Ghana and calls for more population-based studies across different geographical zones to ascertain species variations and disease distribution.

pmcIntroduction

Mansonellosis is a neglected tropical disease predominantly prevalent in the tropics and subtropics, with notable occurrences in Latin America, including Brazil and the Caribbean, as well as in sub-Saharan Africa [1]. The greatest burden of Mansonella infection is observed in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 114 million individuals are infected, while nearly 600 million people are at risk of contracting the disease [1,2]. It is caused by the filarial nematodes, Mansonella perstans, M. ozzardi and M. streptocerca. Of the three species, M. ozzardi is the major species in Latin America and the Caribbean, while M. perstans and M. streptocerca are reported in Africa [3]. Transmission is through the bite of infective midges (Culicoides spp.) and Simulium blackflies (transmitting M. ozzardi in parts of Latin America) [4–7]. In Cameroon, C. milnei is the primary vector for M. perstans [8]. C. milnei, C. imicola, and C. inornatipennis have been described in Benin [9]. While in Ghana, C. inornatipennis is highly anthropophilic and could be the major vector [10]. Following the bite of an infective vector, infective larvae penetrate the bite wound and develop into adult worms that reside in serous body cavities or subcutaneous tissues [11]. Female adult worms produce thousands of unsheathed microfilariae that exhibit no periodicity (this is the diagnostic stage) [11]. Midges take up bloodmeal, ingesting microfilariae which then grow into infective larvae that can be injected into humans to continue the cycle. There are no distinct symptoms and clinical manifestations may range from headache, pruritus, eosinophilia, to pain in bursae, joint synovia, i.e. serous cavities and abdominal pain, proptosis, swelling of the eye and nodules in the conjunctiva, resembling Calabar swelling in Loa loa infection have been reported [12–14]. Diagnosis is by demonstration of microfilariae in peripheral blood [15]. Unlike other filarial infections such as lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis there is no standard treatment for Mansonella infection. However, the distribution of ivermectin (IVM) through mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns for lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis may have impacted M. perstans prevalence [16]. On the contrary, there have been reports of high M. perstans prevalence in rainforest settings in Camerron following decades of MDA suggesting that IVM is not effective [17]. However, drugs like diethylcarbamazine, mebendazole and doxycycline (which targets the bacteria endosymbiont Wolbachia) have been used to successfully clear the adult worms and reduce microfilariae burden in humans [18–21].

M. perstans has been reported along the coastal areas of equatorial Brazil and the Caribbean [1]. A highly prevalent variant of M. perstans variant known as “DEUX” was also identified in Gabon [22]. Further studies suggest its relatedness to strains from Brazil and further concludes that the strains from Brazil may have diverged from “DEUX” [22,23].

The first report of mansonellosis was in 1922 where, M. streptocerca was identified in the skin of indigenes from Gold Coast, now Ghana [24]. Subsequently, M. perstans was reported in the 1991 by Awadzi and colleagues [25]. However, its pathogenicity was poorly understood. Few studies have tried to ascertain the epidemiology, with a paucity of information. Other works in the 90’s also reported on the presence of M. perstans in the Volta Region, but, the prevalence was not known [25]. Following on, in 2014, a study reported a high burden of M. perstans in individuals coinfected with Buruli Ulcer that were sampled from 2010–2012 in the middle belt of Ghana [26]. This report showed a 23% M. perstans in Buruli Ulcer patients compared to 13% in control participants. In 2017, Debrah and colleagues reported an average of 32% and as high as 75% infection prevalence in communities in the middle belt of Ghana [10]. Whereas gender may influence the risk of infection in some settings, although more studies are needed to substantiate these differences, infections appear to increase with age [10,27–29]. Furthermore, the environment plays a key role in vector-borne disease transmission dynamics and M. perstans is no exception. M. perstans occurs in rainforest areas with dense vegetation in Africa, where tree holes and vegetation cover support the breeding of vectors [10,17,30–34]. High prevalence of M. perstans infections have been linked to high vegetation, swampy areas and where livestock droppings provided suitable breeding conditions for the midges [10].

Despite its wide distribution, mansonellosis tends to be neglected due to its typically mild and asymptomatic nature [35]. This lack of attention may be attributed to the limited surveillance, monitoring activities, and inadequate funding for assessing the burden and implementing control measures [1,6]. However, it’s noted that mansonellosis could impact immune regulatory mechanisms, potentially leading to immune suppression and risk of susceptibility and severe outcome of co-infections with other diseases like malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB) as well as vaccine efficacy [1,6,36]. Studies in pregnant women with malaria and or HIV showed increased risk of anaemia in the presence of M. perstans infections [32,37,38]. These suggests a complex public health scenario that requires urgent attention.

Despite the growing evidence of M. perstans presence and possible contribution to filarial morbidities, it still remains understudied [35,39]. Additionally, evidence presented by some studies, indicating that 10% of all infections may lead to disease morbidity [35], calls for further studies in understanding the health impact of this widely distributed and prevalent filarial parasite [40]. Furthermore, the co-occurrence with other filarial parasites poses a great challenge to current diagnostic kits and present a need for the development of new diagnostics. For instance, cross-reactivity with serology-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for LF often leads to over estimations of LF prevalence, posing challenges to evaluating intervention efforts [18,41–43].This therefore underscores the importance of increased awareness, surveillance, and funding to better understand and address mansonellosis and its potential impact on public health, especially in regions where it coexists with other filarial parasites and other infectious diseases. This study aimed to characterise Mansonella spp. identified during a study assessing the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis in some districts in the Volta and Eastern Regions of Ghana.

Materials and methods

Ethics statement

The study was conducted in agreement with the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (CPN 061/16-17) and the Ethics Review Committee of the Ghana Health Service (GHS-ERC 06/08/16). Written consent was obtained from all study participants. For children, written parental consent was obtained, and written assent from children 12 to 17 years old. Participation in this study was voluntary and study objectives, potential risks, benefits, and rights to discontinue were explained to the participants. Data was anonymized prior to analysis.

Study sites

The study was conducted in 2018 in the East Akyim district (Eastern Region), Adaklu district (Volta Region) and Hohoe district (Volta Region) of Ghana. Communities with M. perstans are shown in Fig 1. In each district participants were recruited from 15 communities based on population proportional to estimated size. These districts experience two raining seasons, with an average rainfall of 513.9 mm to 1099.88 mm. Temperature ranges from 12°C to 32°C. The areas have varying vegetation cover ranging from Forest to savannah grassland, highland areas and in the forest zone which receive the highest rainfall and the dry Sahel savannah zone in the north [44]. The maps (in Fig 1.) were generated using open source QGIS Desktop 3.32.2. Shapefiles used are available at https://github.com/Millicen/Mansonella_perstans/blob/main/GHA_adm.zip and publicly available for download at https://www.diva-gis.org/gdata.

Communities sampled are in circles with yellow and grey indicating sites with M. perstans positives and negatives respectively.

Sample collection

Nighttime blood samples were collected between 21:00 and 2:00 from 50–100 randomly selected participants (aged 5 years and above) from each community. 60μl of the blood was used for the preparation of blood films for the identification of W. bancrofti microfilariae (mf) and 60 μl to prepare six dry blood spots (DBS), on the six discs of the Tropbio filter paper (Tropbio Pty Ltd, QLD, Australia). The blood films were stained with Giemsa and observed under a compound microscope.

Sample processing and analysis

Following the identification of M. perstans in the blood films, 39 DBS were retrieved from individuals that tested positive for M. perstans. DNA was extracted from 3 discs of the DBS each per participant. The extractions were done using, the Quick-DNA™ MiniPrep (Zymo Research, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with 75 μL elution volume. Briefly, 400 μl of Genomic Lysis Buffer containing beta-mercaptoethanol in 0.5%(v/v) was added to the DBS followed by vortexing for 4–6 seconds, and then incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The liquid containing the DNA was transferred to a Zymo-Spin™ IICR Column placed in a Collection Tube (ensure that no particles of the filter paper is pipetted with the sample). This was followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for one minute. The Collection Tube with the flow through was discarded. The Zymo-Spin™ IICR Column was transferred to a new Collection Tube. 200 μl of DNA Pre-Wash Buffer was added to the spin column and then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for one minute. 500 μl of g-DNA Wash Buffer was added to the spin column and then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for one minute. Finally, the spin column was transferred to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and 75 μl DNA Elution Buffer was added to the base of the spin column. This was incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for one minute to elute the DNA. The eluted DNA was stored at -20°C for future use. The sample were then screened for Filarial parasites using Nested PCR [45]).

Detection of filarial parasites by nested PCR

The Nested PCRs were carried out using four primers described in Tang and colleagues [45]. The primers included a universal primer (UN1-1R) that hybridise to the 5.8S ribosomal gene of all filarial species and other vertebrates (including mammals); the other three primers are universal to all filarial species of which two are forward primers (FIL-1F; used in the Nest I reaction, and FIL-2R; used in Nest II reaction), and one reverse primer (FIL-2R; used in Nest II). These primers amplify the ITS-1 region. The nest I reaction, included the FIL-1F (5`GTGCTGTAACCATTACCGAAAGG-3`) and UNI-1R (5`- CGCAGCTAGCTGCGTTCTTCATCG-3`) in a total reaction of 15 μL, with 300 nM primers, 300 nM dNTPmix, 1X Go-Taq PCR Buffer, 0.033 units of Go-Taq polymerase and 3 μL of the DNA. The PCRs were run at 94°C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 7 min. The nest I was followed with nest II usingprimers, FIL-2F (5`-GGTGAACCTGCGGAAGGATC-3`) and FIL-2R (5`-

TGCTTATTAAGTCTACTTAA-3`) in a 15 μL reaction, containing, 300 nM primers, 300 nM dNTPmix, 1X Go-Taq PCR Buffer, 0.033 units of Go-Taq polymerase and 2 μL of PCR product from the nest I reaction. The PCRs were run at 94°C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 50°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 7 min.

The expected band sizes for nest I reaction, depending on the species are Onchocerca volvulus: 771 bp, Mansonella perstans: 739 bp, Mansonella ozzardi: 734 bp, Wuchereria bancrofti: 723 bp, Loa loa: 712 bp). However, these bands may not be visible if DNA concentrations are low. The expected band sizes depending on the filarial species for the nest II reaction are O. volvulus: 344 bp, M. perstans: 312 bp, M. ozzardi: 305 bp, W. bancrofti: 301 bp and Loa loa: 286 bp. The step-by-step protocol for the DNA extraction and Nested PCR have been deposited in protocols.io repository, http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.x54v928b4l3e/v1.

Gel electrophoresis and purification

The Nest I and II PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel for 40 min and visualised under Dual LED Blue/White Light Transilluminator (BluPADTM, Bio-Helix co., ltd). The bands from the Nest II were excised for further purification using GF-1 Gel DNA Recovery Kit (GeneOn, Germany). The excised gel was weighed. Buffer GB was added to the gel in a ratio of 1:1v/v and incubated at 50°C until the gel had melted. The mixture was then transferred to the column and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for one minute. The column was washed with 750 μL Wash Buffer. The flow through was discarded and the column was spun at 10,000 x g to dry. 30 μL of Elution Buffer was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. The column was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for one minute to elute the DNA. The recovered DNA (5μL) were run on a 2% agarose gel to confirm if DNA has been successfully extracted. The step-by-step protocol for the gel purification and electrophoresis have been deposited in protocols.io repository, http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.x54v928b4l3e/v1. The DNA was stored at -20°C until they were shipped for sequencing. In total, 30 DNA samples that gave a 312 bp band (Figs 2 and S2 Table) following the Nest II reaction (including a no template control) were sent to Inqaba Biotechnologies, South Africa for Sanger sequencing.

Sequence analysis

Sequencing was done in 2021, with two reads obtained per sample. Raw reads were imported into Geneious Prime and poor reads were trimmed with an error probability limit of 0.05 (where more than 5% chance of error per base called are trimmed). The trimmed reads have been deposited in GenBank repository with Accession No. OR488627 to 51. The De Novo Assemble function was then used to generate consensus sequence for each pair rooted with DQ995497 (Loa loa). The trimmed consensus sequences were exported to MEGAX [46] to infer ancestry of the sequences. Briefly, the sequences were aligned with MUSCLE and gap open set at -400 and maximum iteration set at 16. Model selection for Maximum Likelihood and the best model estimate of the relation selected was T92+G (based on least Bayesian information criteria (BIC) and corrected Akaike information Criteria (AICc) 1546.049 and 1038.347 respectively (see S3 Table). The rate variation among sites was modelled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 0.58). The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and Tamura 3-parameter model with 500 replicates. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (4 categories (+G, parameter = 0.1913)). An analysis of nucleotide variance was generated using popart v1.7 software [47].

Results

M. perstans was only identified in 6 communities in Hohoe (Abledzie, Akpatanu and Dzenana) and Adaklu (Ablornu, Afeyeame and Anfoe) districts (both in the Volta Region) see Fig 1, in yellow circles. The number of samples analysed from the communities are shown in S1 Table. The examination of blood slides revealed M. perstans infection in 33/1317 (2.51%) and 22/1355 (1.62%) individuals, respectively in these districts. The mf counts ranged from 16.7–12,350.0 mf/ml with a geometric mean of 188.6 mf/ml (S2 Table). None of the people screened in the East Akyim Districts were positive for Mansonella parasites (0/1074).

Due to inadequate resources and financial constraints, 39 out of the 55 microscopy positives were screened with the PCR assay. Out of the 39 samples that were processed, 29 were positive for M. perstans. No bands were observed for the nest I reactions. Fig 2. shows the band sizes of 312bp for nest II PCR, confirming the presence of M. perstans ITS-1 gene. No other species were detected.

Overall, 29 samples were sequenced using Sanger sequencing out of which 24 sequences (submitted to GenBank with Accession numbers: OR488627—OR488651) were kept for further analysis.

Phylogenetics

An alignment using MUSCLE in MEGAX was performed with 14 reference sequences

(LT623911.1, MZ285895, KR080185.1, EU272180 (M. ozzardi), DQ995497 (Loa loa), EU272181.1, EU272177.1, KR080189.1, KR080188.1, DQ995498.1, KJ631373.1, KR080187, EU272183.1 EU272182.1) are shown in Fig 3. Following the alignment, the ends were trimmed, and 194 nucleotide sites were kept for further analysis. The alignment file can be accessed via: https://github.com/Millicen/Mansonella_perstans/blob/main/Alignment.fas. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed similarity between the Ghana samples and M. perstans reference sequences as shown on the tree with 84% and 90% support for the branch lengths (Fig 4). KR080185.1 and MZ285895 which are reference sequences from Gabon and Senegal respectively show differences at some nucleotide positions. We did not see any population structuring in the samples obtained from the different locations in Ghana. Muscle Sequence alignment was generated in MEGA X with 24 Ghana samples and 14 reference sequences from Africa and Brazil.

Varius reference M. perstans sequences from Africa (including, Gabon, Senegal, Mali, Sierra Leone, Cote d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon) and Brazil, M. ozzardi were included with DQ995497 (Loa loa) as outgroup. The Ghana samples (OR488627 to 51) are coloured by location. The tree excluded OR488633 due to it short length.

Haplotype network

An analysis of molecular variance was computed using 24 of the sequenced samples (OR488633 was excluded due to the short length) references, and five M. perstans of which two were from Gabon (KR080185.1 and KJ631373.1), and one each from the Amazona State in Brazil (LT623911.1), Senegal (MZ285895) and Sierra Leone (EU272177.1). A Loa loa sequence was included as an outgroup (DQ995497) to allow for comparison of the ingroups and due to lack of high-quality M. perstans reference sequences see Fig 5. The nucleotide diversity index was π = 0.00898. A significantly high variation (98.24%) among populations, but low variation (1.76%) within populations, were observed with a total variance of 11.89% (fixation index (Phi_ST) = 0.982, p = 0.051). The observed variation was based on 22 bases where, one of the references from Gabon (KJ631373.1) and that of Senegal differed at one and two nucleotide bases respectively, whereas the outgroup had 19 base differences in respect to the Ghana samples. Also, little to no variations were observed between the KJ631373.1 (Gabon), LT623911.1(Brazil) and EU272177.1 (Sierra Leone) and the Ghana samples. No variations were seen in the Ghana samples (p < 0.001).

Discussion

In this study, sequences from individuals with M. perstans were analysed. We present the first characterisation of M. perstans internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) gene in Ghana. The Ghana samples showed no variations per the phylogenetic analysis (Fig 4) suggesting no geographical isolation in the population of M. perstans and hence maybe considered as one transmission zone with similar ecological conditions. However, given the small sample sizes with low numbers of representation per site, we are unable to draw firm conclusions on the populations. Nonetheless, our observation of the lack of variations in the sequences from this study in Ghana suggests that there could be only one species of M. perstans responsible for infections in the Volta Region. However, this needs to be substantiated with extensive sampling to include other study sites to understand M. perstans prevalence in the Volta Region.

Many sources of M. perstans infections in the world have been linked to Africa. In Italy and Spain, M. perstans were identified in immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa [48]. Infections in the Caribbean and the Americas, were linked to the transatlantic slave trade [23]. The clustering of the Ghana samples and other sequences from Gabon and Sierra Leone with the M. perstans ITS-1 (LT623911.1) from Brazil Amazona State (Fig 4) and other countries in Africa provides evidence of association. Findings of Tavares da Silva and colleagues [23] also showed that a recently published genome of M. perstans from Brazil shared similarity with those from Africa. Their work supported the origin of M. perstans from Africa into Latin America [23] following divergence from M. perstans “DEUX” clade from Gabon. The genetic diversity observed in Fig 5 specifically at 1 and 2 nucleotide base differences between the Gabon ("DEUX") and Senegal isolates respectively, and those from Ghana samples suggests potential variations in the genetic makeup of M. perstans populations in different geographic regions. The observed genetic differences as indicated by variations in nucleotide bases, raise the intriguing possibility that these discrepancies may delineate distinct species of M. perstans (Fig 5). Additionally, recent publication of the M. perstans genome [49] will enhance further studies and understanding of this very neglected parasite. Furthermore, the availability of these genomes now provides an avenue for comparative genomics studies of the different M. perstans clades and their pathogenesis.

Low infection rates were observed in the study participants. Perhaps if all the blood samples had been screened by a more sensitive assay, there could have been more positives as standard microscopy tests are usually less sensitive especially as infection wanes [50–52]. While the identification of M. perstans following microscopy was based on the ITS-1 gene, a newer and more sensitive method based on the M. perstans Repeat 1 (MpR1) has been developed [53]. Nonetheless, Eberhardt and colleagues also reported low prevalence of M. perstans in the serum of HIV patients in Ghana [54]. The low infection levels observed in the this and other studies could also be due to past ivermectin distribution for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis control in Ghana. Although infections may be low now, the interruption of LF and onchocerciasis in these areas and subsequent stopping of MDA, may result in mansonellosis resurgence in future.

Furthermore, the environment plays a crucial role in vector borne disease dynamics. Whereas areas with high vegetation index with dense forests provide suitable breeding habitats for vectors consequently leading to high vector densities and high transmission, areas with low vegetation cover or grasslands tend to have fewer suitable habitats for vector breeding. Studies in parts of Central and East Africa have reported on the association of high M. perstans prevalence with high vector density and distribution in areas with high vegetation index [31,32,34]. It is however unclear whether the low infection prevalence reported in this study, compared to high prevalence in the middle belt of Ghana is species specific or due to environmental variations that will allow high vector breeding potential and transmission. The Volta Region is characterised by grassland, dry Savannah, highlands and few forests [44] compared to the middle belt that has dense forests with swamps which support high vector density [10]. This therefore provides an opportunity for further investigation in the M. perstans in other parts of Ghana.

The Volta Region bears a significant malaria burden, as highlighted by previous studies [55,56]. The identification of M. perstans in the lower half of Ghana, particularly in the Volta Region, may exacerbate susceptibility to and the severity of malaria infections. Moreover, the documented prevalence of coinfections and M. perstans’ influence on immune modulation and disease progression across Africa [6,30,36–38] emphasize the need to address mansonellosis within a broader public health initiative. The coexistence of M. perstans and high malaria prevalence in the Volta Region underscores the necessity for comprehensive strategies and interventions. Integrating mansonellosis surveillance with existing programs targeting lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis and malaria in Ghana presents a practical approach. This integration not only streamlines efforts but also offers insights into the interplay between various parasitic infections and their collective impact on public health. Such initiatives would enable the development of tailored interventions to tackle the challenges posed by multiple parasitic infections in affected regions of Ghana. Ultimately, this report emphasizes the importance of a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to address the intricate landscape of M. perstans infections and their implications for public health in the region.

Conclusion

Despite the potential impact of M. perstans on diseases of public health importance, it receives little attention. Consequently, there is no standard treatment and surveillance to track the extent of endemicity. Although symptoms are not clearly defined it is believed to impact host immune reactions and may play a crucial role in disease pathogenesis especially where it is co-endemic with other filarial parasites. In this study, we present the first characterisation of M. perstans in Ghana. Furthermore, the phylogenetics analysis reveals clustering of isolates from Ghana with that of Brazil. We did not observe any differences in the sequences obtained from the study sites which could probably be due to small sample size. We therefore advocate for population-based studies with a bigger target (or whole genome sequence data) that will include more samples from different locations across different geographical settings. Additionally, the coexistence of M. perstans with other blood filarial worms presents a unique opportunity for screening one sample from a single individual allowing for parallel monitoring for assessing the public health impact of mansonellosis in populations.

Reviewer #1: Dear Authors,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your paper titled "Identification and characterisation of 'Mansonella perstans' in the Volta Region of Ghana." This study addresses a critical and often overlooked aspect of parasitology, particularly the prevalence and characteristics of 'Mansonella perstans', a notable filarial parasite, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

Introduction:

1. Your introduction comprehensively covers the species, distribution, transmission, clinical manifestations, and the main diagnostic methods of 'Mansonella perstans'. However, it could benefit from a clearer exposition on the current understanding (or lack thereof) of effective treatments for 'M. perstans', drawing a comparison with treatments available for onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis (LF) where at least one effective treatment is avaliable.

2. The third paragraph, while informative, could be restructured for better flow and clarity.

3. Is there any historical data on 'Mansonella' in Ghana before? Understanding if there was a difference in the epidemiology of the parasite before and after (now) interventions for onchocerciasis and LF (as well as population growth and associated consequences) could be insightful

Methodology:

4. (2.1 Study Site) Figure A could be more well defined, although it is readable. I could only find the Hohoe and Adaklu districts, but not East Akyium district, understandably because the latter was negative for M. perstans; however, Figure 1 should not mention that M. perstans is only present in the two former districts, as it is part of the results, not the methodology.

5. (2.3 Sample Processing and Analysis) Please provide clarity on which filarial parasites were screened using Nested PCR (O. volvulus, M. perstans and M. perstans?) and the CO1 gene. Also, are these results presented, even if negative, in the result section?

6. (2.6 Sequence Analysis) The rationale for using the 'Loa Loa' sequence instead of a 'Mansonella perstans' sequence would benefit from explanation. If the choice was due to the lack of high-quality reference sequences from 'M. perstans', this should be explicitly stated.

Results:

7. The range of microfilariae counts is indeed remarkable and adds significant value to the study. It would be beneficial to include the number of individuals screened for 'M. perstans' in East Akyim District, even if the results were negative.

8. Additionally, the placement of each figure legend immediately following its corresponding description would aid in readability and comprehension instead of all at the end of the Results section.

Discussion:

9. The first paragraph of the Discussion section might be more appropriate in the Introduction, considering its content.

10. The phylogenetic analysis suggesting no variation between the non-contiguous Hohoe and Adalku districts raises intriguing questions about the potential prevalence of 'M. perstans' in surrounding districts. This could be an interesting avenue for future research to understand the prevalence of the parasite in the Volta region. Moreover, the discussion could be expanded to explore the possibilities of integrating 'M. perstans' surveillance with existing lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis programmes in Ghana. It would also be beneficial to discuss the broader public health implications of M. perstans, especially in relation to co-infections with other filarial diseases.

Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field. The English could be polished to enhance the paper's clarity and readability. I look forward to seeing the revised version of this important work.

Best regards,

Reviewer #2: Opoku and Souza analysed M. perstans prevalence in the Volta region of Ghana and revealed low (up to 2.51%) infection rates. Moreover, they sequenced the samples and showed that the samples cluster with the reference sequences from other African countries and Brazil. It is very important to draw attention to this neglected filarial infection but the presented study lacks novelty and intense discussion (e.g., genome analysis). Moreover, the introduction and discussion lacks recent publication and is sometimes misleading. In my opinion, the manuscript need to be carefully re-written and updated before

Major comments:

1) Line 80-82: The authors highlight that pathogenicity is not known/was so far not assessed, but the presented data sets do also not tackle this issue. Similar to Debrah et al. the presented manuscript shows the prevalence of M. perstans in a specific region of Ghana. In summary, the infection rates are very low compared to the middle belt of Ghana. The authors need to discuss that fact also in regards to the characteristics of the environment that are needed for M. perstans. For example Wanji and colleagues from Cameroon presented over the last years several publications about that.

2) A long this line, the introduction need to be updated, such as Mansonella spp. DEUX is not mentioned (line 49-50), the transmitting vector for M. perstans (C. milnei) have been deciphered in Cameroon (line 50-51), and it should be mentioned that M. perstans has no distinct clinical symptoms and is mostly asymptomatic (line 55-57).

3) Line 64-67: Of course, mansonellosis is still neglected but the are several studies targeting Mansonella and it cannot be stated that it is only assessed during lymphatic filariasis or onchocerciasis surveillance programmes. Again, Wanji and colleagues specifically target Mansonella epidemiology, immunology and treatment efficacy (showing that ivermectin is not effective - should be included in line 68-70).

4) In my opinion, it is important to explain the applied methods more in detail. For example, the used PCR need to be shortly explained instead of only revising to a publication. What can be differentiated with this PCR (specificity/what filarial spp can be discriminated?). A long this line, Fig S1 shows a gel blot but there is no further explanation, such as what are the different bands in the sample lines.

5) In regards to 4), supplement figures/tables need to be embedded, explained and in order within the text.

6) How were the 30 samples that were sequences selected from the 39 positive individuals.

7) line 229-230: There are several studies showing the impact of M. perstans on concomitant infections (Muhangi et al. 2007; Hillier et al. 2008; Stensgaard et al. 2016), which can be explained by the strong immune modulation of M. perstans (Ritter et al. 2018).

8) Recently, there are three publications about the genome of Mansonella, which need to be discussed extensively to place the presented results into the context.

RESPONSE: The map has been revised and does not include any satellite or copyrighted images (Fig 1)

Reviewer #1:

Introduction:

1. Your introduction comprehensively covers the species, distribution, transmission, clinical manifestations, and the main diagnostic methods of 'Mansonella perstans'. However, it could benefit from a clearer exposition on the current understanding (or lack thereof) of effective treatments for 'M. perstans', drawing a comparison with treatments available for onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis (LF) where at least one effective treatment is avaliable.

RESPONSE: The treatment for M. perstans in comparison to the other filarial parasites has now been described in lines 80-84.

2. The third paragraph, while informative, could be restructured for better flow and clarity.

RESPONSE: The this has been addressed

3. Is there any historical data on 'Mansonella' in Ghana before? Understanding if there was a difference in the epidemiology of the parasite before and after (now) interventions for onchocerciasis and LF (as well as population growth and associated consequences) could be insightful

RESPONSE: Unfortunately, there haven’t been any studies to evaluate the impact of onchocerciasis and LF treatments on Mansonella in Ghana, hence we are unable to provide more information on this.

Methodology:

4. (2.1 Study Site) Figure A could be more well defined, although it is readable. I could only find the Hohoe and Adaklu districts, but not East Akyium district, understandably because the latter was negative for M. perstans; however, Figure 1 should not mention that M. perstans is only present in the two former districts, as it is part of the results, not the methodology.

RESPONSE: This has been corrected. The map has also been revised to include the other districts that were included in the bigger study.

5. (2.3 Sample Processing and Analysis) Please provide clarity on which filarial parasites were screened using Nested PCR (O. volvulus, M. perstans and M. perstans?) and the CO1 gene. Also, are these results presented, even if negative, in the result section?

RESPONSE: The Nested PCR assay was used, and this amplifies all the filarial parasites. However, only samples that were positive for M. perstans microscopy were screened. Notwithstanding, if all the samples were tested by PCR, there could have been more positives. Due to limited resources PCR wasn’t done on all the samples. This has been included as a limitation in the discussion section in lines All analysis were based on samples that tested positive for the ITS-1 gene. CO1 gene has been removed from the manuscript because, all the samples submitted were poorly sequenced. Lines 30, 48 and 178

6. (2.6 Sequence Analysis) The rationale for using the 'Loa Loa' sequence instead of a 'Mansonella perstans' sequence would benefit from explanation. If the choice was due to the lack of high-quality reference sequences from 'M. perstans', this should be explicitly stated.

RESPONSE: Loa loa was used as an outgroup due to low quality references and to allow for ingroup comparison. The write up has been updated to include this reason in lines 282 - 284

Results:

7. The range of microfilariae counts is indeed remarkable and adds significant value to the study. It would be beneficial to include the number of individuals screened for 'M. perstans' in East Akyim District, even if the results were negative.

1074 participants were tested in the East Akyim district and this has been included in the Methods section on line 241.

8. Additionally, the placement of each figure legend immediately following its corresponding description would aid in readability and comprehension instead of all at the end of the Results section.

RESPONSE: The figures have now been repositioned to appear after the just below their description.

Discussion:

9. The first paragraph of the Discussion section might be more appropriate in the Introduction, considering its content.

RESPONSE: The first paragraph of the discussion has now been removed and incorporated in the Introduction.

10. The phylogenetic analysis suggesting no variation between the non-contiguous Hohoe and Adalku districts raises intriguing questions about the potential prevalence of 'M. perstans' in surrounding districts. This could be an interesting avenue for future research to understand the prevalence of the parasite in the Volta region. Moreover, the discussion could be expanded to explore the possibilities of integrating 'M. perstans' surveillance with existing lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis programmes in Ghana. It would also be beneficial to discuss the broader public health implications of M. perstans, especially in relation to co-infections with other filarial diseases.

RESPONSE: The discussion has been updated to include the impact of the lack of variations in sequences on transmission in the surrounding districts as well as co-infections with other filarial parasites and the opportunities for integrating M. perstans studies in existing LF/onchocerciasis surveillance programs in the districts (lines 349-354).

Reviewer #2:

Opoku and Souza analysed M. perstans prevalence in the Volta region of Ghana and revealed low (up to 2.51%) infection rates. Moreover, they sequenced the samples and showed that the samples cluster with the reference sequences from other African countries and Brazil. It is very important to draw attention to this neglected filarial infection but the presented study lacks novelty and intense discussion (e.g., genome analysis). Moreover, the introduction and discussion lacks recent publication and is sometimes misleading. In my opinion, the manuscript need to be carefully re-written and updated before

RESPONSE: Most the sections have been updated and rearranged to help with articulation.

Major comments:

1) Line 80-82: The authors highlight that pathogenicity is not known/was so far not assessed, but the presented data sets do also not tackle this issue. Similar to Debrah et al. the presented manuscript shows the prevalence of M. perstans in a specific region of Ghana. In summary, the infection rates are very low compared to the middle belt of Ghana. The authors need to discuss that fact also in regards to the characteristics of the environment that are needed for M. perstans. For example Wanji and colleagues from Cameroon presented over the last years several publications about that.

RESPONSE: The introduction section has been updated to include prevalence from Debrah et al., 2017 and Philips et al in the middle belt (lines 90-95). The discussion has been updated with reference to environmental characteristics and comparison made with the study areas in this study (lines 331-338).

2) A long this line, the introduction need to be updated, such as Mansonella spp. DEUX is not mentioned (line 49-50), the transmitting vector for M. perstans (C. milnei) have been deciphered in Cameroon (line 50-51), and it should be mentioned that M. perstans has no distinct clinical symptoms and is mostly asymptomatic (line 55-57).

RESPONSE: These have been included in lines 315, 66-68 and 103 respectively.

3) Line 64-67: Of course, mansonellosis is still neglected but the are several studies targeting Mansonella and it cannot be stated that it is only assessed during lymphatic filariasis or onchocerciasis surveillance programmes. Again, Wanji and colleagues specifically target Mansonella epidemiology, immunology and treatment efficacy (showing that ivermectin is not effective - should be included in line 68-70).

RESPONSE: This has been addressed and the introduction has been updated indicating ivermectin is not effective in lines 105, 84)

4) In my opinion, it is important to explain the applied methods more in detail. For example, the used PCR need to be shortly explained instead of only revising to a publication. What can be differentiated with this PCR (specificity/what filarial spp can be discriminated?). A long this line, Fig S1 shows a gel blot but there is no further explanation, such as what are the different bands in the sample lines.

RESPONSE: The DNA and PCR methods have been explained in lines 160 – 215.

S1 has been changed to Fig 2 and now included in the results section and explained (lines 246, 251).

5) In regards to 4), supplement figures/tables need to be embedded, explained and in order within the text.

RESPONSE: This has been addressed accordingly.

6) How were the 30 samples that were sequences selected from the 39 positive individuals.

RESPONSE: Although there were 39 microscopy positive individuals, only samples that were positive by PCR were sequenced. This has been clarified in the text in line 213

7) line 229-230: There are several studies showing the impact of M. perstans on concomitant infections (Muhangi et al. 2007; Hillier et al. 2008; Stensgaard et al. 2016), which can be explained by the strong immune modulation of M. perstans (Ritter et al. 2018).

RESPONSE: This portion has been updated and the appropriate references inserted.

8) Recently, there are three publications about the genome of Mansonella, which need to be discussed extensively to place the presented results into the context.

RESPONSE: Recently published sequences have been mentioned and discussed.

PONE-D-23-37316R1Identification and characterisation of Mansonella perstans in the Volta Region of GhanaPLOS ONE

Dear Dr. Opoku,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.

Although I am satisfied that you have successfully delt with all of the technical concerns raised by the reviewers, there are still a number of minor presentational issues that still need to be addressed for the article to meet the publication criteria of PLOS ONE. Thus while I am not expecting to need to send the manuscript out to reviewers again, I do need you to address the minor remaining issues raised by reviewer 2 and also to address the minor issues I have identified and listed below.

LINE 88: Wolbachia is a genus name and thus should always be in italics.

LINE 94: “In Ghana, Mansonellosis was first reported in the 1991 by Awadzi and colleagues (25)”. This line needs to be changed. Mansonellosis infections are not only caused by M. ozzardi and M. perstans they are also caused by M. streptocerca and the first reports of M. streptocerca were made from samples taken in Ghana (see Macfie and Corson 1922).Macfie, J. W. S., & Corson, J. F. (1922). A new species of filarial larva found in the skin of natives in the Gold Coast. Annals of Tropical Medicine & Parasitology, 16(4), 465-471.

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: The manuscript has undergone significant improvements since the first round of peer review. Notably, the introduction now offers a comprehensive overview, effectively delineating the parasite's life cycle, geographical distribution, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, the link between mansonellosis overall and its specific relevance to Ghana has been elucidated, providing valuable context for the study. In terms of content, the methods section has been substantially expanded. Additionally, the discussion has been refined and strengthened. Overall, the manuscript has evolved positively, addressing the main concerns raised in the previous review rounds. Below are some minor points, based on the draft with tracked changes.

Abstract:

Change: Lao loa -> Loa loa (line 24)

Suggestion: Occurrence -> Co-occurrence (line 24)

Remove: "Hence," (line 25)

Change: distribution or mansonellosis -> distribution of mansonellosis (line 26)

Change: giemsa -> Giemsa (Capitalize the "G", line 31)

Clarify: lines 37-38 change to "...supporting the hypothesis that M. perstans was introduced into the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa"

Remove: Capitalization of "TransAtlantic"

Introduction:

Change: some part -> parts (line 63)

Rephrase: lines 67 and 73, Consider combining sentences or using a different structure to avoid repetition about M. perstans being in Africa.

Define: line 84, MDA (mass drug administration) on first use.

Italicize: line 88, Wolbachia

Remove: Comma after "age" in line 103

Lowercase: "Mansonellosis" unless it starts a sentence.

Methods & Results:

Clarify: Line 202, "Collared" might be unclear. Consider changing to "collected" for better understanding.

Discussion Point: Lines 316-318 may be more appropriate for the discussion?

Discussion:

Rephrase: Lines 396-402 can be rephrased to avoid repetition.

Change: line 409, suggest clarifying "supports work" -> "supports findings"

Italicize: M. perstans (line 420)

Change: Vola -> Volta (line 431)

Additional Point: Briefly mention the possibility of low prevalence due to past ivermectin distribution programs in Ghana. (paragraph starting at line 427).

Clarify: 6. I agree with the authors there should be a more comprehensive guide on the management and surveillance of M. perstans infections. However, in lines 443-450, it is not clear how low levels of M. perstans are alarming (as the prevalence found was low, albeit the limited sample size). Only if assumed that the ivermectin delivery in the past had a substantial impact on the prevalence of the parasite and, with onchocerciasis and LF elimination, ivermectin interruption could lead to the reestablishment of more M. perstans infections. Moreover, the link with malaria is not clear, despite the possible immunomodulation (as other filariae), which could make the host more susceptible to infectious diseases overall (potentially including malaria).

Overall, a brief revision for punctuation would benefit the study.

Reviewer #2: I thank the authors for the responses and clarification. In my opinion the manuscript have been improved and thus I endorse publication.

Response: Sequences has been changed to sequencing on line 54.

3. LINES 71-71: Please delete this line: Some mosquito species including Aedes and Anopheles have also been implicated (4, 10, 11). This is miss-leading and is not supported by the cited references.

Response: This line has been deleted.

4. LINE 72-74: “M. ozzardi is the major species in Latin America and the Caribbean, while M. perstans and M. streptocerca are reported in Africa.” This requires a reference, I suggest: Portela CS, Mendes de Araújo CP, Moura Sousa P, Gomes Simão CL, Silva de Oliveira JC, Crainey JL.Filarial disease in the Brazilian Amazon and emerging opportunities for treatment and control.Curr Res Parasitol Vector Borne Dis. 2023 Dec 23;5:100168. doi: 10.1016/j.crpvbd.2023.100168. eCollection 2024.

Response: Wolbachia has been italicised on line 89.

6. LINE 94: “In Ghana, Mansonellosis was first reported in the 1991 by Awadzi and colleagues (25)”. This line needs to be changed. Mansonellosis infections are not only caused by M. ozzardi and M. perstans they are also caused by M. streptocerca and the first reports of M. streptocerca were made from samples taken in Ghana (see Macfie and Corson 1922). Macfie, J. W. S., & Corson, J. F. (1922). A new species of filarial larva found in the skin of natives in the Gold Coast. Annals of Tropical Medicine & Parasitology, 16(4), 465-471.

Response: The statement has been corrected and now reads “The first report of mansonellosis was in 1922 where, M. streptocerca was identified in the skin of indigenes from Gold Coast, now Ghana” and the reference included on lines 95-96.

7. LINES 133-114: ) “as well as vaccine uptake (1, 5, 36).” Should it not be efficacy instead of uptake?

Response: “uptake” has been replaced with “efficacy”

9. LINES 152-153:Change to: ”A, showing the map of Ghana with the districts where samples were collected.”

10. LINES 155-156: This does not make sense, please revise: “shows the Hohoe district (Volta Region) in orange with communities in grey and yellow circles for M. perstans negative and positives respectively that were positive for”. Please also always put M. perstans in italics.

Response: Lines have been changed and reads “A, showing the map of Ghana with the districts where samples were collected. B, shows the East Akyim district (comprising the Abuakwa North and South Districts (Eastern Region)) in green with communities sampled in pale orange circles. C, shows the Hohoe district (Volta Region) in orange. D, shows three districts (Adaklu, Agotime Ziope and Central Tongu Districts in purple, grey and brown respectively) also in the Volta Region. Communities sampled are in circles with yellow and grey indicating sites with M. perstans positives and negatives respectively” on lines 157 -163.

M. perstans is now italicised on line 163.

10. LINES 174-176: Change to: “The liquid containing DNA was transferred (whilst ensuring that no particles of the filter paper is pipetted with the sample) to a Zymo-Spin™ IICR Column placed in a Collection Tube.”

Response: the sentence has been modified and now reads “The liquid containing the DNA was transferred to a Zymo-Spin™ IICR Column placed in a Collection Tube (ensure that no particles of the filter paper is pipetted with the sample).” Lines 178-180.

11. LINES 212-213: “visualised under blue led light.” Should this be UV light?

Response: The gel was visualised with a blue light transilluminator not the usual UV light using the Dual LED Blue/White Light Transilluminator machine from Bio-Helix. The name of the machine has been indicated on line 216.

12. LINE 260: Change to: Fig 2. Gel electrophoresis photograph showing Nest II PCR products.

Response: Gel electrogram has been changed to Gel electrophoresis photograph on line 263.

Reviewer #2

Abstract:

1. Change: Lao loa -> Loa loa (line 24)

Response: Lao has been changed to Loa on line 24

2. Suggestion: Occurrence -> Co-occurrence (line 24)

Response: Occurrence has been changed to co-occurrence on line 23

3. Remove: "Hence," (line 25)

Response: This has been removed. Also, the sentence has been modified to now read “There are few surveillance programmes for assessing the distribution of mansonellosis, due to the associated mild to no symptoms experienced by infected people” on lines 24-25.

4. Change: distribution or mansonellosis -> distribution of mansonellosis (line 26)

Response: “or” has been changed to “of” on line 25.

5. Change: giemsa -> Giemsa (Capitalize the "G", line 31)

Response: giemsa has been correct to start with a capital “G” on line 30.

6. Clarify: lines 37-38 change to "...supporting the hypothesis that M. perstans was introduced into the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa"

Remove: Capitalization of "TransAtlantic"

Response: Since there is no strong evidence in this study to draw this conclusion, the sentences have been modified to “Phylogenetic analysis of 194 nucleotide positions showed no differences in the samples collected. The similarities suggests that there could be one species in this area. However, more robust studies with larger sample sizes are required to draw such conclusions. We also observed a clustering of the samples from Ghana with reference sequences from Africa and Brazil, suggesting they could be related. This study draws further attention to a neglected infection, presents the first characterisation of M. perstans in Ghana and calls for more population-based studies across different geographical zones to ascertain species variations and disease distribution”. Lines 34-40.

Introduction:

7. Change: some part -> parts (line 63)

Response: “some part” has been changed to “parts”.

8. Rephrase: lines 67 and 73, Consider combining sentences or using a different structure to avoid repetition about M. perstans being in Africa.

Response: The paragraph has been modified accordingly.

9. Define: line 84, MDA (mass drug administration) on first use.

Response: The MDA has been written in full on line 85.

10. Italicize: line 88, Wolbachia

Response: This has been done on line 89.

11. Remove: Comma after "age" in line 103

Response: the comma has been removed on line 106.

12. Lowercase: "Mansonellosis" unless it starts a sentence.

Response: This has been corrected on line 111 and 114.

Methods & Results:

13. Clarify: Line 202, "Collared" might be unclear. Consider changing to "collected" for better understanding.

Response: This has been corrected on line 158

14. Discussion Point: Lines 316-318 may be more appropriate for the discussion?

Response: This has been addressed in the discussion section.

Discussion:

15. Rephrase: Lines 396-402 can be rephrased to avoid repetition.

Response: These lines have been reviewed

16. Change: line 409, suggest clarifying "supports work" -> "supports findings"

Response: This section has been reviewed and now reads “The clustering of the Ghana samples and other sequences from Gabon and Sierra Leone with the M. perstans ITS-1 (LT623911.1) from Brazil Amazona State (Fig 4) and other countries in Africa provides evidence of association. supports Findings work by of Tavares da Silva and colleagues (25) that also showed that a recently published genome of M. perstans from Brazil shared similarity with those from Africa.”

Italicize: M. perstans (line 420)

17. Change: Vola -> Volta (line 431)

Response: This has been corrected on line 355.

18. Additional Point: Briefly mention the possibility of low prevalence due to past ivermectin distribution programs in Ghana. (paragraph starting at line 427).

Response: Possibility of IVM contributing to low prevalence and the consequences of stopping IVM treatment in these areas has been incorporated on lines 344-346.

19. Clarify: 6. I agree with the authors there should be a more comprehensive guide on the management and surveillance of M. perstans infections. However, in lines 443-450, it is not clear how low levels of M. perstans are alarming (as the prevalence found was low, albeit the limited sample size). Only if assumed that the ivermectin delivery in the past had a substantial impact on the prevalence of the parasite and, with onchocerciasis and LF elimination, ivermectin interruption could lead to the reestablishment of more M. perstans infections. Moreover, the link with malaria is not clear, despite the possible immunomodulation (as other filariae), which could make the host more susceptible to infectious diseases overall (potentially including malaria).

Response: This portion has been reviewed and emphasis is now on the possibility of resurgence should IVM be discontinued in this area. Lines 343-347. Also, the impact on malaria infections have been clarified on lines 360-373.

20. Overall, a brief revision for punctuation would benefit the study.

Response: The manuscript has been reviewed and punctuations checked.
